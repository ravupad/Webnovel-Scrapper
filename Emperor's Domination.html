<h4>Chapter 1217: One Massacring One Million</h4>
<p>Chapter 1217: One Massacring One Million</p>
<p>With that, Li Qiye glared at the Teeming Tribemaster and grinned: “Only an inept bunch boasting about how vicious you are every day. How domineering and aggressive, but ultimately, you’re still a bunch of turtles hiding in their shells.”</p>
<p>Such contempt left the spectators slack-jawed. No one had ever thought that they would hear this level of blatant disdain towards the Teeming Fish.</p>
<p>However, some secretly applauded him, especially those who had been bullied by this tribe before. They felt especially happy since his words resonated with their own thoughts.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, many knew that the Teeming Fish knew to pick their opponents very well. They weren’t ferocious to just anyone. For example, great hegemons like the Golden Isle, the Void Imperfection Three Schools, and Gu Chun’s Four Branches weren’t provoked by the Teeming Fish. Otherwise, they would have been slaughtered by the Immortal Emperors, treefathers and sea demons countless times.</p>
<p>As for the other sects, they weren’t strong enough to kill all of the fish so more often than not, they would suffer losses to these fish without voicing their displeasure.</p>
<p>“He’s right. Hmph! Rumor has it that the grand completion Immortal Physique users of Gu Chun’s Four Branches loved to eat dragon tendons, but no one has heard of the Teeming Fish attacking the four branches for revenge.” Someone couldn’t help say this out of dissatisfaction towards the Teeming Tribe.</p>
<p>His senior was frightened and immediately covered his mouth. He slapped him and stated: “Are you tired of living? Even if you are, don’t drag the sect into this.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s words darkened the tribemaster’s old face. He felt like his chest would explode from anger as he trembled.</p>
<p>The million fish in the sea had fire in their eyes while glaring at Li Qiye. If glares could kill, then Li Qiye would have died countless times already.</p>
<p>A Teeming Fish angrily shouted: “Tribemaster, let us tear this little animal to pieces so our brothers can eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Let us eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!” The other fish immediately echoed the sentiment. Their furious roars soared to the sky and shook the sea.</p>
<p>Many cultivators were aghast after feeling the wrath of the fish and turned pale. Today was the day that they would witness the ferocity of the Teeming Tribe.</p>
<p>“Devour me?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile before leisurely replying: “With a bunch of trash like you? Not to mention this army of one million, even if the billions of Teeming Fish in the Heaven Spirit World were here, I still wouldn’t give a damn.”</p>
<p>This direct provocation left people exchanging glances with each other. Here were more than ten high elders of the tribe and even the tribemaster himself. At least ten Virtuous Paragons were here, not to mention the vast armies of soldiers.</p>
<p>The tribemaster shouted: “Little beast, you will experience a fate worse than death! We shall stomp on your bones! My children! Feast on him!”</p>
<p>“Kill!” The furious army crazily cried out before frenziedly rushing for Peacock Land. These waves of fish slammed straight towards the island as if wanting to break it apart.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and, with a buzz, a law emerged from his heavenly cauldron.</p>
<p>“Rumble!” In a split second, bubbles sprayed out of the sea. These bubbles looked just like little palms that began to grab the Teeming Fish. They grabbed all of them without exception despite their great numbers. Even the group of the tribemaster couldn’t escape. All were caught by these palms made out of water.</p>
<p>“Activate!” The shocked fish took action and tried to slash through these palm-shaped bubbles. However, this water had been refined by Li Qiye to be one with the ocean. How could these Teeming Fish cut through it?</p>
<p>“Too late.” Li Qiye gently smiled. With a boom, this area suddenly formed little cauldrons that ignited. The fiery cauldrons turned into huge palms that descended from the sky to grab the heads of these fish.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Miserable screams echoed across this land. These screams resonated with each other, creating a hellish scene. While listening to the ups and downs of this grim melody, anyone would feel that they were trapped in hell.</p>
<p>“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” The hands made out of water began to pull. These fish’s heads and bodies were separated, and even their spines were being pulled out. This was an extremely scary spectacle.</p>
<p>The tribemaster screamed: “No!” His body was being abnormally elongated. He tried to escape from the hands, but he still failed despite being a Virtuous Paragon.</p>
<p>Eventually, he let out one last shriek and couldn’t escape the fate of decapitation like the rest.</p>
<p>“It would be a shame to waste all of these lives.” Li Qiye smirked.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The cauldron flame changed again. These bubbles turned into stoves and instantly refined the million bodies into ashes. Their vitality was taken away and sucked into the Myriad Heavenly Cauldron.</p>
<p>At this time, the flame that came from the sky turned into crimson chains and hung the fish heads in the sky.</p>
<p>This scene was too spectacular and terrifying. The fish heads — still connected to their spines — were suspended in the air.</p>
<p>“Blegh!” One person couldn’t bear this horrible scene and began to vomit. Many cultivators ran away from fear.</p>
<p>Cultivators were accustomed to death, but slaughtering one million in one breath was truly rare. Not to mention, these fish were still hanging in the sky. This was a scene that no one had ever seen before.</p>
<p>“It was a trap!” The paled and dazed crowd finally realized that a terrifying trap was planted in this area in advance.</p>
<p>They also understood why Li Qiye warned everyone to stay out of the circle he drew. So it turned out that he was reminding people lest they be caught up in this as well.</p>
<p>Prior to this, they thought he had an ulterior motive, but it turned out that he warned them with good intentions. Cold chills emanated from within as they began to sweat. They only left the circle to make way for the Teeming Fish. If it wasn’t for that, their ends could have been the same as these fish before them.</p>
<p>“This must be a grand formation that harmonizes with the heaven and earth. Its power must be wondrous and must have taken more than just one day to set up.” A grand character from the previous generation understood the power of this trap after seeing the Teeming Tribemaster being unable to escape.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sweep through the crowd with his eyes and slowly uttered: “Go tell the Teeming Fish that I will be waiting here at Peacock Land. If they want revenge, bring it on. Or, they can cower with their tails tucked between their legs and never show their faces in the Heaven Spirit World again.”</p>
<p>A lot of people’s hearts skipped a beat after hearing this declaration of war. Li Qiye had set up a grand formation here to wait for more Teeming Fish.</p>
<p>Eventually, he looked at the few human cultivators and coldly spoke: “It is time for the human race to leave.”</p>
<p>These humans shuddered and some of them left immediately. However, a few chose to stay in order to see the outcome of this storm.</p>
<p>News of Li Qiye’s move spread across the entire Jade Sea in a flash. The listeners batted their brows after hearing about his massacre.</p>
<p>“This person is ruthless with great schemes. Who expected him to kill one million Teeming Fish in this manner?” A sect master murmured with fear in his mind.</p>
<p>“War is coming, the Teeming Fish will definitely not let this go.” A big shot from the Treant Race commented as well.</p>
<p>“Not just them, the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse won’t let this go either, or else they’ll lose all face in the Heaven Spirit World.” An ancestor gently sighed.</p>
<p>In a short amount of time, the Jade Sea turned quiet. Many people were looking forward to the events at Peacock Land. However, they were not concerned about the Peacock Tree. Their eyes were on Li Qiye.</p>
<p>They all understood that his opponents had two choices: they could either fight a direct battle or avoid this trap and find opportunities to kill him later.</p>
<p>However, avoiding this battle would be a huge blow to their prestige. The reputation established by their forefathers would be shattered overnight. If they were afraid of a single human boy, how could they guard their own territories in the future?</p>
<p>By enduring the shame of having a million of their children massacred, no one would fear the Teeming Fish later on!</p>

<h4>Chapter 1218: Declaration Of War From A Million Kingdoms</h4>
<p>Chapter 1218: Declaration Of War From A Million Kingdoms</p>
<p>After a few days, the Jade Sea and the Teeming Fish were still silent. There were no movements from them.</p>
<p>However, experienced big shots could smell that something in the air had changed: “The calm before the raging storm, who knows who the ultimate victor will be?”</p>
<p>Everyone understood that Li Qiye had planted a trap for the Teeming Fish. At this moment, the question was whether these fish would jump into this pit or not.</p>
<p>Several more days passed and the Teeming Tribe was still quiet. At this time, everyone thought that they had given up.</p>
<p>“Li, listen up, my Nightcrystal Kingdom will accept the challenge. We shall have vengeance for our million dead brothers. We will not only kill you, but also your ten clans!” Eventually, one kingdom rose to the challenge. Its king sent out this fierce message.</p>
<p>“A mountain of blades and a sea of fire still won’t be able to stop our Stonecloud Citadel’s determination for revenge. We shall slay Li Qiye!” Another lineage replied to Li Qiye’s challenge.</p>
<p>“Without killing Li Qiye’s ten clans, our eight million strong Eastern Sea Kingdom will never return to our home!” One more declared war on Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“No matter how far you may be, we shall chase you to the very end for the crime of killing our comrades. Our Propitious Sea Kingdom shall offer Li Qiye’s head to our fallen brothers!” Another joined the fray.</p>
<p>*** *** ***</p>
<p>In a short period of time, the Teeming Fish from all over the seas accepted the challenge in succession. They all swore to kill Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Their cries echoed across the vast oceans, frightening many cultivators and lineages.</p>
<p>Before this, the Teeming Fish claimed to have millions of kingdoms. Of course, people knew that this was only an exaggeration. However, after seeing one kingdom after another rising up against Li Qiye, they realized for a second time just how powerful and pervasive this tribe was.</p>
<p>Another thing to note was that the tribe had been incredibly quiet the past several days, but in just one night, numerous Teeming kingdoms declared war all at once. People could faintly guess something from this.</p>
<p>“Very good, come then, my butcher’s blade is waiting. Bring ten million, slay ten million, bring one trillion, I’ll slay one trillion! And as for the Immaculate Expanse and the Extreme Yang School, there’s no need to hide any longer, my blade is anxious to have its fill of your blood.” Li Qiye’s response was also quite fierce.</p>
<p>“Insufferable Little Qiye, our Immaculate Expanse vows to never give up until you die.” The expanse responded without any reservation.</p>
<p>“Human child, even if you prepare an inferno of blades, the greatest of formations, our Extreme Yang School will still annihilate you completely!” The Extreme Yang School sent out their answer as well.</p>
<p>“Count our Ophidian Tribe in as well!” Another enemy of Li Qiye released a message.</p>
<p>“And my Dual-Pupils Sect!” The sect master of this lineage also sent out a strong message: “Kill Li Qiye to rid the Heaven Spirit World of his evil!”</p>
<p>“Very well, the nobodies want to play too. I don’t mind more debts; all of you can come, little children. Your grandfather will be waiting for you at Peacock Land!” Li Qiye’s laughter resounded across the ocean with an incomparably arrogant tone!</p>
<p>Such an overbearing attitude left many people dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Someone murmured: “This is how a man should be. Challenging the entire world with one’s own strength. Even if he dies, his life would still have been full of glory!”</p>
<p>“Rumble!” On this day, huge waves were thrown into the sky and blotted out the sun. The entire Jade Sea was shaking because of this.</p>
<p>The horizon turned white after loud explosions due to the monstrous waves being pushed up. If one had a high vantage point to look down from, they would definitely be rewarded with a majestic scene.</p>
<p>Peacock Land was the area of the world's focus. Hordes of Teeming Fish came from all directions. Each legion had a different system and formation as they surged for this place.</p>
<p>The countless kingdoms had mobilized at the same time with billions of fish in their armies. In both the sky and the ocean, only Teeming Fish could be found.</p>
<p>There was no end to them, their ranks spanning as far as the eyes could see. Anywhere that light could reach was occupied by fish.</p>
<p>The troops of this tribe from all over the world gathered to form a mighty army.</p>
<p>“Oh mommy, the Teeming Fish are using all of their forces!” Many people nearly wet their pants after seeing this lineup. Those who came for the treasures no longer dared to linger behind and quickly ran away from this land of turmoil.</p>
<p>“Damn humans!” Some of the human cultivators who were already here wanted to escape. However, the perimeter of Peacock Land was completely sealed by the Teeming Fish. These fleeing cultivators suffered attacks right away.</p>
<p>Even though they were quite strong, they still couldn’t escape death for they faced billions of Teeming Fish. With miserable screams, they were instantly eaten by them. Not even traces of their bones were left behind.</p>
<p>They died full of regret for not listening to Li Qiye earlier. If they had left as soon as possible, they wouldn’t have attracted this fatal disaster, resulting in a death without a burial.</p>
<p>“Take out the heavenly mirrors.” Many lineages were worried about this grand event. No one apart from top experts dared to personally come and watch. The majority of the lineages didn’t want to miss this unique battle, so they didn’t mind wasting refined jades to activate their heavenly mirrors.</p>
<p>Through the mirrors, they could watch the battlefield full of Teeming Fish.</p>
<p>Fish heads were bobbing back and forth. The ferocious army was armed with tridents and harpoons. The glint of their weapons illuminated the whole sea. This was not a friendly sight for cowards to watch.</p>
<p>Even the sect masters and royal lords were creeped out by this. The billion-strong army could tear through everything. Just a few bites from each of the soldiers could destroy an entire great power.</p>
<p>“Messing with the Teeming Fish is like playing with a hornet’s nest.” A sect master murmured while breaking out in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Another royal lord commented with anxiety: “Who would want to provoke these vicious fish alone outside of sea gods, treefathers, and Immortal Emperors?”</p>
<p>“They aren’t only trying to kill Li Qiye for revenge this time. This is a showing of their military might, deterring the world by showing their frightening strength, lest others want to suffer the fate of genocide.” An ancestor was quite discerning.</p>
<p>In fact, a few older ancestors knew this full well, especially those from experienced lineages like the Golden Isle or the Void Imperfection Three Schools. They had been around for too long.</p>
<p>Li Qiye had dealt a great blow to the Teeming Fish to the point of trampling on their reputation and prestige.</p>
<p>Eating dragon tendons publicly was humiliating to this tribe, but now, he even massacred a million fish and killed the symbol of their race — their tribemaster. This was shaking the very foundation and status of their tribe in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
<p>If they didn’t kill him today, they would never be able to regain their fierce reputation. Perhaps the world would start to think that they were easily bullied. Many lineages would want to seize their territories and people would want to eat dragon tendons.</p>
<p>Because of this, the tribe had united and managed to muster billions of troops. This was not only to kill Li Qiye, but also to show off their might and solidarity as a deterrent measure. Provoke them and face genocide!</p>
<p>The Teeming experts crowded the sky and the sea. The terrifying experts up there were all in human form.</p>
<p>These old men were dressed in gold and wore regal clothing since they were high elders and kings. There was no lack of Virtuous Paragons here.</p>
<p>Of course, it was difficult to find a God-Monarch in the Teeming Tribe. The fish were quite weak in terms of cultivation. Not to mention charming spirits, they were very far behind compared to even ordinary sea demons.</p>
<p>However, due to their large population, they still had quite a few Virtuous Paragons. The hard part was to have one of these paragons reach the God-Monarch level.</p>
<p>Despite the exaggeration in the rhetoric regarding their numbers, the mass ahead was indeed too immense. No other lineage could gather so many children. This magnificent scene was something only the Teeming Fish could produce.</p>
<p>Eventually, their kingdoms finished gathering their troops. At this time, the ophidian treants and Dual-Pupils Sect along with another dozen lineages had aggregated to form an alliance with the Teeming Fish to assault Peacock Land.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1219: The Teeming Fish On The Offensive</h4>
<p>Chapter 1219: The Teeming Fish On The Offensive</p>
<p>“Boom!” The billions of fish attacking Peacock Land created a spectacular scene. Just the tidal waves rushing to the sky had an unstoppable momentum.</p>
<p>Anyone would be aghast since the entire Jade Sea was quaking from their advance. Eventually, they stopped right outside the circle drawn by Li Qiye since they knew of the terrible trap waiting inside.</p>
<p>The army looked at the millions of fish bones hanging in the sky and their fury rose uncontrollably. From foot soldiers all the way to fish kings, all reddened with rage and wanted nothing more than to tear Li Qiye apart.</p>
<p>A Teeming King screamed: “We shall never return to our kingdoms before killing that little beast!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Never return until we kill his ten clans as well!” The shouts of these fish echoed to the sky.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye was still sitting at the base of the Peacock Tree. He lazily stood up to look at the horde and revealed a gentle smile: “I have always been a merciful and peace-loving person, so I shall grant all of you one last chance. Immediately scurry back to your homes like good little fish or I’ll kill all of you to the very root.”</p>
<p>Such words enraged the fish even more. They angrily glared at him with intense murderous intent, more than enough to kill him thousands of times over.</p>
<p>“Little beast, today will be your demise!” A fish king hovering in the sky shouted: “We’ll not only kill you, we’ll devour this land as well! But before that, we’ll take our time torturing you until you reveal your identity, then we’ll finish off your ten clans. Both the young and old men and women in your clans will cry in agony for the rest of their lives for daring to provoke our tribe’s prestige.”</p>
<p>“A group of ants daring to talk about slaughtering a true dragon.” Li Qiye burst out in laughter: “None of you are qualified, not even if you had more people!”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Another fish king snorted: “Keep on gloating. You won’t be able to do so soon.”</p>
<p>Through the heavenly mirrors, the spectators were still holding their breaths despite being countless miles away.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, please break this formation.” A fish king shouted at the horizon in order to call for reinforcements.</p>
<p>“Bang!” A great formation consisting of more than ten exceedingly powerful charming spirit experts descended from the sky. It was easy to tell that they were at least at the high elder level due to their gray hair.</p>
<p>Flames covered them as this grand formation was coming down. This terrifying fire instantly suppressed the area in a frightening fashion.</p>
<p>“The Commanding Elder of the Extreme Yang School!” A sect master recognized the leader through the heavenly mirror.</p>
<p>“Boom!” Flames fell from the sky while bubbles soared from the water. Li Qiye’s formation immediately attacked the high elders.</p>
<p>“Activate!” The elders shouted together and took out a cauldron. Their formation supported this cauldron, turning it into a gigantic divine cauldron.</p>
<p>“Boom! Boom!” Explosions rang nonstop. This immortal cauldron crazily absorbed the flames from Li Qiye’s cauldron. Even the bubbles and seawater that had fused with his fire were absorbed, with the remnants falling back into the ocean.</p>
<p>A royal lord murmured: “Extreme Yang Cauldron, rumored to be a great formation created by a grand completion Immortal Physique user.”</p>
<p>“Not bad.” Li Qiye smiled. One could hear a crash followed by loud blasts. Countless laws surged from the sea in the form of gigantic chains. Each of them was as mighty as a mountain range; they tried to lock the Extreme Yang Cauldron.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it!” At this time, one more great formation appeared in the sky. The clanging of swords reverberated continuously as huge swords flew to the sky like blooming lotuses. With the blooming of these lotuses, the universal laws from the sea became much weaker.</p>
<p>“Law Evading Sword Formation!” Someone else recognized this formation from the mirror and shouted: “This is the great formation of the Immaculate Expanse.”</p>
<p>Without a doubt, both the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse paid a huge price to utilize their great formations. They wouldn’t give up until Li Qiye died.</p>
<p>An old man inside the sword formation cried out: “Elders, together!”</p>
<p>“Buzz!” Both the cauldron and sword formation exerted their maximum power. First, the cauldron was absorbing the fire from Li Qiye’s cauldron while the sword law evaded the chains made out of laws. It took all the grand dao power away from this technique.</p>
<p>Under the two great formations, Li Qiye’s trap finally shattered since both his fire and chains were cut off.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The formations continued to maintain their highest level of power to suppress this region. In other words, if Li Qiye still had more traps or techniques placed here, they wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p>
<p>“Little animal, your trick is just child’s play — can’t reach the apex.” A commanding elder of the Extreme Yang School spoke coldly after seeing the two formations working as planned.</p>
<p>A high elder from this sect coldly uttered: “Killing our Immaculate Expanse disciples is deserving of ten thousand deaths! Be damned!”</p>
<p>At this time, they felt that Li Qiye couldn’t do anything against the two formations even if he had other means. He was a fish on the chopping board, waiting to be killed.</p>
<p>“It is too difficult for one person to shake a lineage.” Someone murmured while staring at a heavenly mirror.</p>
<p>A royal lord said with worry: “The expanse, the Extreme Yang School, and the Teeming Fish are quite scary when they are working together. It looks like Li Qiye is really pushing them this time.”</p>
<p>An ancestor lamented: “What a shame, this is a hero. The human race will lose such a good seed. This is what happens when you are too brittle and inflexible. His future was unlimited, but he was too arrogant and made too many enemies at once. This is him walking to his death.”</p>
<p>“Little beast, today will be your funeral!” A fish king shouted: “Brothers, rush into Peacock Land. No dangers will deter our advance, we shall devour the entire land and tear this little beast into pieces!”</p>
<p>“Devour the land! Tear the little beast into pieces!” The army chanted in unison. Their battle cry shook even the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Endless streams of Teeming Fish rushed for Peacock Land. At this moment, nothing Li Qiye did could deter their determination to destroy him. They were still far from reaching the land itself, but their momentum was already impacting the entire land.</p>
<p>Li Qiye showed no sign of worry and instead revealed a beaming smile: “That was just for fun, now it is time for the real harvest.”</p>
<p>Having said that, a buzz resounded. The Peacock Tree behind him suddenly emitted a blinding light of all kinds of colors.</p>
<p>This divine light soared to the sky and overfilled the sky vault. It opened the nine heavens and derived a timeless primordial chaos.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?” This sudden change caught everyone off guard.</p>
<p>This light turned into a huge tail. The Peacock Tree suddenly disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>A huge peacock emerged in the sky. Its wings blotted out the sun, suddenly turning the world dark. All that remained was the brilliance of the peacock and its five colors. The entire Jade Sea was illuminated by this five-colored divine light.</p>
<p>“Whoosh!” The peacock spread its tail. In an instant, a truly invincible aura pervaded the entire Heaven Spirit World.</p>
<p>There were no laws or moves, just the spreading of the bird’s tail suppressed all living beings. Even powerful paragons and terrifying God-Monarchs felt that they were mere ants before this invincible aura. They were too fragile and couldn’t reach the apex.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The peacock’s tail swept by and the billion Teeming Fish were suppressed. Both the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation were stopped as well.</p>
<p>At this moment, neither paragons nor the powerful formations could move at all; they were completely pinned down. Even time and space were paused like a painting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1220: Blood Refining All The Teeming Fish</h4>
<p>Chapter 1220: Blood Refining All The Teeming Fish</p>
<p>The Jade Sea was obscured by the peacock. It suppressed this entire world; even the top experts were watching this creature in silence.</p>
<p>In a forbidden ground, an existence woke up and opened its eyes in the abyss, its dry bones radiating divinity.</p>
<p>The majestic bird horrified all invincible existences. This was an unstoppable offense capable of sweeping through everything.</p>
<p>“The Peacock Treefather.” Someone muttered in a very distant location.</p>
<p>At this time, the ancient clans and powerful lineages were nervous with their hair standing on end.</p>
<p>Even more lineages activated their heavenly mirrors. Many ancestors felt the impulse to kneel while looking at this scene.</p>
<p>The exceedingly strong ancestors from behemoths like the Golden Isle and Void Imperfection Three Schools were astounded as well.</p>
<p>A gray-haired ancestor gasped: “Is the treefather coming back to life?”</p>
<p>The ancestors in this Void Imperfection sect couldn’t believe their eyes and murmured: “No chance. Once a treefather returns to the earth, it should be irreversible.”</p>
<p>“This is not a resurrection.” The Golden Isle was a treefather lineage, so they knew much more. An ancestor murmured: “This is the treefather showing its spirit. Is it about to extend its life?”</p>
<p>They knew that it was prohibitively difficult for a treefather to show its spirit. Outside of when their sects were facing imminent doom, they wouldn’t show their spirit even when they were about to wither.</p>
<p>“I thought I would need to work much harder for the refinement this time… But the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation will act as the best alchemy furnace.” Li Qiye smiled while watching this scene.</p>
<p>“Open!” He shouted. With a buzzing noise, this location lit up. The peacock’s tail suddenly spun in the air.</p>
<p>An incredible thing happened. With sizzles, all of the frozen Teeming Fish were being erased.</p>
<p>Their bodies seemed to be under the grinding of a polishing stone and slowly faded away. They could only watch as inches of their flesh were being removed; they couldn’t move or even scream.</p>
<p>This terrible scene included the members of the Ophidian Tribe, the Dual-Pupils Sect, and their allied lineages. Nearly one hundred thousand disciples from these lineages were slowly being erased.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, this process continued across the lowest level of foot soldiers to the top paragon high elders, none could escape this fate.</p>
<p>Eventually, both the fish and cultivators were ground into pools of blood. This was the most precious thing in their bodies — the blood that contained their longevity.</p>
<p>All of these blood pools came together. Just imagine the sheer amount of accumulated blood from a billion fish. It cemented together into a bloody sea.</p>
<p>“What…” Those watching through the mirrors were creeped out and trembled. A billion fish were ended just like this.</p>
<p>“Bang!” The Extreme Yang Cauldron controlled by more than ten high elders suddenly lit up. They had lost control of this great formation.</p>
<p>“Splash! Splash! Crash!” At this time, Li Qiye took over the Extreme Yang Cauldron. The inexhaustible amount of blood was being fed to it.</p>
<p>The sunfire within turned into a vortex in order to refine the endless amount of blood. During this process, the high elders inside the formation found their bodies slowly melting away. Their fire of life started to burn and the addition of their blood purified the mass even further.</p>
<p>“Did you really think that a formation like the Extreme Yang Cauldron could swallow my cauldron fire? How naive. In this world, nothing is purer than the fire of life when it comes to alchemy refinement. Using your fire to refine and nourish the blood for a second time is truly perfect.” Li Qiye refined the sea-like blood using the Extreme Yang Cauldron.</p>
<p>Eventually, all of the blood was refined and the sea of blood shrunk into a lake. The Extreme Yang Cauldron shattered as well. The high elders had become part of the blood, so they were destroyed as well.</p>
<p>“Splash—” Li Qiye poured all of the Void Imperfection Water into the Law Avoiding Sword Formation. The high elders from the expanse that set up this formation could only watch themselves being drowned by it.</p>
<p>“Void Imperfection Water, the supreme sacred aqua of the charming spirits.” Many people were envious to see Li Qiye using so much water to drown out the sword formation. They felt that he was being too wasteful.</p>
<p>For charming spirits, even a single bottle of this water was extremely precious, but Li Qiye ignored all of that.</p>
<p>“Clank!” The high elders had lost control of their sword formation. The formation turned into an incomparably holy giant lotus. This was the ultimate form of this formation, capable of purifying and evading everything.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The Void Imperfection Water turned into a cauldron inside the lotus flower. At this moment, the purifying force of the formation was being pushed to the limit. The recently refined lake of blood was being sucked into this new cauldron.</p>
<p>The lotus flower closed its petals and the blood was refined once more. Moreover, the high elders stuck inside felt their fate palaces opening. Their spring of life continuously flowed into the cauldron and was being thoroughly refined.</p>
<p>Their blood energy, longevity blood, and dao force were gathered into their spring of life, and its water continued to pour outside. Their fate ended up being the same as the elders from the Extreme Yang School — slowly melting away.</p>
<p>Even though this process didn’t look that scary, they were being robbed of everything. It drained their entire being and left behind nothing.</p>
<p>“Using the fire of life to warm the blood and the water of life to purify it, nothing can be better than this.” Li Qiye smiled while controlling the cauldron: “It would have been too cruel if I had to catch dozens of experts to refine them alive into this medicine, right? Unfortunately, you all didn’t heed my warning and decided to come seek death by turning yourselves into medicine.”</p>
<p>“The even bigger coincidence is that the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation are quite suitable for medicine creation. The merit laws created by your grand completion Immortal Physique users consist of unrivaled hardness and peerless softness. Coming here to be part of my medicine creation, what else can I say? Thank you for helping me save a lot of time.” Li Qiye leisurely explained the process while refining the blood.</p>
<p>After seeing this, an ancestor from the Void Imperfection School wondered: “Is this really a coincidence?”</p>
<p>Eventually, the lotus flower withered and the blood was tempered once more. At this time, it no longer looked like blood, its appearance was closer to a treasure liquid. It exuded a wondrous light.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was a lake of blood, but now this liquid was reduced to the size of a pond. There was primordial chaos lingering inside this pond, as if a world of stars was about to be born within. An entire universe was being gestated.</p>
<p>“This kind of treasure liquid can really compare to chaos essence.” Many people were salivating while looking at this liquid. Even those without a clue still knew how precious it was.</p>
<p>This was a liquid refined from a billion Teeming Fish. Its value could only be imagined.</p>
<p>Li Qiye took out the Heavenvine Calabash and began to cut it. An ordinary golden liquid poured out from inside, releasing a vibrant force of life. Each drop of this golden liquid contained infinite vigor. He added this golden liquid into the pond.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The two instantly fused together. At this time, everyone in the Jade Sea could feel a breeze full of exuberant life force hitting them. There seemed to be an extremely vigorous life being born in this pond of water, capable of taking root in the earth!</p>
<p>Countless existences in the Jade Sea felt the great vitality being created. Even a dying piece of dry wood would have a second spring.</p>
<p>“He is actually replenishing the life of the Peacock Tree so it can live longer!” An ancestor was dazed in front of their mirror. They finally understood what Li Qiye was trying to do!</p>
<p>Countless spectators were astounded, some were moved, and many were silenced.</p>
<p>Prior to this, someone had asked what Li Qiye was trying to do, and he answered truthfully. At that time, many people mocked and snorted at him. They viewed him with disdain and thought that this fool didn’t know his own limits.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1221: Life Replenishment</h4>
<p>Chapter 1221: Life Replenishment</p>
<p>However, in retrospect, the fool was not Li Qiye, but them. The most foolish were the Teeming Fish. Their arrogance and aggressiveness only helped Li Qiye in the end.</p>
<p>“If I could have a share of this vitality, I would be able to live for another generation.” An ancestor murmured while feeling the abundant life force permeating through the world.</p>
<p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Thunder sounded in the sky with frantic lightning sparks. In the blink of an eye, a terrifying tribulation formed.</p>
<p>This tribulation coalesced and the entire world turned dark as if the end of days was approaching. Each lightning bolt could tear apart this world or blow up an ocean.</p>
<p>It formed incredibly quickly. Not to mention ordinary experts, even a Godking would be absolutely horrified. They would have to calculate how long they could survive this tribulation.</p>
<p>A junior saw this tribulation and felt his legs go soft before murmuring in a daze: “What is that?”</p>
<p>“The heavens’ punishment...” An ancestor slowly explained: “This type of life liquid made from a billion existences is a heaven-defying item. It goes against the harmonious order of this world, so the high heavens will definitely not allow for such an item to be created. The liquid itself might be innocent, but the drinkers will be committing a heinous sin!”</p>
<p>A different disciple asked: “Will the Peacock Tree be able to withstand this tribulation?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” This ancestor gently shook his head: “The stronger the person is, the stronger the heavens’ punishment will be. The tree’s original form is a treefather, thus it will have an invincible foundation. If it drinks this liquid of life, it will bring about a real heavenly annihilation! If it was someone weaker like a junior, then their seniors or experts could help them surpass this tribulation, but no one apart from an Immortal Emperor can help a treefather’s punishment!”</p>
<p>Everyone watched their mirrors with bated breaths. They wanted to see whether the tree would drink this pond of valuable liquid or not.</p>
<p>Li Qiye rushed to the sky after seeing the tribulation. He took out the jade bowl filled with the tears of mortals. At this time, he splashed it on the peacock itself while the peacock absorbed it all.</p>
<p>After doing so, the bird emitted a faint brilliance of a crystal clear shade. Each wisp of light seemed to be stained with tears, as if countless commoners had cried and prayed for its existence.</p>
<p>Li Qiye shouted while looking at the heavens’ punishment: “Let’s get started!”</p>
<p>“Roar!” The peacock swallowed all of the treasure water in the pond and disappeared from sight. Next, the Peacock Tree emerged before everyone again. It was still rooted in the earth.</p>
<p>At this time, a green light gushed out from its body. Each strand of green light was full of life. A mighty vitality surged like a storm as these bright strands wove together. The endless life force began to be digested and integrated itself into the tree.</p>
<p>“Rumble!” The punishment from the heavens finally descended. A gigantic lightning bolt came crashing down, capable of splitting the Jade Sea into two or even piercing through it completely.</p>
<p>Countless existences in this region fell to the ground due to fear of this tribulation.</p>
<p>However, an incredible matter happened. Both the lightning bolts and thunder waves only managed to come within a few feet of the tree before being stopped. It seemed that the bolts were only this long, that this was the extent of the thunder.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Many people were startled: “The Peacock Treefather is too powerful, even the heavens’ punishment can’t approach him!”</p>
<p>The spectators didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>Eventually, a very ancient forefather noticed a clue and murmured: “It is not that the punishment can’t reach it! There is something protecting it that is untouchable, even by the Heaven’s Will! An impregnable law!”</p>
<p>“What kind of law or item can’t be shaken even by the will of the high heavens?” A junior was very curious.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sneered and coldly uttered towards the heavens’ punishment: “Will of the high heavens! Damned old heavens, don’t forget, there are a few things that even the Heaven’s Will can’t violate. Many things can be destroyed or concealed, but not the truth observed by the world itself!”</p>
<p>“These are the tears of countless mortals, the love and sympathy for all lives! The Heaven’s Will cannot change this! Damned old man, come down yourself if you dare, your will alone cannot change this order!” Li Qiye mockingly laughed at the incapable heavens’ punishment.</p>
<p>However, the constant barrage of the punishment failed to make contact.</p>
<p>“Even the will of the high heavens cannot touch this law, just what the hell is it?” A very ancient ancestor was astounded after seeing this.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and declared: “Very well, my turn!” With that, he opened his fate palace and the pillar of life emerged.</p>
<p>At this time, a branch from the Peacock Tree stretched out and propped behind Li Qiye’s back. Its five-colored light illuminated his body. A tree appeared behind him like a peacock spreading its beautiful tail.</p>
<p>“Boom!” This pillar of life fiercely penetrated the heavens’ punishment.</p>
<p>The tribulation responded by sending more lightning bolts straight at Li Qiye to tear him apart.</p>
<p>However, the five-colored barrier behind him stopped all of the bolts from coming close to him. Even though this barrier was cracked, the Peacock Tree once again exuded its light to make the barrier whole.</p>
<p>This tribulation was aimed at Li Qiye, so it was much weaker compared to the previous one. The Peacock Tree was powerful enough to shield Li Qiye.</p>
<p>The pillar of life was inside the sea of lightning. Runes emerged from it to form a symbol as it spread its dao. This was the Ancient Void Rune. Li Qiye then relied on it to crazily absorb the lightning and thunder of the tribulation until it ran dry.</p>
<p>“This is crazy!” People watching from their mirrors couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
<p>“This brat is insane, he is using the Peacock Tree to help him squeeze out the punishment’s power. Since the start of time, how many people actually dared to seize this power for their own?” An ancestor applauded this bold action.</p>
<p>Everyone was speechless after seeing this. Even though the tree was protecting him from the tribulation, he dared to send his own pillar of life into the punishment itself. Not too many people would dare to take such a risk.</p>
<p>Eventually, the lightning slowly disappeared. The thunder died down since the field up in the sky had been sucked dry by Li Qiye. Thus, the tribulation vanished.</p>
<p>His pillar of life had turned purple. Even though others couldn’t see it, they could still feel its power after absorbing enough from the tribulation. A mighty power was now contained within.</p>
<p>Once the pillar returned, the spring, tree, and cauldron of life all resonated with each other. The new power of the pillar allowed them to benefit as well.</p>
<p>The Life Origination was melting faster inside his spring of life. The augmentation thanks to the tribulation allowed the spring to become strong enough to dissolve this drop.</p>
<p>He recalled his fate palace and sat down at the base of the Peacock Tree. He closed his eyes and began to rest by channeling his energy.</p>
<p>“A great risk bears a great harvest.” An ancestor muttered: “It doesn’t matter whether this human boy is strong or not, he utilized this rare timing to steal the heavens’ punishment, so he’ll enjoy this great benefit for the rest of his life.”</p>
<p>“He is quite lucky to have been protected by the Peacock Tree and allowed to obtain the power of the tribulation.” A descendant of a great power became quite jealous.</p>
<p>“Look, a new branch is forming on the Peacock Tree.” Someone noticed a new development through their heavenly mirror.</p>
<p>Many turned to look as well. Sure enough, on top of the old roots of the Peacock Tree, a new green branch that carried unlimited vitality appeared.</p>
<p>“A successful life replenishment, this is way too heaven-defying.” Even ancestors gasped before this scene: “He has actually revived a nearly withered ancestral tree, this is incredible.”</p>
<p>A dying ancestor enviously spoke: “The Peacock Tree really obtained a rebirth from this. After this, even if it can’t live for another lifetime, it can definitely survive another eight or ten generations, maybe even longer.”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1222: The Frightened World</h4>
<p>Chapter 1222: The Frightened World</p>
<p>As it was shrouded in a green light, the Peacock Tree quickly emitted a mist that covered all of Peacock Land. At this time, even heavenly mirrors couldn’t see through it, so no one knew what was going on inside.</p>
<p>The Jade Sea became silent again, and the same went for the ancestors watching from the distance.</p>
<p>What happened today was too shocking. It could even be said that many didn’t know how to start talking about it.</p>
<p>A blood ceremony of one billion Teeming Fish had incited a heavens’ punishment. Ultimately, the Peacock Tree’s life replenishment was successful. It became one of the most incredible miracles across all the eons.</p>
<p>Even those who witnessed this miracle with their own eyes couldn’t comment on it. Some were very curious about the current state of Peacock Land, but no one dared to step inside, not even to the nearby sea regions.</p>
<p>At least this was the case for now because they didn’t know the Peacock Tree’s attitude towards outsiders. If it was angry, then regardless of how strong one might be, they would only be seeking death. Thus, the only thing to do was to wait until everything returned to normal before going there.</p>
<p>“This was an amazing strategy.” After a while, an ancestor commented: “Who knows how strong Li Qiye’s cultivation is? But this was quite a frightening plan. One would be hard-pressed to top it.”</p>
<p>“But was it really Li Qiye’s strategy?” A big shot was skeptical about this. Many great powers were debating this matter privately.</p>
<p>A sea demon ancestor contemplated before speaking: “Everything was too perfect, there were zero issues. Could a nameless junior actually do something like this? Only an experienced strategist with great vision could pull off something of this caliber.”</p>
<p>Antagonizing the Teeming Fish, the Extreme Yang School, and the Immaculate Expanse before sacrificing all of them… Perhaps his choice of these three factions was made through careful deliberation.</p>
<p>The Teeming Fish was a ferocious tribe and would definitely seek revenge with their full force. What was more important were their sheer numbers. No other race in the Heaven Spirit World was more suitable.</p>
<p>The Extreme Yang School was a hard yang lineage and also had a great formation, the Extreme Yang Cauldron. It was the best type of cauldron for blood refinement. Meanwhile, the Immaculate Expanse was a soft and mild lineage. Their Law Evading Sword Formation was great for tempering the treasure blood.</p>
<p>These three together were mutually beneficial. There couldn’t be such a coincidence, especially when the cauldron and sword formations were taken into account.</p>
<p>Such means didn’t only involve strategy, but also great knowledge as well as the ability to have absolute control of the situation.</p>
<p>Strategy, knowledge, and absolute power were indispensable in this plan. Without any of them, it was impossible to achieve this miracle. Because of this, an ancestor from a treefather’s lineage had to ask: “Can this young junior, who was completely unknown, come up with this type of scheme or have so much insight?”</p>
<p>The other big shots here were quiet while the other ancestors mused the question.</p>
<p>“This great scheme must have been concocted by the Peacock Tree. Only a character like a treefather would be able to come up with this great plan to complete the blood refinement. A mere human junior can’t possibly do such a thing.” After thinking about it, many felt that this great plan wasn’t something a junior could fabricate.</p>
<p>In the entire Heaven Spirit World, no young genius could do so. This was heavily debated by these senior characters. For example, the Profound God-Monarch, the Seashield Prince and the Swiftdao God most likely didn’t have the ability to carry this out.</p>
<p>Thus, they concluded that Li Qiye was only carrying out the strategy of the Peacock Tree. He was a blade used in this situation to carry out the terrifying blood refinement.</p>
<p>However, there was a problem with this train of thought. Many people knew that once a treefather returned to the earth, it was the same as returning to the origin. They would no longer have their own intelligence, no longer be able to communicate with others.</p>
<p>So even if the tree was the one that planned all of this, how did it communicate with Li Qiye?</p>
<p>“There is only one possibility.” A great character from another treefather’s lineage answered: “He must be a controller. Li Qiye is the Peacock Tree’s controller; only controllers are able to communicate with ancestral trees.”</p>
<p>“A tree controller, hmm.” An ancestor murmured: “It is very difficult for a treefather’s lineage to produce a controller. In the legends, even the Golden Isle only had one controller.”</p>
<p>“No matter what, the Peacock Tree has carried out the life replenishment successfully.” The sect master enviously spoke: “Peacock Land has finally been saved.”</p>
<p>Since this land wasn’t destroyed, it remains a treefather’s continent. Anyone or any lineage would covet it. Unfortunately, the land has only accepted humans even till this point. It didn’t grant entrance to the three great races for millions of years, so only humans settled down at Peacock Land.</p>
<p>While others were discussing the great blood refinement, the Void Imperfection Three Schools who had more information was quiet. Compared to the speculating ancestors, they knew who actually did it. However, they didn’t wish to discuss certain matters with others. Or rather, they weren’t willing to share this crucial information with outsiders.</p>
<p>As for someone who was privy to everything, Kong Qinru chose to stay quiet as well by burying this matter deep in her heart. She wouldn’t even disclose it to those closest to her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how to feel about the whole endeavor. Should she be afraid of Li Qiye’s awe-inspiring means or sympathize with the death of a billion Teeming Fish? Perhaps she should be excited about the successful life replenishment…</p>
<p>Prior to this, she understood what Li Qiye wanted to do from his implicative words, but she still made a choice to help carry out the terrible blood refinement.</p>
<p>Like he said, there was no free lunch in this world. There would always be a great price to pay, and it wasn’t something that she or the Exquisite Valley could afford.</p>
<p>Some might say that the Peacock Tree and Li Qiye were too cruel by carrying out the blood ceremony. It was a vicious plundering of life.</p>
<p>Alas, even more were happy. For many cultivators and sects, the disappearance of a billion Teeming Fish carried great significance. It meant that the territories of the seas were freed up. This would be a great and long feast for many marine kingdoms and tribes in the upcoming days!</p>
<p>An expert stated: “Since the start of time, supreme experts have always marched through countless bones, so it is no big deal that the Peacock Tree sacrificed a billion fish for its own life. This is a world of the strong, and the Peacock Tree stands at the top. Even if it devours all of the Teeming Fish, it is completely understandable.”</p>
<p>At this time, the majority believed that this blood ceremony came from the Peacock Tree.</p>
<p>“Well yes, the Jade Sea will be much more peaceful without these Teeming Fish, more resources have been freed up for the other tribes and lineages. They would have been purged already if it wasn’t for their swift reproductive capabilities. Maybe there will be more room for growth out of this.” Many sects were applauding this development, no one even thought that it was too drastic.</p>
<p>In their opinion, these fish were the locusts of the sea. They crazily multiplied and took up too much room. Many sects had been dissatisfied with them, but they couldn’t do anything out of fear of the fish’s great numbers.</p>
<p>Now, they were refined by the Peacock Tree and lost around seventy to eighty percent of their forces. Perhaps in all the corners of the oceans, one would find it difficult to find a lineage unhappy about this development outside of the Teeming Fish themselves.</p>
<p>The truth was that many marine sects and kingdoms had taken swift action to occupy the territories of the Teeming Fish. In just one night, war raged across the oceans as people vied for resources.</p>
<p>Until now, the Teeming Fish had taken too many territories in the marine regions so today, outside of capturing resources, various tribes and lineages also wanted revenge since the Teeming Fish robbed them of it in the past!</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1223: Quiet Aftermath</h4>
<p>Chapter 1223: Quiet Aftermath</p>
<p>Peacock Land was still very quiet. The day came and went with no one daring to enter. They were afraid of the Peacock Tree’s wrath and another terrible blood refinement.</p>
<p>Li Qiye also enjoyed the calm and peace during this period of time.</p>
<p>In fact, many people had shifted their attention to the wars for territories and resources. The majority of the sects and kingdoms were busy waging battles in the Teeming Fish’s marine regions. They didn’t have the time or energy to enter Peacock Land. At the same time, the Teeming Fish became a dog with a dead owner overnight; they were ganged up on by almost everyone.</p>
<p>The breeze gently blew under the Peacock Tree. At this time, it looked completely different with verdant leaves. It emitted an exuberant aura after the replenishment. It was clear that it would be able to live for a long time.</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s harvest was quite sizable as well. He was able to devour the heavens’ punishment, giving him the ability to solve the problem of the Life Origination.</p>
<p>He was quite content with his gains since he was only missing one out of the four mysteries of the fate palace. Currently in his possession were the Ancient Void Rune, the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter, and the Life Origination. If he could gather the final piece, it would be nearly complete for him.</p>
<p>He eventually opened his eyes after a while, feeling quite comfortable with a strange sensation due to the great vitality, similar to a rebirth. While glancing around, he noticed an exquisite jade table in front of him and a stove with smoke curling out of it.</p>
<p>There was also the sound of burning wood. On top of the table was boiling spring water at just the right temperature. The water was heated right when he woke up.</p>
<p>A pair of gentle porcelain hands were preparing tea with a pot and cup. All the movements were quite smooth and natural, showing great mastery.</p>
<p>Li Qiye took note of the master of these hands. It was a charming beauty. Even though she was still a maiden, she already had the sexiness of a mature woman like a ripe peach that others couldn’t help but want a taste of.</p>
<p>Who could it be besides the schoolmaster of the Sacred Spring School, Zhuo Jianshi?</p>
<p>She sat in a proper position while pouring tea for Li Qiye. This gentle and docile demeanor made her look like a newlywed bride.</p>
<p>He only smiled and took the jade cup, taking his time to sip the tea without saying anything.</p>
<p>After he finished, she poured another cup for him with the same grace. At this time, Kong Qinru appeared on the peak and stood there quietly.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi noticed her arrival and put down the teapot then quietly left. She didn’t say a word from start to finish.</p>
<p>Kong Qinru came forward and kneeled before Li Qiye. Being the valley lord didn’t diminish the respect she showed him.</p>
<p>She looked at him and said: “Young Noble, I’m afraid I have to go back. The sect has summoned me.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and replied: “Go, a feast is about to begin. Many lands have lost their master with continuous wars being waged. The Exquisite Valley requires you to preside over these matters, so of course you will have to leave.”</p>
<p>She added: “If there is more news about the person you are trying to find, the valley will let you know right away.”</p>
<p>He only nodded without saying anything else.</p>
<p>Eventually, she asked: “When will we meet again?” She knew that he was only passing through the Heaven Spirit World. There was nothing here that could make him feel sentimental.</p>
<p>“We will meet again if it is meant to be.” He smiled: “You have a great ambition, a drive for change. Keep on trying, one can only be successful through perseverance. Dreams alone will not accomplish anything.”</p>
<p>She responded in all seriousness: “I will engrave your guidance in my heart.”</p>
<p>He nodded again and continued to drink his tea. The steam coming out from the cup seemed to be covering his face, causing Kong Qinru to stare at him in a daze. It was as if he was hiding in the mist; no one could see through his unfathomable self.</p>
<p>Eventually, he looked at her and asked: “Anything else?”</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment before answering: “Schoolmaster Zhuo is quite exceptional. The Sacred Spring School was initially in a marriage pact with our Exquisite Valley. The schoolmaster’s fiancee was my first brother. Unfortunately, he died from misfortune before the two of them could marry. Schoolmaster Zhuo has been living as a widow for his sake. This can only be praised as having great loyalty and virtue…”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh before shaking his head: “Are you trying to find a wife or a concubine for me? Or perhaps a bedwarming maid?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare.” She said in a serious manner: “I was only afraid that you might have misunderstood.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “Don’t worry, nothing can elude my gaze or trick my mind.”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and respectfully bade farewell: “Young Noble, I hope that we can meet again. I will not let you down in the future.”</p>
<p>With that, she drifted away and disappeared.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked down to continue drinking his tea. After a good while, Zhuo Jianshi eventually returned to the side. She poured more tea for him in the same natural manner.</p>
<p>Inside the tea’s mist, he looked at her and leisurely smiled: “Is this your own will, or is it the hope of the old geezers from your three schools?”</p>
<p>She only quietly sat there. It seemed that she would always be incredibly elegant and mature. This kind of noble grace made her even more attractive.</p>
<p>“If I can follow Young Noble, it will be our three schools’ honor.” Her soft voice was especially pleasant.</p>
<p>He smiled and said: “What do you want? Or rather, what does your Sacred Spring School want? A whale rider or an imperial seed?”</p>
<p>She pondered for a bit before softly answering: “Young Noble, what are you willing to give us?”</p>
<p>He leisurely responded: “I don’t need to leave behind anything for your three schools. In fact, I don’t owe you anything, it is the other way around.”</p>
<p>The truth was that Li Qiye simply didn’t want to care about these matters in this generation. Even though he was friends with Immortal Emperor Wu Gou, he didn’t need to protect the Void Imperfect Three Schools and definitely didn’t need to leave anything behind for them.</p>
<p>After hearing this, she gently sighed with a slight frown on her beautiful face. Even this expression had its own charm. Others couldn’t help but want to make her happy again.</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued to sip on his tea. In his eyes, all of this was as ephemeral as the wind and clouds.</p>
<p>Eventually, he suggested: “If, say, I want you to warm my bed since the only thing I want from your school is you, will you agree?”</p>
<p>She contemplated for a bit before looking straight at him while giving a sincere response: “Young Noble, if you fancy me, it would be my honor.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and shook his head: “I am not someone who likes to force others.”</p>
<p>“She might be unwilling, but I’m not.” A coquettish voice came about at this time: “I want to follow you and stay by your side, Young Noble!”</p>
<p>This voice was particularly enchanting and could steal someone’s soul away. Just by hearing it, one would imagine that it was a very charming woman.</p>
<p>A woman fluttered closer with the wind. Before even seeing her appearance, one would already be enraptured by her. Each of her steps was quite graceful, like a willow leaf amidst the breeze. Her ethereal bearing would draw countless uncontrollable gazes.</p>
<p>She stood before Li Qiye while dressed in a black robe that couldn’t hide her peerlessly beautiful posture. Her willow-like waist was apparent through the thin, silky cloth. Her bottom half had perfectly round buttocks that were accentuated even more by the black cotton yarn.</p>
<p>A dark gossamer top hid her well-rounded breasts, very few brushes could capture their soul-stirring gorgeousness. It was indeed a difficult endeavor to describe them with words.</p>
<p>In particular, they would sway in an astonishing manner with each of her steps. This was truly not for the faint of heart. She came before Li Qiye and deeply bowed: “My name is Liu Ruyan, nice to meet you, Young Noble.”</p>
<p>She was very close to him. An intoxicatingly pleasant smell was carried by the wind. In this close proximity, one would suddenly have the illusion that they were embracing her while basking in her delightful fragrance.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1224: Liu Ruyan</h4>
<p>Chapter 1224: Liu Ruyan</p>
<p>The woman ahead had her face hidden behind a black veil. Regardless, just by looking at her graceful and slender figure that was accentuated by magnificent curves on top of her barely visible valley was more than enough to fill the heart with euphoria.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi slightly frowned while sitting at the table after seeing this woman. However, she still maintained her elegance and calmness before speaking: “Little Sister Liu, do the elders know that you are here?”</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan let out a charming smile capable of inciting lust. She didn’t mind Zhuo Jianshi’s question: “Who among the elders doesn’t know that I love to interfere with your business? It wouldn’t be good if they knew I was here.”</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi had expected this answer, so what else could she say?</p>
<p>Li Qiye was still hidden behind the curling steam rising from his teacup as he looked at her and chuckled: “The descendants of the Liu Clan are all femme fatales. It looks like you have also inherited your ancestors’ bewitching abilities. This is indeed a great disaster for all living beings. Moreover, it looks like your Evil Devourer Graceful Law is not bad either. Your clan is a bit interesting to have this variation of the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique.” [1]</p>
<p>“Young Noble, you speak as if only our Liu Clan specializes in seduction. Many people in the Heaven Spirit World call the women of our clan vixens.” She chuckled while staring at him in a bold and direct fashion. [2]</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed after hearing this: “Well, the women from your clan are indeed vixens, including your progenitor. Even though people say that she was a grand completion Immortal Physique user, she couldn’t complete the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique and instead ended up with this type of seductive physique. She was a beautiful temptress of the nine worlds that drove countless men crazy.”</p>
<p>“I am honored to hear such praise from you, Young Noble.” She covered her mouth while laughing. Despite being covered by a veil, her eyes could pass on amorous feelings. When she stared at Li Qiye, they were luminous with autumn ripples. [3]</p>
<p>Li Qiye shook his head and smiled: “Girl, there is still a long way to go if you want to seduce me. Try again after you reach grand completion with your physique. With the skill you have right now, you are only embarrassing yourself.”</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan wasn’t offended at all. She gave a charming smile and said: “Since you say so, when I reach grand completion, I’ll try to see if I can get you into my red curtains.” [4]</p>
<p>“Take me into your red curtains?” Li Qiye was quite amused: “You can almost qualify to be mine alone, but for me to marry you... Don’t dwell on this idea.”</p>
<p>“So you are saying that I still have a chance?” She flirted with a seductive chuckle. It was just as Li Qiye had said, this woman was definitely a vixen.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi was still calmly sitting nearby despite Liu Ruyan’s flirtatious behavior. Her mature and elegant charm would make others palpitate in a different manner.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled back at Liu Ruyan. He looked over at Zhuo Jianshi and asked: “Who is in charge of the Void Imperfection Three Schools right now?”</p>
<p>So it turned out that Liu Ruyan was the current schoolmaster of the Evil Devourer School. However, the Evil Devourer School and the Sacred Spring School had a very interesting relationship due to the intricate relationship between their two physique laws.</p>
<p>The physique law of the Sacred Spring School was the Surging Golden Spring Law while the Evil Devourer School’s law was the Evil Devourer Graceful Law. One cultivated into the Sacred Spring Physique while the other the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique.</p>
<p>The schools had three Immortal Physique laws. In addition to the two previously mentioned, the third was the Void Imperfection Physique Law.</p>
<p>Originally, these three should have nothing to do with each other. The Void Imperfection Physique was from the word “Pure” in the Physique Scripture. The Sacred Spring Physique originated from the word “Soft” while the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique came from the word “Yin”.</p>
<p>However, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou couldn’t obtain the Physique Scripture, thus his physique law was taught to him by a predecessor. In the end, he created the Void Imperfection Windchase Law.</p>
<p>This physique law created by the emperor was naturally weaker than the one in the scripture. Because of this, it also included some other things.</p>
<p>Inside this Windchase Physique Law were essences of pureness and softness. From this, future descendants had different interpretations. During the era of the Sacred Spring School’s progenitor, this person was able to understand the mysteries of the Windchase Law’s softness to create the Surging Golden Spring Law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because pureness originated from softness, it meant that softness also carried the Yin affinity. [5]</p>
<p>In order to make this Immortal Physique law even purer to avoid qi deviation during cultivation, the Sacred Spring Progenitor forcefully changed this physique law and removed the softness within the Yin affinity.</p>
<p>It was precisely this need for constant correction in order to successfully train the Surging Golden Spring Law that gave birth to the Evil Devourer Graceful Law later on.</p>
<p>It started with a female disciple. She was a femme fatale level beauty with a rebellious nature. She looked down on this correction, so she chose to go in the opposite direction of the Surging Golden Spring Law.</p>
<p>Her aptitude was very scary. Her reverse derivation of the Immortal Physique law had even surpassed her predecessors. She understood the word Yin and created the Evil Devourer Graceful Law.</p>
<p>Because the graceful law was derived from the golden spring law, the future Sacred Spring and Evil Devourer Schools would often mess with each other.</p>
<p>The Sacred Spring School believed that the graceful law came from the surging spring law, so their law was stronger. On the other hand, the Evil Devourer School believed that their graceful law was the result of surpassing the limit of the surging spring law, so their law could replace the former.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no result to this competition because the two schools had never produced another person that could reach grand completion, let alone one for each physique at the same time.</p>
<p>However, they saw hope in this generation with Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan. They were both extremely talented and cultivated their respective physique laws. The Void Imperfection Three Schools felt that they could finally see two grand completion Immortal Physique users in this generation. If this was the case, then the Sacred Spring School and Evil Devourer School could have a chance to see which was stronger.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the two girls were only ordinary disciples, they often clashed. And the competition didn’t end after they became schoolmasters. Whenever they were together, a fight would surely break out.</p>
<p>One could say that this was their fate, the reason for their continuous struggle until their final showdown at grand completion. Of course, it was not a life and death fight for these two. After all, they were still sisters from the same sect.</p>
<p>She revealed a lovable smile and said: “Though Sister Zhuo is older than me by half a generation, if we are talking about the leader of the Void Imperfection Three Schools, then it can’t be anyone but me.”</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi calmly answered: “The current leader of the three schools is First Brother.”</p>
<p>The First Brother Zhuo Jianshi mentioned was the schoolmaster of the Void Imperfection branch because he was the oldest in their generation and had joined the sect the earliest. In the school, many of the disciples had been taught by him before. Thus, he was not only their First Brother, but also their master of sorts.</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan chuckled in response: “Sister Zhuo, First Brother has been talking about stepping down so the role will fall onto one of our shoulders in the future, but I feel that I am much more suitable than you.”</p>
<p>Her claim was not because she wanted to seize power and take control of the Void Imperfection Three Schools, it was because the two of them had grown accustomed to competing with each other since the early days. It was not a good thing for the two to meet since it would always end with either Zhuo Jianshi challenging Liu Ruyan or the other way around.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi sat there, neither supporting nor retorting to Liu Ruyan’s claim. Her demure and mature aura were truly special.</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked after finishing another cup: “What are you here for?” Zhuo Jianshi poured another cup for him, as if this had always been the case.</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan smiled coquettishly in response: “To steal Sister Zhuo’s man. I heard the ancestors have high hopes for her and I feel that I am not lesser in any way, so why can’t I vie for her lover as well?”</p>
<p>Such provocative words were let out in an incredibly trivial manner. Liu Ruyan had no semblance of a bashful girl.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Li Qiye looked at her and smilingly replied: “That’s not necessarily the case. Perhaps I prefer gentle and virtuous women.”</p>
<p>“I have never claimed otherwise.” Liu Ruyan sat down next to him with a soul-stealing allurement: “These are two different matters. Young Noble, you can like virtuous women and still have a taste for a seductive beauty. These two things aren’t mutually exclusive, right?”</p>
<p>“A little interesting, you are indeed a descendant of the Liu Clan.” Li Qiye was not shaken by her bewitching. [6]</p>

<h4>Chapter 1225: Three Women Competing For One Groom</h4>
<p>Chapter 1225: Three Women Competing For One Groom</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at her and said: “Who knows, maybe I am a little eccentric, wanting only what I can't have and have a distaste for things that come too easily.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem either.” Liu Ruyan smiled back: “Many things can slowly change. As long as you stay with me, you will come to find that I will not disappoint you. Maybe you will like me then.”</p>
<p>“Possible.” Li Qiye had an amused glimmer in his eyes as he stared at her: “But maybe I am someone who has a penchant for someone else’s wife. A little girl like you is not attractive to me.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble, are you saying that you wish to embrace both me and Sister Zhuo and take your time savoring us?” Liu Ruyan winked seductively and smiled: “That’s perfect, I will help you. Maybe I can even train Sister Zhuo to be more sexy and obedient in her service.”</p>
<p>She spoke in an incredibly natural manner with a touch of naughtiness that added to her charm.</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and gently shook his head: “If your Void Imperfection Three Schools wants to use the honey trap against me, I can only say that your geezers really don’t understand me.”</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan faintly smiled in response: “I don’t know whether the ancestors told Sister Zhuo to tempt Young Noble or not, but I definitely didn’t receive this order. Of course, if she wants you to stay at the Sacred Spring School, then I must win you over.”</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi frowned after hearing this. She replied: “Sister Liu, this is not a personal issue between us two. If you want to invite Young Noble to the Evil Devourer School as a guest, then I wouldn’t object and would even be excited for you. If he is willing to stay at our three schools because of you, then you would become a great contributor to our school.”</p>
<p>“Sister Zhuo, you are mistaken.” Liu Ruyan shook her head: “I don’t care about becoming a great contributor, I simply want to steal your man. I still can’t understand why you always listen to those old geezers’ arrangements for the sake of the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Do you really think you can sacrifice everything for this goal?”</p>
<p>She continued on: “For me, my path is below my feet. Each person should walk their own path. If Sister wants to keep him behind out of your own volition, then I am fine with it, but if it is for the Void Imperfection Three Schools, then I will definitely take him from you.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye continued to drink his tea in a carefree manner as if this had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>After saying her piece, she looked at Li Qiye and playfully winked: “Are you not angry at what I said, Young Noble?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and continued to drink his tea.</p>
<p>“Bah, two shameless vixens daring to seduce my husband?!” At this time, a fiery shout rang from the distance.</p>
<p>A woman came from the sky. No, to be more accurate, it was a little girl with flowers blooming from each of her steps.</p>
<p>She came barefoot on these fresh flowers like a descending goddess.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked over and smilingly shook his head after seeing the girl.</p>
<p>“Hey! Does your Void Imperfection Three Schools have no shame? You are schoolmasters yet you two are trying to seduce my husband, how shameful.” Ye Xiaoxiao stepped under the Peacock Tree with both hands posturing on her thin waist, glaring at Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
<p>“Oh? Little Sister, you are too young to be this anxious for marriage.” Liu Ruyan chuckled: “Trying to find a husband at this young age is a little shameful, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Ye Xiaoxiao maintained her powerful glare: “Who is being shameless here? Hmph, you are trying to seduce someone else’s husband in broad daylight, you are the ones throwing your face away!”</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi shook her head after seeing the fierce girl and answered gracefully: “Princess Ye, you are mistaken. You have yet to marry Young Noble Li, so you can’t claim that he is your husband. I’m afraid this is your one-sided belief.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.” Liu Ruyan chuckled provocatively: “Little Sister, he would be your husband once you two are married. You must be too little to understand this.”</p>
<p>“Your head is little!” Ye Xiaoxiao quickly retorted: You dare to steal my husband? I’m going to teach you a lesson.”</p>
<p>This girl had no qualms at all and casually prepared to attack. With a buzz, a wooden sword appeared.</p>
<p>This wooden sword seemed to be made from thousands of divine swords as its sword energy was absolutely frightening. With a clank, countless swords slashed vertically towards Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you really attacking?” Liu Ruyan smiled and reached forward. Her fingers turned into a phoenix that soared towards the numerous divine slashes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhuo Jianshi remained seated there, proud and completely fearless. She simply waved her sleeve and swept away Ye Xiaoxiao’s wave of swords.</p>
<p>“Hmph! Think I’m afraid? Even if you two come together, I’ll still beat you down into submission!” Ye Xiaoxiao shouted and waved her hand. Divine trees materialized and formed a formation to trap the other two women.</p>
<p>After seeing Ye Xiaoxiao becoming serious, both Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi didn’t want to underestimate their opponent. They stood up at the same time before roaring as they leapt towards the trees.</p>
<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” With both of them attacking, Ye Xiaoxiao was definitely at a disadvantage. After all, they were older than her and they both trained in Immortal Physiques so they were no joke.</p>
<p>Xiaoxiao was still young so it wasn’t easy for her to go one-on-two. Her divine trees couldn’t entrap these two.</p>
<p>“Sister Zhuo, if the two of us pick on Little Sister Ye, people will laugh at us.” Liu Ruyan smiled: “You do you, I won’t fight together with you.”</p>
<p>With that, she pointed her sword at Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi was no slouch either despite her graceful bearing. As a schoolmaster, there were times when she needed to be aggressive as well. Thus, she unleashed a divine seal and said: “I also want to see if you have improved recently!”</p>
<p>“I’m going to teach both of you a lesson!” Ye Xiaoxiao didn’t show any weakness. She summoned a huge vine that turned into a giant that joined her in fighting the other women.</p>
<p>The dueling ladies shouted at the same time and retaliated against the gigantic vine.</p>
<p>Very shortly, the fight became a brawl with no one giving an inch. The fight rushed into the sky.</p>
<p>“Not bad, not bad at all.” Li Qiye clapped while watching this duel.</p>
<p>The three neither held back nor did they care for his praise. Even the vault of the sky was being shattered by their attacks.</p>
<p>They could be described as kingdom-toppling beauties. When they really went at it, it was a very beautiful sight to behold.</p>
<p>“Aizz, three supreme beauties fighting so viciously for a man. This man is too blessed.” A groan came about.</p>
<p>A wooden boat landed on Peacock Peak. It didn’t matter whether it was land or sea, the boat could easily travel through all terrain.</p>
<p>A young man with a dashing appearance was sitting in this boat. He wore an ivory-colored robe and was in great spirits. There was a hint of maturity in his demeanor as well.</p>
<p>He watched the three women fighting in the sky and enviously told Li Qiye: “When will I become as lucky as you, Brother? To be able to make the Sacred Spring Schoolmaster, the Evil Devourer Schoolmaster and the little princess of the Golden Isle fight each other... such romantic luck is truly enviable.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled in response and continued to watch the fight.</p>
<p>“This little brother is Buzhan Feng.” The youth cupped his fists and smiled at Li Qiye: “In my opinion, the three ladies won’t be able to come to a conclusion anytime soon. Will you give me the honor of having a drink together?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the youth and smiled back before taking one last glance at the girls. Then, he stepped onto the boat and sat down.</p>
<p>“Go.” Buzhan Feng laughed and said: “Brother Li, sit tight.”</p>
<p>He then grabbed the paddle and began to row it as if through water.</p>
<p>“Swoosh!” This wooden boat traveled at frightening speeds. It immediately shattered space and this sea region. All of a sudden, they were in the middle of a vast ocean.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat there without asking Buzhan Feng about their destination. He simply enjoyed the scenic views along the way.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng was rowing his boat and looked at Li Qiye before sincerely stating: “I am full of admiration for Brother Li’s intelligence. It seems that nothing in this world can shake your dao heart.”</p>
<p>“You are not bad as well.” Li Qiye lightly grinned: “To be able to cultivate the Buzhan Clan’s martial arts to this level truly demonstrates your firm dao heart.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1226: Buzhan Feng</h4>
<p>Chapter 1226: Buzhan Feng</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng sighed after Li Qiye revealed his identity: “Brother Li is indeed a tree controller, you were able to see through me right away. For millions of years, those who have earned the favor of the ancestral trees have always been part of the most magnificent crowd. Today, you are no lesser than any of the old sages.”</p>
<p>So it turned out that Buzhan Feng was from the Buzhan Clan, the descendants of Immortal Emperor Buzhan. Outside of the Heaven Spirit World, the uninformed thought that the emperor was the one who founded this clan, but this was not the case. [1. Buzhan = Warmarch or stage of war.]</p>
<p>A very long time ago, before Immortal Emperor Buzhan came to be, the clan was already an ancient lineage with the surname Buzhan. Some even thought that this clan was older than Gu Chun’s four branches.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t the oldest clan in the Heaven Spirit World, there would be very few older than it.</p>
<p>As the successor of this clan, Buzhan Feng was quite powerful. However, just like his clan, he was not very famous in this world when compared to the top geniuses like the Swiftdao God, the Seashield Prince and the Seven Seas Goddess. He was even less renowned than the Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin due to his penchant for keeping a low profile.</p>
<p>Of course, the clan itself was very low-key. Outside of Immortal Emperor Buzhan’s generation, the clan had always acted in this manner. Some people guessed that this had something to do with their origin.</p>
<p>The Void Imperfection Three Schools rarely appeared as well. Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan maintained low profiles, albeit in a different manner from Buzhan Feng.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the three schools had a pragmatic reason for doing so while the two women had this type of personality. At the same time, the three schools didn’t vie for reputation or prestige. However, if there was something that was beneficial for the schools in question, they would definitely pursue it.</p>
<p>The Buzhan Clan was much more extreme in this regard. Their disciples rarely showed themselves in this world. Moreover, they had no interest in worldly affairs.</p>
<p>Many believed that the Buzhan Clan was doing this to preserve their strength. Others also thought that there were circumstances that forced them to be like this.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled at the praise. Many people had mistaken him for a tree controller and thought that he was the lucky guy chosen by the Peacock Tree. However, he didn’t care too much about this misperception.</p>
<p>The wooden boat rushed forward at breakneck speeds before landing on an island. The waves were quite lively here. One island after another covered this region like jewels on the sea. It was a particularly beautiful scene.</p>
<p>There were oceans everywhere in this world, but not just anyone could claim the islands as their private property. The Buzhan Clan’s main base was located at the Abyss Sea, but they still had properties in the Jade Sea. From this, one could see just how influential they were.</p>
<p>The youth took Li Qiye into a courtyard with artificial lakes and bubbling springs. This place had a feminine aura, so it was easy to tell that the owner of this house was a woman.</p>
<p>There was a little island on the artificial lake with water flowing under the connecting bridge. The dripping water created a very pleasant beat.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked further and saw a woman sitting in a pavilion at the top of this island. Her back was facing them as her jade-white fingers plucked the strings of her zither. A transcendent sound was created by her wondrous skill.</p>
<p>Even though he couldn’t see her face, it was clear from her slim and graceful back that she must be quite a looker with no room for criticism.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, let me introduce my big sister to you.” Buzhan Feng smiled and said: “Even though she rarely shows herself, I can guarantee that she is the prettiest girl in the Abyss Sea.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and said: “Don’t tell me you are trying to find a husband for your older sis, or perhaps a stallion? If that’s the case, forget about it.”</p>
<p>“Brother Li, you can’t put it that way. Everything is up to the word ‘fate’.” The youth smiled back before raising his voice at the girl on the island: “Sister, let me introduce a friend to you. This is Brother Li, an exceptional contemporary genius. He is the guardian of the human race, the successor of Peacock Land, and one who has been personally taught by the treefather. One would be hard-pressed to find his match in the entire world.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he heard Buzhan Feng brag about him. Since when did he become the guardian of the human race and the successor of Peacock Land?</p>
<p>At this time, the woman stopped playing her zither. She didn’t turn her head and only said: “Little Feng, your friend is my friend so I welcome him here, but if you want to be the same as Father by trying to find an imperial bloodline to pass on our line, then sorry, excuse my lack of reception.” Without a doubt, the big sister knew just what her brother was up to.</p>
<p>“Sis, you can’t put it like that. Brother Li is incomparably outstanding.” He didn’t give up and continued his boastful spiel: “He came from a distinguished family while still being humble and dignified. In my eyes, the Seashield Prince’s group can’t compare to him.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Forget about this. If you are still interested, let’s have a drink.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng couldn’t do anything else but catch up to Li Qiye. Nevertheless, he still looked back at his sister and shouted: “Sis, think about it, maybe you two will fall in love at first sight…”</p>
<p>His sister ignored his nonsense and quietly played her zither. The melodious song began to play again.</p>
<p>Although Buzhan Feng failed the introduction, he still entertained Li Qiye very well. In his own pavilion, he took out the hidden wine that he had been fermenting for Li Qiye to drink.</p>
<p>After carefully tasting the wine from the clan, Li Qiye put down the cup and nodded his head: “The old wine from your clan is indeed worthy of its fame.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng laughed and said: “My wines are not considered high quality at all. The ones from the ancestors back home are the best of the best. If you want, you can come have a taste at our clan.”</p>
<p>He poured another cup for Li Qiye after saying this.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “If your clan is trying to find a groom or whatever, I’ll have to pass since I have zero interest in this kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“Brother Li, you can’t be so sure about that. My sis is the number one beauty of the Abyss Sea, she’s definitely not inferior in the slightest compared to the Exquisite Valley Master. Plus, I’m not one to brag, but she is beyond virtuous. In this regard, she does not lose to Schoolmaster Zhuo, and in terms of beauty, she is a match for Schoolmaster Liu as well…”</p>
<p>“... So, if you two stay together for a bit, maybe you will be attracted to each other and become something more.” He was trying his best to sell his sister.</p>
<p>Li Qiye leisurely drank the wine and chuckled: “This is our first meeting yet you are introducing your sister to me already. Are you not afraid of pushing your sister into a fire pit?”</p>
<p>“I’m not worried at all.” The youth smiled back: “What kind of people are the geezers from the Void Imperfection Three Schools? They’re as crafty as ghosts and sly like foxes, and they want nothing more than to marry Schoolmaster Zhuo to you. The old men from the Golden Isle also want you for their groom. Since you are such a hot commodity, I can represent my sister and hook you two up without any apprehension.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and shook his head since he didn’t want to dwell on this topic: “Forget the matter of grooms. However, if there is a chance, I do want to visit the Buzhan Clan to see the ancient scrolls left behind by your ancestors.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng hurriedly replied: “Brother Li, you are indeed special with extraordinary vision, ordinary people can’t compare to you. They only want to see treasures and technique manuals at our clan, but you want to read the ancient books.”</p>
<p>He smiled and continued: “It is no big deal if you want to read our books, just marry my big sis, then we’ll be family. With my sis asking the ancestors asking in your stead, it will be very simple. You probably don’t know, but my big sis is their favorite. The ancestors dote on her more than me, the successor.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye helplessly waved his sleeve at Buzhan Feng who was not giving up on trying to sell his sister: “Don’t mention this again. I have zero interest.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Buzhan Feng had to drop it and smiled: “Then I won’t bring it up again, but I’m still confident that there is a lot of time left. There is still a chance for the two of you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye had to smile back since he understood that the Charming Spirit Race had always been interested in the procreation of their race and stallions.</p>
<p>In fact, he wasn’t the only one lacking interest in this matter. Buzhan Feng’s older sister opposed this matter as well.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1227: Origin Of The Buzhan Clan</h4>
<p>Chapter 1227: Origin Of The Buzhan Clan</p>
<p>The two continued to drink their fine wine. Even though Buzhan Feng came from an ancient clan, he was still very amiable and humorous to the point where others would hesitate to end the party.</p>
<p>After another round, Buzhan Feng put down his cup and said: “Brother Li, this might be intrusive so I don’t know if I should ask or not.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nonchalantly said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng stated in a serious manner: “In my humble opinion, Brother Li must not be from the Heaven Spirit World. Of course, if you don’t want to talk about it, we’ll just pretend that I didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye took another sip and casually asked: “What makes you say that?”</p>
<p>“Brother Li, you are a hero in the contemporary, a dragon that will soar to the nine heavens, destined to be a prominent Godking.” The youth smilingly answered: “In my opinion, you didn’t debut just now, and yet you are completely unknown in the Heaven Spirit World. Thus, I believe that you are not from here.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled and glanced at the youth: “It is no secret. You are right, I am from the Mortal Emperor World.”</p>
<p>“Just as I thought!” He patted his thigh triumphantly: “I must be eighty to ninety percent right then.”</p>
<p>“It looks like you have more to say.” Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and smirked at the boy: “And here I thought you only wanted to introduce your sister to me.”</p>
<p>“No, no, Brother Li, don’t misunderstand.” Buzhan Feng bowed to apologize with great sincerity: “I really did ask you to come here so that I could introduce my big sis to you, but at the same time, I also wanted to ask a few questions.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye slowly took another sip. After a good while, he said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“This little brother wants to ask you about the great vortex.” Buzhan Feng hurriedly replied: “Please teach me.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly said while squinting his eyes: “It looks like you know a lot.”</p>
<p>“No, of course not, this is pure speculation. Your appearance is too coincidental and was right around the time of the fluctuation from the vortex. Therefore, I came up with a bold guess, you must have gone there.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked slowly: “Do you have some intentions towards the vortex?”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng took a deep breath and earnestly spoke: “I won’t hide it from you. Brother Li, I am very concerned about the vortex. As the successor of the Buzhan Clan, this is also my responsibility. Perhaps you don’t know about the origin of our clan, but I can let you know that there is a reason why we are here at the Heaven Spirit World. We are more closely connected to the vortex than any other lineage.”</p>
<p>“I know a bit about this matter.” Li Qiye calmly revealed: “Your clan has always been linked to the vortex. Outsiders do not know the reason why, but the answer to this question traces back to the origin of your clan.”</p>
<p>“You know?” Buzhan Feng was surprised because outsiders shouldn’t know about this. Even some disciples in the clan were unaware. As the successor, he was privy to more information than his peers. Nevertheless, he still didn’t know the secrets behind this relationship.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many things that I don’t know.” Li Qiye leisurely said: “If your clan can understand your own beginning, then it will come to understand its relationship with the vortex. Moreover, it will also clear up the origin of your Charming Spirit Race.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sipped his wine and leisurely said: “In other words, if your Buzhan Clan’s genealogy was a historical script, then it would be one about the history of the charming spirits. If there are blank spots in this race’s history itself, then there will be answers within your clan. However, that is based on the premise that you can figure out your own origin first.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s words shocked Buzhan Feng. He stared at Li Qiye in astonishment and murmured: “Brother Li, you know much more than I expected. To have such insight... It seems that I’m inferior in this aspect.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. When you go to many places, you will learn many things.” Li Qiye put down his cup again.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng quickly refilled Li Qiye’s cup and continued the conversation in earnest: “The truth is that I’m confused about many things as well. All of it seems to be hidden in a fog throughout history. So please, guide me out of this maze.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and answered: “There’s not much I can teach you. If you think I came this time for the vortex, then that would be wrong. I just happened to be passing by and played around a bit."</p>
<p>After a while, he went on: “If you want to ask me about what is at the bottom of the vortex, if there are things that relate to your clan or the charming spirits, then my answer is that I can’t tell you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye plainly explained: “The things there are also related to the origin of the sea demons and the final destination of the treants. Just like the sea demons at the Bonesea and the Divine Tree Ridge for the treants, outsiders can’t explain it to you. A true answer has to be figured out on your own.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng murmured to himself: “The Bonesea and Divine Tree Ridge for those two races...”</p>
<p>Eventually, he looked up over at Li Qiye and speculated out loud: “Are you saying that our origin is similar to the sea demons and treants?”</p>
<p>“No, you are off in this case.” Li Qiye smiled: “Why is it that you charming spirits are considered the favored children of the heavens instead of the sea demons or treants? Why is it that sea demons don’t want to leave this world and the treants will always return no matter what? There are many similarities, but the real reason, the true answers, are completely different.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng began to ponder while murmuring: “I think I’m seeing something here. When treants die, they begin the process of atavism and take root in the earth. For generations, the sea gods also have to be accepted by the Trident. Only with it would they be qualified to fight Immortal Emperors.”</p>
<p>This issue had been repeatedly explored for many generations. Why did treants have to return to the Heaven Spirit World? Some said that even if they went to other places, they would come back to this world to die. Only by dying here would they be returning to their roots.</p>
<p>As for the sea demons, everyone could understand that no other places in the nine worlds were more suitable than the Heaven Spirit World. After all, the entire place was practically a vast ocean. Where would they rather go than here?</p>
<p>However, something that was quite peculiar to many researchers was why sea demons didn’t become Immortal Emperors and instead became sea gods. Another interesting thing was their most powerful artifact, one that could even suppress Immortal Emperors — the Trident.</p>
<p>What was the secret behind the Trident? Where did this powerful weapon come from?</p>
<p>Li Qiye stared at the absent-minded boy and said: “If a real answer is what you seek, then you must go to the vortex; it can give you the answer. Of course, you must get through it alive first.”</p>
<p>“Go to the vortex?” Buzhan Feng took a deep breath and smiled wryly before shaking his head: “I’m a very confident person, but I know I am not qualified to go to the vortex. That is beyond my abilities. Even if there are answers there, I would be torn asunder before reaching its end. If even Godkings can’t do it, there’s no way I could.”</p>
<p>“If I remember correctly, your forefather, Immortal Emperor Buzhan, went there in the past.” Li Qiye smiled and slowly uttered: “He is one of the few Immortal Emperors that was obsessed with the vortex, much more so than the other emperors.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng was silent for a bit before eventually answering: “I heard the ancestors say that our forefather really did go in there. According to legend, he actually made it to the bottom.”</p>
<p>Here, the youth helplessly shrugged before continuing: “But when His Venerableness came back from the vortex, he rarely talked about this matter. Nothing was said about what he saw down there, so our clan doesn’t know much about the bottom of the vortex.”</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly difficult to find out more.” Li Qiye drank another cup: “If I am not mistaken, your emperor left behind two top-secret imperial edicts. Open the second one and perhaps you can get some answers.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?!” Buzhan Feng was frightened after hearing Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Like I said, there are very few things that I don’t know. “ Li Qiye nonchalantly stated: “Normally, Immortal Emperors would leave behind one imperial edict. If an emperor leaves behind two, then the second one would entail a heaven-shattering matter relating to an eternal secret. It is not something the world should find out so easily, only real experts that have reached a certain level are qualified to learn it!”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1228: Imperial Edict</h4>
<p>Chapter 1228: Imperial Edict</p>
<p>“How do you know so much…?” Buzhan Feng became more and more frightened throughout this conversation. He was jolted into standing up and stared at Li Qiye in disbelief.</p>
<p>There were several types of imperial edicts. Some acted as proclamations to the world, others were orders given to the emperor’s generals, and another type was meant to be kept in secrecy.</p>
<p>These secret edicts were normally left for the emperors’ descendants. Moreover, they were not to be opened unless the requirements were met. Otherwise, not even the children of the emperors could open them.</p>
<p>Only talents that satisfied all the requirements would be able to open these secret edicts. Moreover, they would never disclose the contents to anyone, not even their closest friends and family.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored the apparent shock in the youth’s expression. He sat there calmly and enjoyed the wine before speaking: “Didn’t I tell you already? There’s not much that I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng stared at Li Qiye in disbelief. If it was anyone else, then they would be suspicious that Li Qiye was spying on their clan. However, Buzhan Feng knew that this wasn’t possible. If he, as a disciple, didn’t even know about it, how could an outsider figure it out?</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and sat back down. While staring at Li Qiye, he smiled wryly and shook his head: “If Brother Li knows so many secrets already, you should also know that I’m not qualified to open the secret edict. If I could do so, I wouldn’t be asking you right now.”</p>
<p>The level required to look at these edicts was usually the Immortal Emperor realm or something very close. Some said that supreme Godkings could look at them as well, but the future generations didn’t know if this was true or not.</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “I know that you are not qualified, but don’t tell me that no one has seen it in your clan. This might fool others, but not me.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng quietly pondered for a moment. There was indeed someone in the clan who was qualified to do so. However, they wouldn’t necessarily disclose the contents to him.</p>
<p>He revealed: “We do indeed have someone qualified to read it, but this is not the right time. At the very least, this was the case for that ancestor.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “If your clan won’t assist you in this matter, then I can’t help you either. There are some things that you need to work for and, when necessary, you will need to break the rules.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng gently sighed. After a brief pause, he looked at Li Qiye and said in a serious manner: “I know a little bit about the legends regarding the vortex and our Charming Spirit Race, but I do have some questions.”</p>
<p>With that, his attitude became very respectful and sincere.</p>
<p>Li Qiye slowly sipped another mouthful of wine and said: “Go ahead. Since I have drank your wine, I will think about answering if possible.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng began: “As I speculated, Brother Li has gone to the vortex. You also know that we have always been watching it. When one goes there, screams and roars seem to come from its depths. The world quakes before them, is this right?”</p>
<p>The boy was very careful with his words lest Li Qiye became unhappy.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the boy and said: “I know what you want to ask. You are afraid of the beginning of some unwanted matters.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng nodded in response: “I am indeed very worried about this. This is our clan’s mission. There have been rumors that one day, the inevitable shall come and it will bring about a disaster to us charming spirits.”</p>
<p>“It does exist.” Li Qiye said: “However, this is a needless anxiety for you right now. You don’t know that the charming spirits in this world have left certain things behind. This disaster won’t be able to descend on a whim.”</p>
<p>With that, he stared at the youth and continued: “In the Heaven Spirit World, the true power of the Charming Spirit Race is beyond your imagination. And also, if your forefather, Immortal Emperor Buzhan, was able to make his way down there, surely he would have left some precautionary measures behind.”</p>
<p>“And here is the final statement.” Li Qiye raised his cup: “I’ll be borrowing an old saying; one might be able to survive an act of god, but no one can survive a self-brought calamity.”</p>
<p>“One might be able to survive an act of god, but no one can survive a self-brought calamity...” The youth carefully thought over this line from Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Okay, I have said all that needs to be said, drink up.” Li Qiye laughed and took another gulp.</p>
<p>The youth calmed down and quickly poured another cup for him.</p>
<p>Since Buzhan Feng insisted on him staying, Li Qiye remained on the island. In these last few days, the youth came to ask Li Qiye many questions. Whether he answered or not depended on his mood and the nature of the question.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng could be said to be a very studious person, someone who had no shame in asking and learning from even his own subordinates. His questions for Li Qiye had nothing to do with cultivation or merit laws. The majority of them were interesting anecdotes.</p>
<p>A person like him was quite rare. The Buzhan Clan had an exceedingly high position in the Heaven Spirit World so he, as the successor, had great authority. However, he had no visible arrogance or contempt for others. The majority of disciples from the great powers had some pride in them; even if they didn’t bully others, they wouldn’t try to learn from those they deemed inferior.</p>
<p>However, Buzhan Feng didn’t feel that his intelligence was superior to others. He acted as a junior before Li Qiye in his inquisitive quest for knowledge.</p>
<p>It was precisely due to his commendable personality that Li Qiye decided to teach him a thing or two. If it was another successor from a great power, Li Qiye would have ignored him completely.</p>
<p>The youth didn’t give up on trying to set up his big sis with Li Qiye, but regardless of his efforts, there was not the slightest sign of progress.</p>
<p>His sister had no interest in this type of marriage or the bloodlines from stallions. She was even against it, so no matter how much Buzhan Feng tried to persuade her about how great Li Qiye was, she remained aloof.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was even more tired of this matter and was too lazy to go see his sister. In the end, Buzhan Feng had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>He helplessly said: “Sigh, Brother Li, I really do want you to be my brother-in-law. Then, we can be even closer, right?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t want to be rude and only smiled at the boy’s wish to connect the two.</p>
<p>“Really, Brother Li, everything about my big sis is great, it’s just that she doesn’t like to talk about marriage. She views inter-clan marriage as a type of transaction, but we do think that if you two stay together, you will be able to win her over with your charm.”</p>
<p>“Trust me, girls will swoon over your charisma.” The youth persuaded: “Let me arrange it so you two can have a talk under the moonlight.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “People will meet if it is meant to be. If not, then it shouldn’t be forced.”</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng sighed as another attempt at matchmaking failed.</p>
<p>After several more days at the island, Buzhan Feng came and told Li Qiye some news: “Brother Li, you said you wanted to go to the Dragon Demon Sea? There is news that I’m sure will interest you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked: “What news?” After staying here for a while, he had been wanting to leave the Jade Sea for the Dragon Demon Sea because Su Yonghuang had gone there. He wanted to see what clues she was after.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng quickly said: “I heard a skeletal horse has appeared in that region. It is only bones and keeps on running like crazy. No one knows where it came from. The cultivators there tried to capture it to no avail since it is way too fast. A God-Monarch from the sea demon race tried himself, but he still failed.”</p>
<p>“Skeletal horse?” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed after hearing this.</p>
<p>“So you are interested.” Buzhan Feng smiled after seeing Li Qiye’s demeanor: “I heard it appeared in the southwest area—”</p>
<p>But before he could finish, Li Qiye pointed in front of him. With a buzz, he opened a portal and disappeared inside.</p>
<p>His sudden departure left Buzhan Feng speechless since he couldn’t even say goodbye.</p>
<p>At this time, a woman with a supreme appearance appeared by the door. This was a beauty that would cause others to be lost in admiration.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng asked after seeing the woman: “Sis, you are finally here, are you not angry anymore?”</p>
<p>“He is a guest, after all. It would be very rude if I don’t receive him at all after several days.” Her voice was very pleasant.</p>
<p>Buzhan Feng shrugged and said: “You’re one step too late, Sis. Brother Li has left already.”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1229: Skeletal Horse</h4>
<p>Chapter 1229: Skeletal Horse</p>
<p>The Dragon Demon Sea was one of the three great oceans of the Heaven Spirit World. As for why it had this name, this remained a mystery for future generations.</p>
<p>However, one particular legend was very popular. It stated that in an era too ancient to trace, there was a demon dragon with heaven-defying power.</p>
<p>This demon dragon eventually evolved into a true dragon. It wanted to fight against the nine heavens but ultimately failed. In the moment of its death, it fell into a great ocean and, from then on, that ocean was named the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
<p>Most people considered this as mere gossip for tea shops since no one could verify it. No one would go to research it either.</p>
<p>There was a more reliable theory for this name. It believed that because sea demons ruled this sea and since dragons were the leaders of the sea demons, this area took on the name “Dragon Demon Sea”.</p>
<p>This sea was quite vast with countless creatures and sects.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, if the Abyss Sea was the world of the charming spirits and the Jade Sea was the world of the treants, then this region belonged to the sea demons.</p>
<p>There were many powerful demon lineages here. For example, behemoths like the Seven Martial Pavilion or the Roaring Conch were the strongest.</p>
<p>Today, this region was quite lively since many people were gossiping at various restaurants about a particular matter.</p>
<p>A skeletal horse appeared out of nowhere and moved at extreme speeds. There were plenty of bizarre occurrences in the Heaven Spirit World, so a skeletal horse alone was not worthy of attention. The issue was its great speed. Many people tried to catch it to no avail. A sea demon at the God-Monarch level personally took action and still failed to keep up. Thus, the excitement built up as more and more were unable to catch the horse.</p>
<p>The cultivators couldn’t help but talk about it. Some believed that it had escaped from the Bonesea. In their eyes, only that place would be able to produce such a steed.</p>
<p>However, there were those who had a different opinion about it. For generations, no skeleton has been able to escape from the Bonesea. Thus, this particular theory was too difficult to believe.</p>
<p>However, if this was indeed the case, then the other question would be about the new and sudden changes at the Bonesea.</p>
<p>A blue ocean and blue sky with fish leaping out of the shallow surface while eagles soared high above. The breeze blew by, carrying a faint scent of saltwater. This was surprisingly pleasant.</p>
<p>“Clok, clok, clok…” A crisp and rhythmic galloping broke this tranquil scene as a skeletal horse traveled on the sea's surface.</p>
<p>However, it was way too fast. Ordinary people couldn’t see it at all, only its dark afterimage was visible.</p>
<p>Only those strong enough would be able to see its appearance. There was no flesh left on its pitch black skeleton, as if it was dyed to this color. Each bone emitted a black mist that formed long lines when it sped faster. The result was something like a landscape painting.</p>
<p>Despite its current dreadful appearance, judging by its build, it was definitely wonderful when it was still alive. Even calling it a divine steed would not be enough.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” A portal opened and Li Qiye walked out. He stood in the sky, looking at the horse running across the sea. A terrifying glint shot out from his eyes.</p>
<p>Li Qiye uttered to himself: “What is that girl looking for? To even awaken the mount of Immortal Emperor Bu Si...”</p>
<p>The girl he was referring to was Su Yonghuang.</p>
<p>He smiled and transformed into another person. It was an unbelievably dashing youth that wore a gray robe. His body was shrouded by a gray mist, giving off an unfathomable appearance just like a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” His inner physique emerged. In this split second, he pushed the Soaring Immortal Physique to the limit and soared outside with incomparable speed.</p>
<p>The skeletal horse galloped through the sea. Not long after, it saw a young man shrouded in a gray mist standing on the sea.</p>
<p>It immediately stopped in front of the youth. Despite how fast it was going, not one drop of water was splashed.</p>
<p>The youth smiled and rubbed its skull: “I have just been reborn yet you have found me already.”</p>
<p>“Neighh!” It raised its front hooves and cheered with great excitement. After neighing, it intimately shoved its head under the palm of the young man.</p>
<p>However, just a moment later, a red light flashed in its empty eye sockets. With a long cry, both of its front legs kicked forward at the young man with lightning speed without holding anything back.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The youth was instantly blown away and plowed a deep trench on the sea's surface.</p>
<p>“Neighh!” The horse let out an intimidating cry before galloping into the sky, disappearing once again.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The youth jumped out of the sea. He shook his head and returned to his true form. This was Li Qiye, of course.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked towards the direction of the horse and slowly said: “Incredible, luckily I came prepared or I would have become meat paste under its hooves.”</p>
<p>Earlier, he took the appearance of the young Immortal Emperor Bu Si in order to trick the horse. In the beginning, it was indeed successful. Alas, the horse was a divine item, so it saw through the disguise.</p>
<p>Li Qiye murmured: “Bu Si, what did you leave behind back then?!”</p>
<p>According to legend, the emperor could be reborn again and again. But in the end, he was the only emperor known by the entire world to have collapsed, the only one whose final whereabouts were clear. [1. This is not counting Ta Kong in this world.]</p>
<p>No one knew why he collapsed back then during his generation. No one believed that such a day would come. Back then, he could be resurrected again and again due to his grasp of his undying art, definitively proving that he was unkillable. However, someone with the title of undying still collapsed in the end!</p>
<p>“Interesting, I’d like to see what you left behind.” Li Qiye jumped to the sky again and casually pointed in front of him to make another portal. He teleported to chase after the horse again.</p>
<p>For other people, not to mention catching it, just keeping up with it was more difficult than reaching the heavens. However, Li Qiye trained in both the Soaring Immortal Physique and the Space Scripture, so it was quite easy for him to catch up.</p>
<p>While the horse bolted below, Li Qiye leisurely followed it from the sky. It knew that Li Qiye was on its tail, but it didn’t seem to care and continued on the same trajectory.</p>
<p>After all, it was the mount of an Immortal Emperor and had power matching that position. It didn’t care if someone was chasing it.</p>
<p>Along the way, the spectators continued to be dumbfounded since they could only see a shadow flying by. After several more days, the horse finally made it to its destination.</p>
<p>A mountain range was situated above the sea. Each peak was wrapped in a blue reflection due to its geographical location. Many of them were shrouded in mist, so no one could catch a glimpse of its true appearance.</p>
<p>Such a grand mountain range stretched across the sea. From a distance, it looked like a huge dragon occupying this sea region. It was a very magnificent scene that made other people realize their own insignificance.</p>
<p>Flying in the sky, Li Qiye saw it from far away. He murmured: “Giant Dragon Mountain Range. So many years have passed, yet the scenery remains without the slightest change.”</p>
<p>He was lost in reminiscence, with many events of the past flashing by. Memories buried deep in his mind resurfaced one after another.</p>
<p>The smiles and sounds of the past were vivid, as if he was suddenly back there. All of the happy scenes seemed to have happened just yesterday.</p>
<p>“Crash!” While Li Qiye was in a daze, the skeletal horse quickly dove into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1230: Dongting Lake</h4>
<p>Chapter 1230: Dongting Lake</p>
<p>If the Giant Dragon Mountain Range resembled a beast entrenched in the sea, then Dongting Lake was a jewel in the beast’s mouth. [1. Dongting is a real lake so I kept the pinyin. Literal name is "Grotto Court Lake".]</p>
<p>As a lake within an ocean, it could be considered a miracle. Moreover, the water here was different from the water of the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
<p>The lake was surrounded by undulating mountains that formed a circle. There were still blue waves within the lake. The islands in the vicinity were quite beautiful as well.</p>
<p>Dongting Lake was both the name of this region and the name of a lineage.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, if the Exquisite Valley was the largest human lineage and Peacock Land was its largest diaspora, then Dongting Lake would be the human race's third largest base and its second-biggest lineage.</p>
<p>According to legend, the lake was established by several powerful sages of the human race. Even now, it was quite populated and held considerable influence.</p>
<p>Of course, it couldn’t compare to the Exquisite Valley, but it was still an ideal home for humans.</p>
<p>There was a difference between the lake and Peacock Land. Humans at Peacock Land were unrestrained, but this wasn’t the case for those at the lake. If they weren’t disciples of the lake, then both cultivators and mortals must accept the management of the sect in order to stay.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, land was a precious commodity. A place like Dongting Lake was even more precious. It had plenty of space and was close to the dragon mountain as well as Rainbow City. More importantly, it was rich with various kinds of treasures.</p>
<p>The mountains nearby were full of spirit vegetation. The lake itself also produced many rare treasures. There were rumors of a spring below the lake with plenty of divine metals and ores.</p>
<p>In principle, the people in the Heaven Spirit World would always desire any location with land. This was especially true for a treasure land like Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>In the Dragon Demon Sea, the sea clans were extremely powerful with untouchable authorities! But strangely enough, no one tried to take over a wonderful location like Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>One could say that Dongting Lake was as powerful as a sect. After all, it was considered a great power at the Heaven Spirit World. However, it was inferior to an imperial lineage or a sea god’s sect.</p>
<p>Ordinary great powers wouldn’t be able to eat the fat piece of meat that is the lake, but unparalleled lineages like the Seven Martial Pavilion and the Roaring Conch were definitely capable. Strangely enough, they didn’t touch the lake. It was something worth musing.</p>
<p>Various theories arose about the reason the lake was able to exist until now. Some believed that the sect itself was strong enough and the location was easy to defend while hard to attack. Another theory was that the pavilion and conch didn’t care for the lake.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Li Qiye was not anxious to catch up to the horse that had snuck into the sea. He had left behind his mark so he could chase it at any time. Various emotions resurfaced in his mind after seeing the jewel of the ocean — Dongting Lake. Eventually, he landed on the lake and took a stroll.</p>
<p>He went up to one of the islands and decided to walk barefoot through the soft sand to feel the land. There was an indescribable sensation of comfort as well as a great sense of remembrance.</p>
<p>There were eighteen different forts at the lake, each with their own beautiful sceneries such as the resplendent sun shining down on the lake’s surface that was as blue as jade… There were plenty of such locations in this area.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye’s favorite was the “thousand carps playing in the water”. He enjoyed watching this pretty scene the most.</p>
<p>Because of this, he came to this particular bay and prepared a large bowl of bait. Stomping on the sand while looking at the blue lake granted him serenity and satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Splash!” He grabbed a lot of bait and scattered it into the lake. One carp after another immediately began to appear. They surfaced to seize the bait floating on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>As he threw in more bait, more carps came out to play. The sound of splashing water continuously resounded.</p>
<p>Clusters of fish were now here vying for the food. Beads of water splashed and were illuminated by the bright sun. These carp came in all types and colors. Some were purple while others were a scintillating gold…</p>
<p>The myriad colors twinkled under the sun. These lights interwove with the waves and created little rainbows that were extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>After throwing out all the bait, he simply sat on the sand-laden bay to watch the carps. He relished every second and seemed to forget about everything. The past was no more, his worries carried away by the wind while everything else disappeared like clouds and smoke.</p>
<p>Eventually, all the bait was consumed and the carps dispersed. The crashing ripples calmed as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>There was a grin on his face as he rested his legs in the refreshing water of the lake.</p>
<p>At this time, he had traveled through space and time to a distant era when he did the exact same thing. Soaking in the lake offered him a rare sense of invigoration. Some carps curiously swam over.</p>
<p>One would feel that everything happens for a reason. Thinking of this, Li Qiye began to smile. There were too many memories in life, but very few moments of happiness. However, just this little amount was precious enough.</p>
<p>Water suddenly splashed with crashing waves, breaking the tranquility of the bay.</p>
<p>“Hey, where is your label?” Li Qiye was woken up by this call. He looked forward and saw a ship approaching him.</p>
<p>It was a medium-sized warship wrapped in armor with a very sharp look. A middle-aged man was standing at the bow. Just one glance was enough to tell that he was a human cultivator. His robe had a sandy color and was embroidered with the insignia of Dongting Lake, letting others know that he was its disciple.</p>
<p>Li Qiye slightly frowned and asked: “Label, what label?”</p>
<p>“Anyone who comes to Dongting Lake must register with us to be given a label. Otherwise, they must disclose their identity.” The middle-aged man lowered his tone.</p>
<p>Li Qiye lazily replied with a carefree expression: “Is that so? There’s no need to ask me for this label or whatever, return from whence you came.”</p>
<p>“You!” The man felt provoked by Li Qiye’s attitude. He glared at him, wanting to get off the ship to question him.</p>
<p>However, before he could get down, someone stopped him. It was a woman who said: “Supervisor Yu, leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Her voice was very clear and soft, yet also had a hint of directness and boldness.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man coldly stared at Li Qiye then snorted before going back inside the ship.</p>
<p>“May I ask for your name?” She looked at him and calmly said: “I am Hong Yujiao, a disciple of Dongting Lake. Patrolling the lake is our responsibility.”</p>
<p>This woman was very beautiful. Even though she was not as kingdom-toppling as Zhuo Jianshi’s bunch, she had her own style and wore a tight bluish-green dress. It wrapped her body and revealed all the curves of her figure. Her towering soft breasts were plump enough to accentuate her slender waist. Such an outfit seemed like it was built for someone who often dives into the water.</p>
<p>She had a little makeup on her face, making her even more charming. Her willowy brows carried both a touch of femininity and a hint of tenacity. Her spirited pair of round and large eyes were bright, giving off a sharp and determined sensation.</p>
<p>Despite not being a kingdom-toppling beauty, her firm and resolute demeanor made her quite attractive. This was a woman with a straightforward style.</p>
<p>“Surname Hong?” Li Qiye raised his brows and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am Hong Yujiao. May I ask for your name and where you are from?” She cupped her fists decisively like a man would. This was a woman who wouldn’t concede to men. [2. This particular idiom is difficult to keep the raw form. However, it is definitely praising a woman despite the discriminatory origin/nature of the phrase in ancient China. The raw is, “a headdress (woman) won’t yield to beard and brows (man). Back in ancient times, women were called “headdresses” and men were called “beard and brows”. These are literary terms used when the author wants to exaggerate the masculine and feminine aspects of the respective sexes, often in a positive manner, but it can be derogatory as well.]</p>
<p>In fact, claiming herself as a disciple was a very modest way to put it. The Hong Clan had an exceedingly pivotal status at Dongting Lake. Their clan had always been a pillar of this location.</p>
<p>Li Qiye closed his eyes, showing his lack of interest: “I am only a passerby. Where I’m from and what my name is are not important.”</p>
<p>She calmly replied: “Sir, I hope you can understand that this is for the safety of the lake. We require everyone to register with us. Please be considerate.”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1231: Hundred-Saints Hall</h4>
<p>Chapter 1231: Hundred-Saints Hall</p>
<p>“Dongting Lake now…” After hearing this, Li Qiye glanced at Hong Yujiao and shook his head disapprovingly: “This once all-accommodating land of treasures has lost the model crafted by the old wise sages. It no longer has the same temperament in its attempt to vie for power.”</p>
<p>After hearing such words, Hong Yujiao’s heart skipped a beat. She wasn’t too clear on the meaning of his emotional statement.</p>
<p>Li Qiye dazedly stared at the barely visible islands scattered across the lake. He eventually calmed down and stared at her to speak with a dismissive tone: “I am only here for a bit and will leave soon. Don’t worry about me.”</p>
<p>She looked back at him and cupped her fists to say: “If Fellow Daoist will leave soon, then I won’t bother you any longer. However, if you want to stay here for more than one day, I hope that you will cooperate with us by filing and receiving a label. If you have any questions, feel free to find me anytime.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and lied down on the sand to watch the blue sky and white clouds without a care for others.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao took another look at this ordinary and strange fella. Eventually, she refrained from commenting and let her people steer the ship away.</p>
<p>Li Qiye softly sighed again. Dongting Lake was indeed a nice place. In the past, several wise sages established this location as a starting point for the humans to have a strong backing in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
<p>These sages were very broad-minded; they were oceans that could shelter a hundred streams. Because of this, the lake was once more powerful than the Exquisite Valley.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, prosperity came and a desire for profits and gains arose. Not just anyone could be so magnanimous and altruistic like these sages; their descendants didn’t share the same attitude. When they eventually gained power, they couldn’t escape the temptation of having even more.</p>
<p>“This lake used to be so wonderful...” Li Qiye was slightly disappointed: “Alas, its descendants have fallen short.”</p>
<p>He dispelled these thoughts from his mind since he was enjoying a rare moment of peace.</p>
<p>Time continued to pass like the quiet white clouds gently drifting in the sky, something that nobody would pay attention to.</p>
<p>No one knows how long he had been lying on the sand for. Suddenly, his mind shifted after feeling a summons and immediately opened his eyes. In a split second, he leaped into the sky and rushed out of the lake.</p>
<p>The Giant Dragon Mountain Range was more than just a ring of mountains surrounding Dongting Lake. Many islets were right outside, and the majority of them already had owners. These islets scattered outside the lake were like thrown out pearls.</p>
<p>One of these islets in particular was quite large. Many old pavilions and buildings were built on it, though most had collapsed and were invaded by thickets of weeds.</p>
<p>It was a desolate location. Only a few buildings at the very top of the island remained intact. These buildings were built around an ancient temple.</p>
<p>The temple was very old. The whole structure seemed to have stemmed from one solid piece. The gray walls appeared to have been carved out of a single gigantic stone.</p>
<p>An old plaque was hung above the old temple. It appeared to be made out of bronze yet wasn't bronze, iron but not iron, wood but not wood. Who knows what it was made from?</p>
<p>The plaque had been through many years and looked like time had polished away all traces of what was written on this plaque. Nevertheless, one could still see three faintly visible words engraved on it — Hundred-Saints Hall.</p>
<p>These words were etched with an archaic style, so only the knowledgeable would be able to recognize them. The three words had suffered the battering of time for too long, so they became quite blurred. One could almost see stars lingering around them, as if they contained a portion of a vast universe.</p>
<p>If someone with good insight took an even more careful look, they would find something else. It looked like there was indeed a celestial system and a universe around them. Within this universe was a great army, an invincible cavalry that was stationed here.</p>
<p>However, they were too tiny, especially for those with weaker vision. Everything was placed around these three words. There was also a figure. Upon careful examination, one would find a crow carved above these three words. When it spread its wings, the crow shielded the words as if it was granting them its protection.</p>
<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” At this time, sounds of violence could be heard. A young man holding a giant hammer was fiercely smashing the doors to the ancient temple. Alas, it didn’t matter how hard he slammed down, he couldn't break open the doors even though they were made out of wood.</p>
<p>An old man that looked nearly fifty shouted: “Stop!” He wore gray clothing and had distinct facial features, but his body was thin and feeble. One could see that he was a cultivator, but his blood energy was incredibly weak, indicating his shallow cultivation.</p>
<p>The old man shouted to stop the young man, but before he could do anything, five other burly men stopped and immobilized him.</p>
<p>“Bang!” The youth mercilessly smashed the door, but it still wouldn’t open.</p>
<p>He had a pair of hawk-like eyes while his back was covered with armored fish scales. The five men holding down the old men had the same scales.</p>
<p>This was a big race in the Heaven Spirit World. The scales were the defining characteristic of the Ironscale School, a fish tribe among the sea demons. They barely meet the qualifications to be considered a big race with their nest being around one thousand miles away from the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. The ideal nests for them were deep in trenches.</p>
<p>The youth was the young lord of the Ironscale School, Lei Yu. He wanted to establish a stronghold outside of his school and had chosen this island.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only descendant of the Hundred-Saints Hall was this old man. He didn’t want to sell the island, leading to this conflict.</p>
<p>“Old geezer, didn’t you say your hall was protected by the sacred sages of the nine heavens and ten earths? Where are they now?” Lei Yu looked at the captured old man and laughed boisterously.</p>
<p>It was a pity that the old man’s cultivation was too weak. He simply was not a match for the muscular men.</p>
<p>He struggled but was pushed down again. Alas, he was unyielding and lifted up his head to declare: “I will not sell off the Hundred-Saints Hall even if it means my death!”</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to sell it, then I might as well smash it apart!” Lei Yu turned cruel and glared at the ancient temple.</p>
<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” More explosions could be heard, but he still couldn’t break open the temple no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>He mustered all of his strength like a baby drinking its mother’s milk, but it was all for naught. He became quite angry and decided to take it out on this old man by mercilessly stomping on him.</p>
<p>“Old geezer, I have plenty of time. Today, I’ll torture you to death and my school will take its time breaking down this place. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you quickly, not until I flatten this land. I want to see the despair in your eyes!” With that, he unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks on the old man.</p>
<p>The youth was livid. He originally wanted to break this temple down first before forcing the sale. However, he simply couldn’t destroy this building at all; this only provoked his greed to possess this place. He believed that there was definitely an incredible treasure on this island, perhaps inside the temple.</p>
<p>He became even more determined to occupy this island before others caught wind of it.</p>
<p>The old man was quite stubborn. Despite vomiting blood from Lei Yu’s barrage, he still kept his head high without letting out a single groan.</p>
<p>“Old geezer, your bones are quite hard, yeah?” Lei Yu sneered and stomped on him again; a crisp crack made it apparent that a bone snapped.</p>
<p>The old man finally grunted. He was clearly in deep pain, but he didn’t let out a full scream.</p>
<p>“Heh, geezer Zhang, no matter how hard your bones are, I can still kill you as easily as killing an ant. Beg for your saints to come and save you. Where are they now?”</p>
<p>The old man still didn’t utter a word and spent all of his energy on keeping his head high. His unyielding attitude only further enraged Lei Yu.</p>
<p>Lei Yu stomped on the old man’s face and sneered: “Hahaha, tell these saints protecting your temple to appear already so that I can see what these so-called saints of the nine heavens and ten earths look like!”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” A chilling voice sounded at this time: “Do you really wish to see the saints of the nine heavens and ten earths?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye landed in front of the temple with a frigid demeanor and glared at Lei Yu’s group.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1232: Zhang Baitu</h4>
<p>Chapter 1232: Zhang Baitu</p>
<p>Lei Yu and his robust followers couldn’t contain their laughter after seeing an ordinary human like Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Lei Yu mocked: “Boy, what now? You want to stand up for your fellow race? But before doing that, you need to weigh yourself—”</p>
<p>“Boom!” But before he could finish his spiel, his five followers were rendered into pulp, their blood staining the stone slabs on the ground.</p>
<p>These men didn’t even know how or why they died. They couldn’t even react before being crushed completely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lei Yu started seeing stars. Li Qiye had one foot on his body, so he couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>The previously captured old man was also frightened out of his mind. He stared at Li Qiye in disbelief since he couldn’t even see part of the process.</p>
<p>His followers being annihilated as well as his lack of ability to retaliate while being trampled upon made Lei Yu’s soul leave his body.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chillingly spoke: “No one is allowed to defile the Hundred-Saints Hall!”</p>
<p>Lei Yu shouted: “Little, little boy… do you, you know who I am? I am the young lord of the Ironscale School and my father is the schoolmaster. If, if you dare to hurt me, my father will not only kill you, he’ll annihilate the entire hall as well…!” He was quite afraid, so he had to bring up his father.</p>
<p>“Crack!” Bones were broken, causing him to scream. Li Qiye had crushed his face with a stomp. Flesh and blood went flying as Lei Yu writhed in agony.</p>
<p>Li Qiye emotionlessly declared: “I am sparing your dog life so that you can tell your father to personally cut off your head and bring it here as an apology. His failure in teaching you will also result in his decapitation as well. If he heeds my words, then I shall spare your Ironscale School. Otherwise they will not see tomorrow’s sun!”</p>
<p>With that, Li Qiye lifted his foot from Lei Yu and kicked him off the island before saying: “Scram.”</p>
<p>Lei Yu was kicked into the ocean and pissed his pants from fear. He immediately dived down and escaped out of sight.</p>
<p>The old man was still in shock and couldn’t stand up from the ground. Li Qiye gently sighed while looking at the old man before helping him up.</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked: “What is your name?”</p>
<p>The old man took a while before answering: “My, my surname is Zhang. Everyone calls me Baitu.” Having said that, he felt quite dejected despite his stubborn nature. However, his head was still held up high the entire time.</p>
<p>Li Qiye lamented while looking at him: “Why did the descendants of the Zhang Clan fall to this level?”</p>
<p>The stubborn demeanor of the old man reminded him of someone.</p>
<p>Li Qiye threw a medicine bottle over to Zhang Baitu and said: “You are badly hurt, so take this.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu accepted the bottle and poured a pill into his palm. His heart jumped after seeing the shining golden hue. He looked over at Li Qiye in astonishment. Despite his lack of knowledge, he still knew that this piece of medicine was a big deal.</p>
<p>“Take it.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve as he didn’t want to waste more words.</p>
<p>After a short silence, the old man quietly took the medicine.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stood before the temple and looked at the old plaque that was hung up high, gazing at the crow engraved above the three words “Hundred-Saints Hall”. He stood there, silently looking at this plaque for a long time.</p>
<p>Eventually, he looked back at the old man and asked: “Aren’t clans like the Zhang and Hong responsible for taking turns to protect the hall?”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was surprised to see a human junior aware of this matter. He eventually replied: “My ancestors accepted the responsibility of protecting this place.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Li Qiye nodded: “I understand. Your ancestors lost the conflict for power at Dongting Lake back then and had to move out, correct?”</p>
<p>“How, how do you know that?” Zhang Baitu was surprised. Even the elite disciples of the lake didn’t know about the power struggle of their ancestors.</p>
<p>“For power, even blood brothers can become enemies, let alone mere friends.” Li Qiye stated without answering the question. He sighed once more while looking at the plaque.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu eventually calmed down and bowed towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble, how should I address you?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye answered: “Li Qiye, just a passerby.”</p>
<p>He didn’t have a big reaction after hearing this name and only nodded. He was only a little character and hadn’t heard of Li Qiye’s name before.</p>
<p>“Squeak—” Li Qiye pushed open the wooden doors to the hall. Lei Yu used all of his strength to desperately smash open these doors to no avail, yet Li Qiye opened them so easily.</p>
<p>“How, how can this be!” The old man couldn’t believe his own wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Li Qiye turned back at him.</p>
<p>“Because, because these doors have never been opened by anyone.” Zhang Baitu was stammering. In his memories, no one had been able to open these doors. His seniors and even many big shots from Dongting Lake all failed.</p>
<p>According to the legends, the hall was protected by the wise saints of the world; their power safeguarded this hall.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t reply as he stepped inside. The astounded old man calmed down and quickly followed.</p>
<p>He had to ask: “Young Noble Li, are, are you one of the saints?”</p>
<p>The unopened doors had been opened by Li Qiye, so perhaps this was one of the legendary saints.</p>
<p>“Saint? Are you referring to the saints that protect the hall?” Li Qiye laughed and said: “If you believe so, then I can be considered one.”</p>
<p>With that, he went inside. This hall was very simple without any further decorations other than a stone pillar. Contrary to people’s expectations, the end of the hall contained no treasures. There was only a line of memorial tablets with names engraved on them.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was caught in a long silence while looking at these all-too familiar names. He began to bow in front of each one while feeling quite sentimental inside.</p>
<p>This was Zhang Baitu’s first time seeing these tablets and names. However, the majority of them had the surname Zhang, Hong, or Xu.</p>
<p>After a while, he quietly asked Li Qiye: “Are these, are these the tablets of my ancestors?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Li Qiye softly nodded: “They are the wise sages of the human race, the pride of humanity. Even during the era of darkness, they continued to defend the dignity of our race and protected its final dawn.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu had no comments. He didn’t know anything about his ancestors. Only he remained of the Zhang Clan, and he rarely mingled with Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the descendants did not inherit the ambition or beliefs of their ancestors. After so many generations of friendship, they still couldn’t avoid the temptation of one thing — power.” Li Qiye bemoaned while looking at the tablets.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Zhang, Hong, and Xu were friends for generations. Their clans all followed Li Qiye, and they eventually settled down in this place, creating Dongting Lake. It was meant to be a shelter for the human race in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
<p>The lake was once a prominent power. In its heyday, even the Exquisite Valley was far from being comparable.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the descendants of these friends betrayed each other later on. They fought for power to the point of life and death.</p>
<p>Because of this, Li Qiye didn’t want to bother with the lake’s unfilial mindset or power struggles.</p>
<p>After a long time, he withdrew his gaze and glanced over at Zhang Baitu, flatly stating: “Even if your Zhang Clan lost the fight back then, it shouldn’t have deteriorated to this state.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and responded: “I don’t know much about the ancestors’ business. I heard that after leaving the lake, they decided to stay here and act as guards. It is we descendants who were useless and failed to pass on our lineage. By the time my father’s generation arrived, we were already finished. During my youth, my father and uncles departed one after another, unable to maintain the inheritance. In the end, I could only learn a few superficial things.”</p>
<p>In the past, the three clans ruled the lake together. Later on, the Zhang Clan lost the internal conflict. Their ancestors were stubborn as well, so after losing, they moved out of the lake and settled here.</p>
<p>Because their clan had lost a lot of resources, it was sent into a nosedive; each generation became worse than the previous.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1233: Zhang Clan</h4>
<p>Chapter 1233: Zhang Clan</p>
<p>Li Qiye came out of the hall and sat on a stone step to gaze at the vast sea and its unrestrained waves while the soft breeze blew. This went on quietly for some time.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn’t know Li Qiye’s origin. In his eyes, the youth was too mysterious and simply impossible to speculate.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu couldn’t help but ask: “Young Noble, where did you come from?”</p>
<p>“From where I should.” Li Qiye looked over at Zhang Baitu and said: “I see that your cultivation is needlessly complex and unrefined. There’s your own clan’s merit law, then there are the incantations from the sea demons and internal strengthening from the treants. This is very chaotic, so your blood energy isn’t flowing well.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was surprised after hearing this. Li Qiye being able to see through him despite being so young made him feel quite dejected.</p>
<p>“After the seniors left, I couldn’t learn a lot beyond the elementary basics, so I had to go outside to find teachers. I joined many sects but failed to make much progress and had to return to the Hundred-Saints Hall in hopes of being able to live the rest of my life here like a falling leaf returning to its roots.” A great sadness was expressed by his eyes; there were too many words he wanted to say, but he kept it brief.</p>
<p>So it turned out that after the seniors of his clan passed away, he couldn’t learn the remaining merit laws as they were missing.</p>
<p>He wasn’t willing to give up, so he left his home to find masters. Who knows if it was due to his own inability or some other reasons? Either way, this search didn’t go smoothly.</p>
<p>In this process, he learned very slowly, and the same went for his cultivation. In fact, “very slow” wasn’t enough to describe his cultivation, “as slow as a snail’s pace” was a more appropriate analogy.</p>
<p>It was slow to the point where the sects he had joined agreed to let him leave. Sometimes he even left of his own volition.</p>
<p>For many sects, there was no leaving after joining. However, there was no cure for Zhang Baitu’s cultivation speed. To put it bluntly, even if he didn’t want to leave, they would want him to leave eventually. Having such a disciple was simply losing face.</p>
<p>Just like this, he joined one sect after another but amounted to nothing. He eventually joined too many sects in the Dragon Demon Sea and became quite well-known. Everyone called him Zhang Baitu. It referred to him being the disciple of too many sects. No one even remembered his real name. [1. Baitu = Hundred-Disciple.]</p>
<p>In the end, he helplessly spoke with a dejected expression: “It is because I am too stupid and have an inferior constitution. I have let down my masters and seniors; I’m even weaker than a new disciple even after a lifetime of cultivation.”</p>
<p>He lamented with a sigh after saying this and felt despair. In the beginning, he thought that it was because he didn’t have a suitable merit law or a teacher. As time went on and he suffered many successive failures, he lost all confidence and began to consider himself stupid and unsuitable for cultivation. So in this way, he returned to his home, the Hundred-Saints Hall, to live out the rest of his life.</p>
<p>He mumbled to himself: “Maybe I was not meant to be a part of this world. I was born a mortal, why the need to enter the cultivation world?”</p>
<p>After joining so many sects and cultivating so many laws, he couldn't blame anyone but himself.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and lightly said: “It is not that your constitution and talents are lacking nor is it due to your stupidity. All things in life have a cause and effect. It is just that you haven’t found your own karma yet.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu smiled bitterly and replied: “There’s no need to comfort me, Young Noble. Some seniors have told me the same thing. If it really isn’t due to my own constitution, then why haven’t I made a half-step of progress?”</p>
<p>From his perspective, Li Qiye was only comforting him with the same words he had heard many times before from the nice seniors of the other sects.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nonchalantly shook his head: “A child of the Zhang Clan is different after all. It will be fine if you cultivate your clan’s merit law.”</p>
<p>“Our own merit law?” Zhang Baitu’s surprise quickly turned into curiosity as he asked: “Young Noble, do you know our clan’s merit law?”</p>
<p>In fact, he was very interested because Li Qiye was able to open the wooden doors of the hall, something that no one else had ever done before. Thus, he suspected that Li Qiye was a legendary saint.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t know what a saint or sage was. They were only figures of the old tales after all. Despite all the rumors about the Hundred-Saints Hall being protected by the wise sages of the nine heavens and ten earths, the descendants of the three clans had never seen any of them before.</p>
<p>Li Qiye faintly smiled and replied: “If you want your clan’s lost merit laws, then just go back to Dongting Lake. In the past, the Hong, Zhang, and Xu Clans should have had some treasures. Perhaps you can find your laws there.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu slightly opened his mouth but ultimately refrained from saying anything and only sighed.</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked: “Could it be that Dongting Lake has been snubbing your Zhang Clan?”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu paused for a moment before answering: “I don’t know much about the business of the elders, but the lake does care about me. They don’t try to push me away.”</p>
<p>“It is you who doesn’t want to go back.” Li Qiye understood his pride right away.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Li Qiye went on: “Let the past disappear. Your ancestors’ power struggle is ancient history. The Xu, Hong, and Zhang Clans once fought together; friends to the death, friends on the battlefield. They never gave up on each other even in the most brutal of times. Even if it was blood for blood, they would still support each other to live on…</p>
<p>“As the descendants, all of you are indeed unworthy. Excluding each other just for a little power using treachery and deceit — this is simply throwing away all your ancestors’ face and tarnishing their great friendships.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye stopped for a moment at this point: “After so many years, those who competed for power are probably no longer there. It is time for you all to come back and mutually support each other as a big, interdependent family again. Only in this way will your Dongting Lake be able to survive in the future.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye would rarely give out advice in such a well-meaningful manner to outsiders. This was indicative of his respect for the ancestors of the three clans.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu had no response. As a descendant, he wasn’t in a position to comment on his ancestors’ business. Perhaps he was feeling a bit resentful as well.</p>
<p>“The people from the Zhang Clan are always a bit too proud.” Li Qiye just smiled since he understood Zhang Baitu’s feelings.</p>
<p>He continued on: “You might be angry and unhappy with the Hong Clan pushing your ancestors away from Dongting Lake. The Zhang Clan was one of the founding families, so this feeling of indignation is unavoidable.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Zhang Baitu spoke: “Dongting Lake has no ill-will towards me, as far as my generation is concerned. I don’t know much about the conflicts back then, only that after leaving, my ancestors didn’t want to return to the lake. They settled here instead, and this has been our home ever since.”</p>
<p>“A thousand years of anger… it is time to let it go.” Li Qiye only grinned. He didn’t know much about the power grab between these descendants since he couldn’t bother finding out about this rotten business.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he still hoped that these descendants could come together some day. These clans used to coexist and not one piece could be missing. Only through unity would the lake be able to survive in the future.</p>
<p>“When I was younger, this resentment was more or less already there.” Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and sighed: “But now, I am closer to the earth than the sky, so I don’t care too much about unnecessary things. All of this no longer matters. The enmity between the ancestors, just let it go; right and wrong is already in the past.” [2. Closer to the earth than the sky means close to death.]</p>
<p>After personally uttering these words, he felt quite relaxed. The enmity between their clans should disperse like smoke.</p>
<p>During those years, their Zhang Clan was pushed away from the central power of the lake. Their ancestors furiously moved out and decided to guard the Hundred-Saints Hall instead and cut all ties with the lake. Because of this, the Zhang descendants harbored resentment for many generations and didn’t want anything to do with the Hong and Xu Clans.</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at the old man and said: “It is good to think this way. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. One day, you will be able to laugh while thinking of these old grudges.”</p>
<p>“Crash!” At this time, the water started to splash violently as more than one hundred Ironscale cultivators rode the waves to come closer.</p>
<p>“Not good, the Ironscale Schoolmaster is here in person.” Zhang Baitu’s expression quickly changed after seeing these wave-riding experts. He didn’t think that the school would come so fast. Moreover, the schoolmaster and the elders came in person.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1234: Old Plaque</h4>
<p>Chapter 1234: Old Plaque</p>
<p>More than one hundred experts from the Ironscale School as mighty as tigers and wolves were riding the waves forward. In the blink of an eye, they climbed up to the Hundred-Saints Hall. Their leader was an old man whose back had an armor suffused with a golden glow. This was a special characteristic of the Ironscale Tribe after they reached a certain power level.</p>
<p>This leader turned out to be the Ironscale Schoolmaster, Lei Yu’s father.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu turned pale after seeing so many experts from this school. Even though he was a seasoned man who had seen a lot of the world, he still shuddered in fear before such powerful enemies.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu calmed down and hurriedly told Li Qiye: “Young Noble, leave quickly. Two hands cannot win against four fists. As long as the verdant hills remain, there is no fear of lacking firewood.”</p>
<p>Despite his shallow cultivation, he could still tell that Li Qiye was powerful. However, the school had more than one hundred experts, Li Qiye alone would find it difficult to oppose them.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.” Li Qiye sat on the stone steps and smiled: “The unrepentant must pay a huge price.”</p>
<p>The Ironscale Schoolmaster and his fellow experts came before the temple. They saw Li Qiye sitting on top of a stone step without a care. Lei Yu’s expression became twisted as he pointed at Li Qiye and yelled: “Are you the one who killed my disciples and harmed my son?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at him and smiled: “That’s right. Are you going to cut off your son’s head as well as your own to beg for forgiveness before the Hundred-Saints Hall now?”</p>
<p>“A fool knows no fear. Still daring to boast? My Ironscale School will tear you into pieces. And as for you, old man, this is on your head as well.” Lei Yu screamed with eyes spewing a fiery fury. As a descendant of a big sect, he had never been humiliated like this before.</p>
<p>“Beg for forgiveness towards the hall?” The schoolmaster couldn’t help but laugh: “What the hell is this place that justifies my school begging for forgiveness? You have already committed an unforgivable sin, I shall take your head and offer it to my disciples so that they can watch from the heavens…”</p>
<p>“... as for you, Old Zhang.” The schoolmaster’s eyes turned cold as he spoke imposingly: “You sold this island to my school and took our money, yet you dare to renege on it? A crime worthy of death. Today, I will take this island in accordance to the agreement and crush the Hundred-Saints Hall.”</p>
<p>“Liar!” Zhang Baitu jumped out after hearing this and pointed at the schoolmaster: “Since, since when did I sell this island to your school?! This is simply coercion!”</p>
<p>“Is that right?” The schoolmaster sneered and took out a contract: “It is clearly written as such on this contract. I trust that in just a moment, your fingerprint will be on it on top of an oath with your true fate.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu trembled from anger. He knew what the school wanted to do, so he snapped: “Lei, don’t even think about it! I would commit suicide before letting you succeed! This island will forever belong to my clan, you won’t be able to take it!”</p>
<p>“Really now?” The schoolmaster smiled deviously: “I’m afraid your Zhang Clan is about to meet its end, do you still think the island will belong to the clan then?”</p>
<p>“You…” Zhang Baitu was quivering with rage and could no longer speak.</p>
<p>“To tell the truth, I’m a bit disappointed with you sea demons.” Li Qiye lazily stood up at this time: “It has been too long and you demons have such bad memories. Perhaps you all have forgotten who you can and cannot afford to provoke. It looks like I need to stain this place with blood as a reminder that this is the Hundred-Saints Hall, its holiness is inviolable and protected by the sages of the nine heavens and ten earths! Violators shall be killed without mercy!” With that, his eyes shot out a chilling murderous intent.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, protected by the sages!” Lei Yu couldn’t help but laugh with a cruel grimace: “Where are they now? Are you one of them? Haha, a junior like you dares to call yourself a sage? Hahaha, inviolable holiness? Our Ironscale School will trample this place and build another branch here!”</p>
<p>After Lei Yu finished speaking, Li Qiye suddenly appeared in front of him and spread out his palm to grab Lei Yu’s head.</p>
<p>“What, what are you doing?!” Lei Yu was stunned from shock and wanted to run towards his father. However, it was too late.</p>
<p>“Rip!” His head and his spine were instantly pulled out by Li Qiye as blood spattered everywhere.</p>
<p>“No...” His head was still moving as he screamed before his imminent death.</p>
<p>“Little beast!” The schoolmaster couldn’t save his son in time and had to watch the process play out. He vomited blood from anger and cried in a furor: “Kill him! Tear him into pieces!”</p>
<p>He himself took out a saber and rushed forward.</p>
<p>“Junior, accept your death!” At this time, the elders and the other experts shouted aggressively. All of them wanted to kill Li Qiye with their numerical advantage.</p>
<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Bursts of impacts resounded, followed by the sound of bones shattering. Next came the sounds of objects falling to the ground.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster and all of the experts fell to the ground at the same time like a flower in full bloom.</p>
<p>Blood quietly flowed from their bodies and soaked the ground and stone pavement. All of this happened in complete silence.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster’s eyes were wide open. Not even in death did he know how he died. Li Qiye was too fast, they didn’t even have the opportunity to react.</p>
<p>“What…” Zhang Baitu struggled to calm down. He was quivering with fear and stumbled several steps backward. Even though he had seen killing before, this was his first time seeing such a brutal massacre.</p>
<p>Li Qiye once again sat down on the stone steps as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Hang them all on the trees.” He commanded nonchalantly: “Let the world know that the Hundred-Saints Hall is the resting place of brave spirits. No one can violate its sanctity. Some people should start remembering better!”</p>
<p>“This, this is not good, the Ironscale School will go mad.” Zhang Baitu hesitated and said: “This isn’t only provoking the school, it will be going against the entire Sea Demon Race.”</p>
<p>“You just need to listen.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “The Ironscale School and sea demons are meaningless. If the overlords of this race understand the significance of the Hundred-Saints Hall, they will tuck their tails between their legs!”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu paused for a bit before following Li Qiye’s directions and started to hang the bodies on the trees. Doing so in the most conspicuous location was truly sending a message to their enemies.</p>
<p>After taking care of business, he returned to Li Qiye’s side and asked: “What now?”</p>
<p>“What else but to destroy the Ironscale School? I stay true to my words!” Li Qiye smiled and stood up to look at the plaque of the temple.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The crow on the plaque seemed to come alive. It suddenly opened its eyes while the plaque shot out an endless light. In an instant, the plaque flew away with the momentum of an invincible cavalry.</p>
<p>“Bang!” A violent world-destroying aura instantly rushed out. It broke through the void and emerged in the sky above the Ironscale School.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?” The ancestors there were confused after sensing this invincible aura engulf their school.</p>
<p>“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic explosions occurred. The plaque underwent a great change, as if it was a gigantic armored deity descending from the sky.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The earth shook while an impossibly high tidal wave rose to the sky. The entirety of the Dragon Demon Sea was affected by the tremors.</p>
<p>The plaque carried the supreme will of an unstoppable cavalry and instantly penetrated the ancestral ground of the Ironscale School. Despite the multi-layered defensive barriers, the ancestral ground couldn’t withstand a single blow and was immediately annihilated.</p>
<p>“No!” The ancestors couldn’t help but scream after seeing the destruction of their ancestral ground. It was too late. With just one attack, the Ironscale School completely collapsed as the blood of its disciples stained the sea.</p>
<p>Many people felt this change and were astonished. Dongting Lake was the closest sect. It was alarmed as well, but no one knew what was going on.</p>
<p>The invincible will of a cavalry had crossed through the heaven and earth, causing countless creatures to tremble.</p>
<p>This commotion had startled a few truly supreme existence. In the highest location of Rainbow City, one person among the clouds suddenly stood up in shock. Their eyes illuminated the world.</p>
<p>“Which blind fool maneuvered against the Hundred-Saints Hall!” This person was moved by this development: “That is the place protected by the sages, so which idiot decided to blaspheme the brave spirits? That is simply courting death.”</p>
<p>Other sects and lineages didn’t know what was going on. It was only after a long time that these few ancient existences finally calmed down.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1235: Minor Zen School</h4>
<p>Chapter 1235: Minor Zen School</p>
<p>After a long time, an ancient existence who actually knew about what happened movingly spoke: “The Hundred-Saints Hall is the untouchable resting place of heroes. A few fools do not know and only think of it and Dongting Lake as a treasure land worth coveting. Why don’t they think about the reason it has been untouched for millions of years? Whatever, just a few fools wanting to die. My old bones do not want to join such muddy waters.”</p>
<p>After commenting, this existence went back to sleep and ignored this matter completely.</p>
<p>Back on the island, the plaque returned to the top of the temple. It was still incomparably old like before.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu had fallen to his knees from the pressure emanating from the invincible aura. It took him a long time to calm down. Nevertheless, he was still stunned. Not even in his dreams would he have thought that this old plaque of the hall carried such power.</p>
<p>Eventually, he stood up and looked at it while stammering: “This, this thing is…”</p>
<p>He took half a day, yet he couldn’t enunciate a whole sentence clearly. [1. Half a day is an expression, he didn’t actually stammer for 12 hours.]</p>
<p>“You still don’t understand? The wise sages protecting the hall does not refer to me.” Li Qiye flatly said: “They are the spirits of the Zhang, Xu, and Hong Clans, answering the call once more.”</p>
<p>“Spirits?” Zhang Baitu was dazed for a moment.</p>
<p>“Your ancestors were benevolent, broad-minded, and brave. They were not the most powerful of their generation, but many Godkings still admired them. This was not because of their achievements or strength, but because of their magnanimous and pious minds on top of being very loyal. These characteristics are worthy of admiration, as precious as gold and jade.” With that, he looked at Zhang Baitu and continued: “But as for their unfilial descendants, look at what they have done. Turning on each other for petty power, cutting off all ties. When your ancestors stood at the peak to look down on the world, they still didn't think about competing for power! How can you all not be ashamed with them watching you from above?!”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was unable to calm down. He imagined the scenes when the three clans struggled together. He saw them in one camp, not abandoning each other even in the face of death…</p>
<p>“You will follow me for now.” Li Qiye commanded: “Go tidy up your belongings, I will go on ahead. Wait for me in Rainbow City.”</p>
<p>After issuing the command, he pointed at the air and created a portal, leaving instantly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhang Baitu stood there absentmindedly. After a long time, he eventually calmed down yet still felt like this was a dream before going to pack his things.</p>
<p>There were many islands outside of Dongting Lake. Of course, they couldn’t compare to the lake whether in size or resources.</p>
<p>Among them, the Minor Zen School could be considered a powerful lineage with five islands. Their entire ancestral ground was built on these five landmasses.</p>
<p>The Minor Zen School was fairly far from Dongting Lake. It was established by humans as well and only consisted of humans cultivators. This gave it a bit of fame in the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
<p>There was a guest today who specifically wanted to meet its schoolmaster. If it was any other sect, it wouldn’t be so simple to see a schoolmaster like this. After all, it was a prestigious position, not just anyone could see them.</p>
<p>However, the Minor Zen School was a relatively small lineage. Their schoolmaster didn’t put on airs; after hearing that a young human wanted to see him, a personal reception was in order.</p>
<p>In the room, he and the guest sat down before he finally looked at this young man. It was a very normal-looking person with no semblance of a master.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being the leader of a small sect he trod very carefully, regardless of who he might be talking to.</p>
<p>“May I have your name?” Eventually, he cupped his fists in greeting.</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” It turned out that after leaving the hall, he went straight for the Minor Zen School.</p>
<p>His purpose was to find out more information on Su Yonghuang.</p>
<p>After hearing the name “Li Qiye”, the schoolmaster immediately stood up and respectfully cupped his fists again: “So it is Young Noble Li from Peacock Land. Excuse me, this lowly one has eyes yet failed to see Mt. Tai. Please forgive us.”</p>
<p>As a leader, he had his own intelligence channels, especially regarding news that related to the human race. The story of Li Qiye sacrificing a billion Teeming Fish for the Peacock Tree had also spread to the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was satisfied with the schoolmaster’s attitude and nodded.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster didn’t expect the successor of the Peacock Tree to come to the Dragon Demon Sea. He was quite surprised and emotionally spoke: “Young Noble Li, you are the great disciple of the Peacock Tree and will be the master of Peacock Land in this generation. It looks like the human race will continue to have a sanctuary in the Heaven Spirit World.”</p>
<p>Many people considered Li Qiye to be the tree controller or even a disciple of the Peacock Tree.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t bother correcting this misunderstanding. He nodded and said: “I didn’t come today for anything relating to Peacock Land. I only want to ask about a woman that has been here.”</p>
<p>“You must be asking about Miss Su?” The schoolmaster thought about a certain person after hearing this.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and nodded again: “Yes, I want to know what you gave her.”</p>
<p>The schoolmaster trembled internally. He hesitated and spoke unwillingly: “Well, it is not that I don’t trust you, but this relates to someone else’s personal business.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I know her better than you. We are from the same sect.” Li Qiye flatly said: “But I can still make a guess even if you don’t tell me since it looks like you’re not completely human.”</p>
<p>The schoolmaster was shocked to hear this: “What do you mean, Young Noble?”</p>
<p>“You know what I’m talking about.” Li Qiye smilingly said: “The bloodline of the Undying Gate flows through you. Even though it is very faint, its mark is indelible. It’s only just that the bloodline marking of Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s clan would be extraordinary.”</p>
<p>The master took several steps backward and stared at Li Qiye in horror. Outsiders shouldn’t know such things, yet Li Qiye was able to see through it with his all-piercing eyes.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster calmed down and sat back in his chair before wryly smiling: “Your insight is wonderful. This lowly one won’t hide it anymore.”</p>
<p>He sighed and continued: “You are right, one of my female ancestors was indeed from the Undying Gate. After its decline, she married her husband here at the Dragon Demon Sea.”</p>
<p>“She also brought some items from the Undying Gate to this place.” Li Qiye speculated. The thing he was curious about was how the ancestor from the Su Clan had a connection with the Undying Gate.</p>
<p>“A few treasures.” The schoolmaster admitted: “But none of them are particularly incredible.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and gently shook his head: “Don’t worry, I’m not here for treasures. Plus, if I wanted treasures from the Undying Gate, I wouldn’t have come here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, there is a misunderstanding.” The schoolmaster hurriedly smiled in response: “She brought along a few items in her dowry that have been used up long ago. If I had a world-shattering treasure, the Minor Zen School wouldn’t be a small lineage right now.”</p>
<p>“Then what did you give Miss Su?” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
<p>“A map.” To which the schoolmaster responded: “But it is not a treasure map or anything. It is a very strange map with no use. If it wasn’t for Miss Su bringing the other half of the map with her, I wouldn’t have known that it was half of a map in the first place. She had to have it, so she paid an exorbitant amount of refined jades for it.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye casually asked: “What kind of map is it?”</p>
<p>The schoolmaster revealed a wry smile and said: “To tell the truth, I don’t know what kind of map it is either. It was thrown into a corner at home and no one has ever looked at it before. After Miss Su brought the other half here, I finally remembered it. After she received the other half, I also took a quick look. It is a very strange map, I couldn’t make heads or tails of it.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it is definitely not an art for eternal life.” In the end, he added this sentence lest Li Qiye have some misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Li Qiye burst into laughter: “I know what you mean. Rest assured, I am not here for the art of immortality. If such an item could fall into your hands so easily, countless people for the past millions of years wouldn’t have been searching for it. It’s not something you can possess.”</p>
<p>“Your keen insight is worthy of admiration.” The schoolmaster became relieved after hearing this. He didn’t want Li Qiye to think that he once had the art of immortality.</p>
<p>If this news were to spread, then a disaster would befall their school.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your time, goodbye.” After his inquiries, he understood that the schoolmaster had limited knowledge, so there was no need to pry further.</p>
<p>In fact, he was not in a rush to find Su Yonghuang. As long as she wasn’t in any danger, he was fine with it. He was only curious about what she actually did to make even the skeletal horse of Immortal Emperor Bu Si start running outside.</p>
<p>Of course, he also knew that the collapse of the Immortal Emperor back then wasn’t so simple. Otherwise, the emperor wouldn’t have left some cautionary measures.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster enthusiastically asked: “If you don’t mind, can you stay in our humble abode for a few days?” Li Qiye was the successor of the Peacock Tree. In the future, he could become a leader for the human race in the Heaven Spirit World, thus the schoolmaster wanted to befriend Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head. He glanced at the master and casually took out a wooden box: “Thank you for your hospitality. This is a greeting gift, goodbye for now.”</p>
<p>The master was taken aback. He accepted the wooden box and whiffed a medicinal fragrance. He looked up to say: “Young Noble, you are too polite…”</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster eventually calmed down and opened the wooden box. He was astounded and stumbled several steps backward while unable to believe his eyes: “One million year old Blood Ginseng!”</p>
<p>This truly frightened him because it was just a greeting gift. How extravagant was this? It wasn’t an item he would even dare to think about.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave it to him due to his honesty. If he wasn’t someone who took pride in being a schoolmaster, Li Qiye wouldn’t have given him the gift.</p>
<p>After the schoolmaster calmed down, he quickly put it away. Such an item could bring about a sect-ending disaster for them if others were to find out.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1236: Rainbow Island</h4>
<p>Chapter 1236: Rainbow Island</p>
<p>If Dongting Lake was a jewel before the dragon mountain, then Rainbow City was situated by the very end of its tail.</p>
<p>The tail of the mountain range was dotted with many islands like the stars in the sky. All of them were quite small yet exquisite. The inhabitants here used the trees in the surroundings to build pretty little houses.</p>
<p>At the mountain range and Rainbow City, people usually brought up another lineage, one that was very mysterious in the Heaven Spirit World — the Giant Dragon Kingdom.</p>
<p>Some believed that it indeed existed while others denied this claim. Who knows the truth in this matter? According to the legends, the ancestor of the kingdom was the Giant Dragon God. The existence of this deity was widely accepted, unlike the kingdom.</p>
<p>It was considered the apex existence of the sea demons. After dying, its huge body turned into the current Giant Dragon Mountain Range. From then on, its descendants prospered and populated this area. The kingdom was also established by them within the depths of the range.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the kingdom’s location and characteristics were still mysteries to outsiders. However, one could find some traces of this kingdom at Rainbow City. Some said that this city was a window of the Giant Dragon Kingdom. It was purposely established as an outreach towards the secular world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Rainbow Islands were only the beginning of the city itself. One must go through the islands before being able to reach the city.</p>
<p>Li Qiye entered one island and faintly smiled while staring at the sky. A series of islands appeared before him with people coming and going. Humans, sea demons, and treants — all of these cultivators were only stopping by for a bit before attempting to enter the actual Rainbow City.</p>
<p>He saw a carriage going through this island. It was very extravagant and its body was made from the precious metals of the Profound Dynasty. Eight different compartments spewed out water that paved a path in the sky so that the carriage could move forward even faster.</p>
<p>Eight of the rarest phoenix-steeds in the Heaven Spirit World were pulling this luxurious ride. Scintillating lights accompanied them and made it seem like their owner was a deity on patrol.</p>
<p>Many pretty maids were behind the carriage while younger servants were throwing flowers next to the carriage. Wherever it was on its path, the surrounding ten miles would be filled with fluttering flowers. It was the most ostentatious showing of wealth and nobility.</p>
<p>Not too many people would put on such an overbearing posture in the Heaven Spirit World. Most importantly, the majority of cultivators did not pursue this type of luxury, so this type of lavish travel was quite rare.</p>
<p>It also easily attracted jealousy and even trouble from others. However, the master of this carriage probably never spared a thought for such a problem.</p>
<p>In fact, the moment people saw the little flag on the carriage, they quickly gave way, let alone cause trouble. They knew that this was the banner of the Profound God-Monarch. Only those closest to him were allowed to use this banner.</p>
<p>A cultivator murmured: “Gongsun Meiyu is here.”</p>
<p>His friend reminded him: “Shh, quiet down. You better call her Queen Gongsun. I heard people from the Abyss Sea say that she likes being called queen the most. Otherwise, she might randomly kill people if she is in a bad mood.”</p>
<p>People had different emotions while looking at this luxurious carriage. Some were awed while others were envious, but regardless of what they felt the most common reaction was to retreat.</p>
<p>Gongsun Meiyu was a concubine of the Profound God-Monarch and was known to have earned his favor. Rumor has it that she might even be promoted from concubine to wife, the new queen of the Profound Dynasty.</p>
<p>In fact, she didn’t only rely on her beauty to win his love. Before marrying him, she had already been famous among the younger generation of charming spirits. Her cultivation was very powerful as she was once a prodigy.</p>
<p>Someone speculated: “If Queen Gongsun is here, maybe the monarch is on his way as well?”</p>
<p>His companion quietly replied: “Don’t speak carelessly. I heard Queen Gongsun is very grumpy right now. Her favorite maid was killed by a kid named Li Qiye. She is probably on a trip to feel better, or maybe she is trying to find that kid.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored the carriage. He entered an inn and quietly drank, waiting for Zhang Baitu to come.</p>
<p>He quietly sighed while gazing outside the inn to look at the ocean as well as the faint dragon mountain range in the distance.</p>
<p>In fact, many resting cultivators were gazing at it as well.</p>
<p>A cultivator asked his friend sitting next to him: “Are there really dragons in those mountains? Or rather, does such a race truly exist in this world?”</p>
<p>An older elder pondered for a moment regarding this question before answering: “That would depend on how you define the dragon race. Whether they exist in those mountains or not is difficult to say. However, dragon demons indeed exist in the Heaven Spirit World. They are supreme among our Sea Demon Race. Some ancestors believe that the dragons in there are part of the sea dragon demons as well.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of dragons, I have heard of a certain legend.” A friend at the same table added: “A very long time ago, a little black dragon used to play around these mountains and this sea region. It swam through the Rainbow Islands, but who knows if it is real or not.”</p>
<p>Another friend happily joined in: “I’ve heard about that too. This little black dragon caused a lot of trouble at Dongting Lake. Later on, it was subdued by an immortal.”</p>
<p>The cultivator that initiated the conversation became quite curious and quickly asked: “Immortal? A real immortal?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably just a fairy tale. Where can you find immortals in this world?” The elder smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>One of the friends added: “I heard a version that is a little different. It says that the person who subdued the little black dragon was not an immortal at all, it was a heinous devil king. After this devil king took down the dragon, he skinned it and drank its blood before boiling the meat and eating it.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye, who was sitting in a corner, almost spat out his wine. Some rumors kept on spreading and eventually, the tale became completely different.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t really mind this small talk. He gently smiled and stopped listening.</p>
<p>After a good while, Zhang Baitu finally arrived. He saw Li Qiye and quickly bowed. Li Qiye nodded and signaled for him to sit down.</p>
<p>“You are late.” Li Qiye casually spoke while drinking and enjoying the scenery outside.</p>
<p>“Something happened that slowed me down a bit, just a small matter.” Zhang Baitu smiled awkwardly while rubbing his palms.</p>
<p>Li Qiye slightly frowned and asked: “Someone came looking for trouble?”</p>
<p>“No, no—” Zhang Baitu saw Li Qiye’s expression and his soul almost left his body. He quickly waved his hands to deny the claim.</p>
<p>But how could a little character like him withstand Li Qiye’s glare? He eventually gave up with a bitter face: “Young Noble, really, it is no big deal. Because of the big commotion earlier, the disciples from Dongting Lake were afraid that something had happened to me, so they came asking questions, that’s all. They really didn’t trouble me at all, really.”</p>
<p>In his eyes, Li Qiye was definitely not a good-natured person. A single discordant conversation could lead to a bloodbath. He probably belonged to the type of people who would kill as many provokers as possible. Because of this, he was afraid that Li Qiye would misunderstand and kill the disciples from the lake. He would never be able to forgive himself if that were to happen.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave him a quick glance before shifting his gaze towards the mountains.</p>
<p>After seeing Li Qiye no longer pressing the issue, Zhang Baitu finally felt relieved. He thought about back then when the disciples saw the corpses that were hung on the trees. How could they not be frightened?</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t want these disciples to provoke Li Qiye, it would be the same as courting death.</p>
<p>He eventually gathered his courage and softly asked: “Young, Young Noble, where are we going now?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and replied: “To Rainbow City to grab a few things for you. We have to prepare certain things in order to destroy your dao foundation and start over.”</p>
<p>“Destroy my dao foundation?” The old man was startled after hearing this. Even though his foundation was very shallow, it was still the fruit of several dozen hard-fought years. He couldn’t accept this so quickly.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and said: “There is nothing to feel lost about. I’m not trying to belittle you, but your dao foundation is as good as not having anything at all — it’s completely dispensable. Destroy to rebuild from the beginning — this is the way to go.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu had to admit that his foundation was indeed lacking and dispensable.</p>
<p>He asked with some concern: “But I’m not young anymore, can I handle it?” He was quite old already. Destroying the foundation at his age could easily lead to exhaustion, he’d croak for sure.</p>
<p>Li Qiye casually replied: “Don’t worry. With me here, it would be difficult for you to die even if you wanted to.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll do as you say, Young Noble.” He made a decision after a moment of hesitation. In his eyes, Li Qiye had no need to harm him. If he did, just one finger was enough to take care of him, there was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1237: Hong Yujiao</h4>
<p>Chapter 1237: Hong Yujiao</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave a nod and continued to look at the hazy mountain range in silence.</p>
<p>This Giant Dragon Mountain Range stretched for ten million miles like a dragon lying on the ocean. It was completely engulfed in mist and fog; a dragon with a visible head yet indiscernible tail. This made the whole area even more mysterious. [1. This idiom was used before and is slightly modified here. It means magnificent/unfathomable.]</p>
<p>Unwittingly, his vision of the mountains turned a bit hazy during this long observation. Who knows if it was his eyes becoming blurry or the mountain range itself losing definition?</p>
<p>He became absent-minded for a long time. Some unwanted memories resurfaced and his heart jumped as if it was being clutched by something.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu quietly sat there and didn’t say anything after noticing Li Qiye’s intense stare.</p>
<p>“Young Noble.” Eventually, Li Qiye’s expression became very strange, prompting him to ask: “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was startled and regained his wits. He gently sighed and lightly replied: “It’s nothing. It is only that the mountain range is too incredible. A few things from there are truly unforgettable.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu misunderstood him and scratched his head while agreeing: “Right, this mountain range has always been incredibly enchanting. It is extremely mysterious, so it invokes curiosity from just about anyone. They all want to know if the Giant Dragon Kingdom truly exists or not…”</p>
<p>“... But no one has ever been able to verify this. According to legend, unless they were granted permission from the kingdom, no one would be able to get in there. There have been many attempts to enter it, but none were publicly successful. Do you want to go there for a look too?” He thought that Li Qiye wanted to enter the mountain range, but Li Qiye was actually thinking about something else.</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Li Qiye only smiled and casually asked: “How is the Jian Clan right now?”</p>
<p>“Are you referring to the Jian Clan from Rainbow City?” Despite being a nobody, Zhang Baitu still knew a few things about Rainbow City due to how close it was.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded. His mind was a little unfocused.</p>
<p>“The Jian Clan is still doing very well in Rainbow City. Everyone says that they are the number one clan there.” Zhang Baitu told Li Qiye everything he knew: “I heard they are very close with the human race. Some also say that they are related to the Giant Dragon Kingdom. It is a relatively low-key clan, but we all know just how powerful they are. The Jian Clanmaster has lived for several thousand years, but he is still as vigorous as ever.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye remained impassive after hearing this, but he was sighing on the inside. The brat from the Jian Clan was still alive. Unfortunately, he didn’t want to face it…</p>
<p>The Heaven Spirit World was not a place that he wanted to visit either. There were many memories that he preferred to be forgotten.</p>
<p>During his silence, a woman wearing a tight green outfit arrived outside the inn. Her curvy figure contrasted her cold and determined demeanor. This was Hong Yujiao who met Li Qiye back at Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was surprised to see her. Meanwhile, she immediately came over when she saw him and cupped her fists: “Senior Brother Zhang, long time no see.”</p>
<p>Although Zhang Baitu was not a disciple of the lake, in accordance with their ancestors’ hierarchy, Hong Yujiao still needed to call him senior brother.</p>
<p>“Ah, Sister Hong, long time no see. Your cultivation has increased yet again.” Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and turned away with the intention of blocking Li Qiye from her view. He didn’t want her to see Li Qiye.</p>
<p>He was not worried for Li Qiye but rather Hong Yujiao’s safety because he could faintly guess why she came to this place.</p>
<p>It was of no use because she had spotted Li Qiye and spoke with a hint of surprise: “It’s you?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was still contemplating while looking at the mountain range, so he didn’t hear her.</p>
<p>She didn’t like his attitude, but this was not Dongting Lake. She didn’t want to make it difficult for him since she came for Zhang Baitu.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Baitu, he lamented in his mind. He knew that this was unavoidable and only wished for Hong Yujiao to mind her words.</p>
<p>“Brother, I was entrusted by my father to ask you about a few things.” She sat down and looked at him in a serious manner.</p>
<p>Her father was the current Dongting Lakemaster, Hong Tianzhu.</p>
<p>“About what?” He asked quickly, despite knowing full well what she wanted to talk about. This was the matter he didn’t want her to mention the most.</p>
<p>She said: “I heard some news about people from the Ironscale School coming to cause trouble for you.”</p>
<p>True to his expectations, he tried to divert the subject: “Oh, about that? It’s over now. They wanted to buy my Hundred-Saints Hall, but how could I sell the ancestors’ home? So I said no.”</p>
<p>She softly said: “What happened on the island then? Brother, this is no small matter.” This was not an attempt to blame or interrogate him, she needed to know the truth of this big event.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a divine aura suppressed the entire Demon Dragon Sea. Next, news of the destruction of the Ironscale School spread. A bit later, Dongting Lake found out that the corpses of the Ironscale Schoolmaster and more than one hundred of his followers were hanging at the Hundred-Saints Hall. How could the lake not be startled by this?</p>
<p>Of course, they didn’t connect the aura that destroyed the Ironscale School with the hall. However, it was still a big deal when those corpses were located on that island. After all, their lake was a prime suspect to these deaths.</p>
<p>In fact, after finding out, they disposed of those bodies. Zhang Baitu didn’t dare to let Li Qiye know since he was afraid that Li Qiye would become angry and make his way in to destroy the lake.</p>
<p>“Well…” Zhang Baitu didn’t know how to respond. He was not someone who was good at lying, so he coughed and said: “Well, the responsibility does not fall on us. It was the Ironscale School forcing a sale.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and slowly said: “Why make such a big deal out of something so trivial like destroying an Ironscale School?”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was alarmed. He was not worried about himself, he was afraid that Hong Yujiao would provoke Li Qiye. His shallow cultivation did not blind his vision, he knew that Hong Yujiao had learned the arts of her father, but she was nothing before Li Qiye. She would be crushed by just one of his fingers.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao’s expression changed as she looked at Li Qiye with a stern look and asked: “May I have your name?”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu wanted to say something, but he refrained from doing so. Li Qiye looked back at her and smiled: “My name doesn’t matter. I just want to say that your Dongting Lake is becoming worse with each successive generation, losing sight of the grand picture just for petty gains in power.”</p>
<p>He laughed and continued: “Look at your lake now. Unlike your ancestors who protected the vitality of the human race, you’re now just a bunch of cowards hiding in the city. All of their glory has been thrown away by your generation.”</p>
<p>“Today, you have even forgotten about the souls of your ancestors as well as your spiritual totem. I’m curious, how many years has it been since the last time your lake went to worship the Hundred-Saints Hall? Has it been fifty or a hundred generations? I’m afraid that your lake has even forgotten who the ones enshrined in the hall are.” With that, he sighed and didn’t want to look at her anymore.</p>
<p>She couldn’t answer due to lacking knowledge about this matter. She only knew that some ancestors from the lake speculated that the Hundred-Saints Hall might be storing some treasures.</p>
<p>“We descendants are not qualified to comment on the matter of our ancestors.” Eventually, she answered: “I just want to ask you, did you kill the Ironscale Schoolmaster’s group?”</p>
<p>This was the thing she was most concerned about. After all, the schoolmaster and elders of a sea demon lineage had died very close to Dongting Lake, and even their sect was destroyed. Once this news spread, their lake would become the prime suspect.</p>
<p>Of course, she understood that Zhang Baitu couldn’t kill that group, so the only possibility was this person sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>“I understand your lake’s intention.” Li Qiye smiled: “It needs to find a murderer in order to wash away this suspicion.”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1238: Scolding</h4>
<p>Chapter 1238: Scolding</p>
<p>She maintained her calm despite his accusation and lowered her tone: “This is a serious matter, so our Dongting Lake will get to the very bottom of it.”</p>
<p>“Get to the bottom of it?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “When the Ironscale School bullied Zhang Baitu, when they tried to force him to sell the Hundred-Saints Hall, where was your lake then? And now, during the aftermath, your lake is trying to steer clear of anything to do with this event. Quite interesting…”</p>
<p>“Well…” Zhang Baitu softly spoke: “Young Noble, this really isn’t the lake’s fault. I didn’t tell them at all.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and waved his sleeve: “You don’t have to speak up for them, I know full well what is going on. You don’t have to tell me that the lake has disposed of the bodies either.”</p>
<p>“I…” Zhang Baitu was scared. He didn’t expect Li Qiye to predict it this fast, so he had no response.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao answered instead: “Brother Zhang is not at fault, this was the lake’s decision and it has nothing to do with him.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Li Qiye slowly turned towards Hong Yujiao and smiled: “This is more like it, spoken like a family.”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and stared at him: “With all due respect, this is not a joke, I hope you can clarify this matter or the sea demons in this region will put this on Dongting Lake. At that time, the lake will be isolated from the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>“Isolated from the world?” Li Qiye laughed: ”This kind of thing will never happen. Kill thirty to fifty of someone’s men and they will swear to never share this sky with you again. But if you kill a billion of them, they will obediently tuck their tails between their legs. Those who are unconvinced will have their bones litter the ground!”</p>
<p>His eyes turned cold at this point: “I am not someone who agrees with using force to bully the weak, and I will not condone any immoral acts from my followers. However, those who dare to provoke me or harm my followers, regardless of whether they are strong or weak, will be killed before talking about who was right and wrong! Only when you use blood to talk will others understand where your bottom line is. Otherwise, people will think that you are an easy target, and they will bully you while thinking that the humans in the Heaven Spirit World are mere ants.”</p>
<p>“It is a pity that your group did not inherit the hot blood of your ancestors or their willingness to kill!” He continued on with indifference: “Your lake is willing to sacrifice Zhang Baitu to separate itself from this situation, maybe you would even give up the Hundred-Saints Hall altogether. As long as the interests of your lake are untouched, everything can be negotiated.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu trembled after hearing the line about killing all those who opposed you and answering with blood. It truly touched his heart.</p>
<p>“We do not have those intentions.” Despite being unable to refute all of Li Qiye’s accusations, Hong Yujiao still said: “We don’t want to turn Brother Zhang into a shield, our goal is to find out the truth so that others won’t misconstrue the situation.”</p>
<p>“Misconstrue?” Li Qiye laughed sarcastically and said: “So what if they misunderstand? The Ironscale School and outsiders are nothing. Who needs them to understand things clearly? So what if they don’t? You can’t even protect the spirits of your ancestors and have even forgotten their creed, yet you care about the misunderstandings of outsiders? The damned geezers at Dongting Lake have lost their minds!”</p>
<p>“Sir, I hope you can be more careful with your words. Dongting Lake has our own principles, and we shall do what we must.” She didn’t back down in response: “We are grateful for you saving Brother Zhang, but if you keep on insulting Dongting Lake, don’t blame me for no longer being polite!”</p>
<p>“Sister—” Zhang Baitu jumped up from his chair and dragged her away: “Sister, you now understand the situation so go back and report this to the sect master.” He winked at her.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to see a fight between the two of them since her fate would be the same as the ones from the Ironscale School — instantly crushed by Li Qiye!</p>
<p>“Baitu—” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “There’s no need to be so sneaky around me. If I wanted to kill her, she wouldn’t have been able to talk in front of me. The same goes for Dongting Lake; if I wanted to trouble them, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu awkwardly let go of her and wryly smiled: “Young Noble, she isn’t trying to annoy you. She is only nervous about protecting Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>“If I was annoyed with her, I wouldn’t have let her speak.” Li Qiye glared at him. The old man coughed and didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>Li Qiye shifted his attention towards the girl and said: “I’m the killer, your lake can go ahead and reveal it if you want to be rid of suspicion. Tell those brainless geezers to stop being short-sighted all day long and fixated on trivial matters. They have forgotten who their ancestors are and their own surnames for a few benefits!”</p>
<p>“You…” She glared at him. After all, he was directly scolding her elders. No one could swallow such anger.</p>
<p>“Sister, go already, the master is waiting for your news.” Zhang Baitu dragged her away and motioned for her to quickly leave.</p>
<p>She managed to restrain herself and coldly looked at Li Qiye: “I won’t interfere with your disrespectful behavior, but if you insult Dongting Lake again, I will definitely deal with you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored her and focused on his drinks.</p>
<p>She eventually left, brewing with indignation. If it wasn’t for Zhang Baitu pulling her back, she would have definitely fought this arrogant person!</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was in a difficult position after she left. He rubbed his palms and smiled: “Young Noble, Sister Hong is a very good person. The only thing is that she can be very straightforward at times.”</p>
<p>Even though their ancestors had grievances, this generation got along with each other. This was especially true for Hong Yujiao and himself. They were quite close, so he couldn’t watch her go to her death. Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>After a long time, Li Qiye looked at the faint mountain range one last time and decided to pay the bill. He looked over at Zhang Baitu and said: “Come, we’ll go to Rainbow City.”</p>
<p>The two of them left the inn to go to the ferry. Everyone had to use this particular type of fish as transportation before they could reach Rainbow City.</p>
<p>Once they got to the ferry, the sky suddenly turned dark. A gigantic ship descended from the sky, its size too immense to describe. Half of its hull was still hidden in the clouds, so no one could see it fully.</p>
<p>This gigantic warship appearing at Rainbow Island attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Many people saw the conch insignia on the warship and became quite surprised. Someone asked: “Is that the Roaring Conch?”</p>
<p>An old man slowly answered: “No, this isn’t it. It might be the ship of a big character from there though.”</p>
<p>Another person speculated after seeing the ship: “Is it the Seashield Prince then?”</p>
<p>The insignia of the Roaring Conch left many spectators shocked. This was a famous lineage throughout the entire Heaven Spirit World, not just limited to the Dragon Demon Sea. They had two sea gods that possessed the Trident for a very long time. According to the tales, the moment their conch blared, all of the sea demons in the world would answer its call.</p>
<p>A smaller ship flew out of the big warship. In fact, this smaller vessel was still quite sizable. It just seemed tiny in comparison to its huge friend.</p>
<p>The warship didn’t stop after the second one came out. It slowly rose to the sky and disappeared towards the horizon, towards an unknown destination.</p>
<p>The smaller one landed. Many saw a woman standing at the bow. She basked in the wind with her hair fluttering about.</p>
<p>Her pretty eyes and nose were more than enough to describe her as beautiful. Her fair white skin had a hint of rouge. Such a beauty would command attention wherever she went. Her waist was especially slender; it was as if a gust of wind could make it dance.</p>
<p>Despite her delicate appearance, she exuded a terrifying aura befitting of a God-Monarch! Halos emerged from her body. Each of them seemed to be part of their own world while carrying infinite power.</p>
<p>Many were frightened to see this force. After all, she was an incredibly young God-Monarch.</p>
<p>“Wow, a God-Monarch…” Zhang Baitu was in awe and felt quite envious after seeing the God-Monarch’s halos.</p>
<p>He had cultivated for a lifetime, yet his cultivation was completely negligible. However, this young lady ahead was already a horrifying God-Monarch. How could people not be stunned into admiration before this scene?</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1239: Rainbow Fish</h4>
<p>Chapter 1239: Rainbow Fish</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Baitu was not the only one who was envious. Many people had the same stunned expression while looking at her.</p>
<p>“Shangguan Feiyan, the junior sister of the Seashield Prince. Rumor has it that she is already an Intermediate God-Monarch, what a magnificent goddess.” A young cultivator stared at her in admiration but became gloomy when comparing himself to her.</p>
<p>God-Monarch was only a title. In fact, experts at the Virtuous Deity level were eligible to be called God-Monarchs.</p>
<p>There were different levels of this particular title. Cultivators generally divided them into five levels: Minor Monarch, Intermediate Monarch, Grand Monarch, True Monarch, and Bestowed Monarch. [1. Note, they are all God-Monarch in the raw, but that makes it even longer and these titles will be repeated a lot, so I’m removing the God part for now unless the text requires it to make sense.]</p>
<p>There wasn’t a need to explain the levels of Minor, Intermediate, and Grand Monarchs. In fact, some God-Monarchs from the previous generations didn’t think that these levels were necessary. Some even held them in contempt and thought that these three levels only consisted of false God-Monarchs. This was because although they had reached the level of Virtuous Deity, they couldn’t understand the true profundities of this realm.</p>
<p>Of course, a few called themselves “God-Monarch” even before reaching the Virtuous Deity realm. These were the real pretenders.</p>
<p>True Monarch, for many people, was the true baseline of this realm. Individuals of this realm not only understood the mysteries of the Virtuous Deity realm, they could also create their own kingdom and climb up the divine investiture platform to accept the blood energy of their citizens.</p>
<p>For the older experts, only True Monarchs could exert the real power of this realm and were eligible to fight against the world itself.</p>
<p>As for Bestowed Monarchs, needless to say, these were the top existences among the Virtuous Deities. They were normally bestowed the title by an Immortal Emperor and have gone on expeditions around the nine worlds. This was the type to have experienced countless baptisms of blood and sharpening from battlefields.</p>
<p>Even though real experts looked down on the first three levels and considered them fake, Shangguan Feiyan was still an Intermediate Monarch at such a young age, so she was powerful and impressive enough.</p>
<p>“The Roaring Conch is worthy of being one of the strongest sea demon lineages. They have more than just the Seashield Prince among the younger generation, there’s Shangguan Feiyan as well.” A sect master was amazed to see her.</p>
<p>She was a young genius from the Roaring Conch with great aptitudes. She knew that there was still quite a gap between her and her senior brother, the Seashield Prince, so she chose the path of the grand era instead. She was determined to become a top Godking instead of competing for the heaven’s path with her senior brother.</p>
<p>At this time, many people were lined up for the ferry to go to Rainbow City. After arriving, Shangguan Feiyan didn’t try to cut the line and stood there just like everyone else.</p>
<p>“The two of you, eh? It will be ten Ancient Saint Jades for each.” An old man standing by the entrance saw two extravagantly dressed young men and named the price. It looked like these two were from great powers.</p>
<p>This old man was the only person watching over the entrance. He wore a gray robe and had an ordinary appearance; nothing particularly stood out.</p>
<p>One of the two youths wasn’t happy to hear this, so he complained: “Ten Ancient Saint Jades for each person is too outrageous. That person earlier heading for Dragonwell City only paid a single Heaven’s Mandate Jade. We are going to Dragonhark City, yet you are asking for ten Ancient Saint Jades? What kind of tolls are these? I know that Dragonwell is the first stop and Dragonhark is the second stop, but why is this second stop ridiculously more expensive than the first?” The youth was very indignant. They came from a great power and had great statuses, so they weren’t lambs to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>The old man was unmoved. He didn’t bother to even look at them as he arrogantly said: “I’ll collect the fees how I see fit. If you don’t like it, don’t come to Rainbow City.”</p>
<p>He had an unperturbed demeanor, as if he didn’t mind other people coming to cause trouble.</p>
<p>The youth’s friend immediately pulled his sleeve and whispered: “This is the rule of Rainbow City, the fees are arbitrary without a clear criterion.”</p>
<p>“Are the two of you coming or not? Scram to the side if you aren’t, don’t get in the way of the people behind you.” The old man impolitely waved his hand as if he was swatting flies away.</p>
<p>The friend immediately placed refined jades into the old man’s hand and hastily said: “We’re going, we’re going.”</p>
<p>The old man whistled. With a splashing sound, two rainbow fish jumped out from the water. He waved his hand again at the two youths: “Go on.”</p>
<p>This so-called ferry was, in fact, a large well. It had clear water with no bottom in sight. Who knew how deep this well actually was?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rainbow fish resembled gigantic goldfish. The main difference was that they also had a tail with seven colors.</p>
<p>The youths quickly jumped on the fish. With a pop, the two fish each spat out a large bubble. The youths began to fly with these bubbles and disappeared right away. This was the way to Dragonhark City.</p>
<p>The old man said: “Next.”</p>
<p>Another boarded the ferry and busily stated: “I want to go to Dragonhark City as well.”</p>
<p>The old man glanced at him and replied: “Three Inner Longevity Jades.”</p>
<p>The person immediately paid the fee without complaint and the old man called for another rainbow fish to take him away.</p>
<p>Cultivators boarded the ferry of Rainbow City one after another. This old man’s pricing had no standard at all. He asked for however much he wanted while the people wanting to reach the end of Rainbow City obediently paid the price.</p>
<p>No one dared to cause trouble. There had been tales of people trying to fight against members of Rainbow City being thrown away very far. Among them, one person needed to fly several hundred years before returning to their home.</p>
<p>After a good while, it was finally time for Shangguan Feiyan’s ship. She stood at the bow and said: “The entire ship to Dragonhark.”</p>
<p>“The whole ship?” He looked at the ship and began to count with his fingers: “A ship of this size requires one hundred rainbow fish. There will be a fee added for labor as well as an entry fee to the city, docking fee and protection fee…”</p>
<p>The old man counted a whole bunch of fees and went all out: “30,000 Prosperous Era Paragon Jades.”</p>
<p>Many people were tongue-tied after hearing this price. This was practically extortion. The majority would never be able to earn this many jades in their entire lifetime. Even a great power wouldn’t necessarily be willing to pay so much to enter the city.</p>
<p>However, she came from the wealthy Roaring Conch; she handed the payment over to the old man without batting an eye.</p>
<p>He whistled again and one hundred rainbow fish emerged. He commanded: “Go.”</p>
<p>The fish immediately pulled the ship away. To see this many fish drag away such a huge ship with their bubbles was quite a spectacular scene.</p>
<p>More time passed, it was finally Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu’s turn. Baitu was only following Li Qiye since he didn’t know which station they were going to.</p>
<p>“Dragonhark.” Li Qiye smiled while looking at the old man.</p>
<p>“You? Free.” The old man looked at Zhang Baitu and then turned to look at Li Qiye: “And as for you, thirty Virtuous Paragon Jades.”</p>
<p>“We, we’re together.” Zhang Baitu was anxious for Li Qiye after hearing the price. In his eyes, thirty Virtuous Paragon Jades was an astronomical figure! He wouldn’t be able to gather this much in his entire life.</p>
<p>“30.” The old man didn’t care at all; it was as if he didn’t hear Zhang Baitu.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and handed a black pouch over to the old man. The old man didn’t bother looking at it before putting it away in his chest pocket, then he whistled for two fish.</p>
<p>The two jumped on the fish as they blew their bubbles and disappeared. By the time the bubbles disappeared, allowing the two to see again, they had already fallen into a huge ancient city. This was their destination, Dragonhark.</p>
<p>Dragonhark was the first stop of Rainbow City. In fact, Rainbow City was only a general term, it didn’t mean that it only consisted of one city. On the contrary, it was the general designation for everything here, including these cities and stops.</p>
<p>Many believed that Rainbow City gained its name because all of these stops required the riding of the Rainbow Fish’s bubbles to reach them.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that Dragonhark City was named after Dragonhark Valley. The validity of this claim remains unknown.</p>
<p>Dragonhark City was enormous. While standing on the city walls to look outside, people would see blossoming white clouds. This city seemed to be built in the sky. While looking down, one would only see a vast expanse with no end.</p>
<p>Even while inside the city, people didn’t know where it was located. This has always been a hot topic with great discussions and studies. However, the answer remains a mystery.</p>
<p>There were stories of people jumping down from the wall in order to locate where Dragonhark actually was, but there would be no return after jumping down. From then on, no one from future generations dared to jump down the wall unless they were tired of living.</p>
<p>Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu jumped off their fish, and the fish swam away with their tails flapping about.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1240: Destroying The Dao Foundation</h4>
<p>Chapter 1240: Destroying The Dao Foundation</p>
<p>Li Qiye brought Zhang Baitu straight to the Rainbow Pavilion in Dragonhark. They reserved a small courtyard and settled down.</p>
<p>The Rainbow Pavilion was the biggest inn at Dragonhark. In fact, it was the only one in Dragonhark and all of Rainbow City as well.</p>
<p>No one knew why there was only one inn in the entire region. Some believed that the inn belonged to Rainbow City and that they didn’t wish to share this business with outsiders. Others stated that behind the inn stood the Jian Clan. This clan had a very deep relationship with Rainbow City.</p>
<p>Despite being the only inn here, the pricing was very reasonable and it could accommodate more than ten thousand guests. Because of this, there were no complaints from outsiders upon visiting the inn.</p>
<p>After taking care of Zhang Baitu, Li Qiye went out to buy some medicinal materials. When he passed by the lobby, he heard a shopkeeper advertising to the guests: “Fair to the young and old with the right price, we have eighty million years of reputation!”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper was an old man around the mortal age of seventy with a gray robe. His appearance was not too outstanding, but he was very hardworking, evident by the calluses on his hands.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smirked after seeing the shopkeeper and revealed a very interested smile.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper noticed Li Qiye and smiled back: “Sir, do you want to go out or need something?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled back: “How can you prove that your reputation has been great for more than eighty million years?”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper laughed and replied: “Ah, Sir, just look at my age and you should know that I am not a swindler. My hair is completely gray from the torments of time. At this age, why would I need to lie, right?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued to smile and leisurely responded: “Was it an eventful experience?”</p>
<p>“You are asking about my life?” The shopkeeper happily responded: “It wasn’t bad, so-so I guess. I don’t want much at this age, only a full belly. And of course, my old bones have a bunch of children and grandchildren as well. What more do I want? Just food and clothing and children playing around me, this is more than enough for an old man like me.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded while looking at him and movingly said: “You’re right, what more do you want in life? Warmth and food with children surrounding you — quite an enviable lifestyle.”</p>
<p>The talkative shopkeeper asked with a grin: “Sir, do you have any other pursuits in life?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye pondered for a bit before smiling at the shopkeeper: “I just want an answer, that’s all I need.”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper rubbed his clothing with his callused hands and continued: “Who can have all the answers in life?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye responded: “No one knows the answer, which is why I require it.” With that, he turned and left the inn.</p>
<p>“What is the goal of life?” Li Qiye sighed and recalled the past. In a distant era, someone had asked him the same question at Rainbow City.</p>
<p>It had been said that the heaven and earth were too unreachable. All were mere ants below them, but this was also fine. It was just like the old man said, there was nothing bad about being content with a life surrounded by loved ones.</p>
<p>Li Qiye walked on slowly in silence while contemplating this issue and the unforgettable words.</p>
<p>Being an ant within this unreachable heaven and earth was not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>He became lost in a daze. There was once an extremely wise man here who eventually chose a peaceful ending.</p>
<p>After a while, he lifted his head towards the distance. With an incomparably firm gaze, as if nothing and nobody could shake him, he said: “No matter how distant the heaven and earth might be and regardless of how long this path is before the end, I just need an answer. This has always been the case in the past, the present, and will be so in the future as well!”</p>
<p>He smiled freely after this and entered the streets full of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Rainbow City was too large to be measured. Even though there were very few landmasses in the Heaven Spirit World, there were still several big cities. The ones here weren’t necessarily the biggest ones in this world, but they were definitely among the top ten.</p>
<p>Dragonhark, as the first stopping point, was very lively. This was the biggest market in Rainbow City. It could even be considered the largest in all of Heaven Spirit.</p>
<p>There were sea demons from this region, charming spirits from the Abyss Sea, and treants from the Jade Sea.</p>
<p>In addition to the many shops, cultivators set up little stalls along the streets to sell their treasures and some were searching for alchemy ingredients. It was a scene that encompassed all sorts of images.</p>
<p>Many cultivators came here due to the great reputation and size of this market at Dragonhark. There was a phrase used to describe this place: there is nothing one couldn’t buy here for the right price.</p>
<p>Li Qiye bought a lot of materials for Zhang Baitu. They weren’t that precious, which was why he just went outside to buy them.</p>
<p>He was getting ready to destroy Baitu’s cultivation in order to have him start over from the beginning. Because his cultivation was needlessly complex and convoluted, it was only harmful without any benefits.</p>
<p>Of course, it would have been much easier for a young cultivator to destroy their cultivation, but it was different for Zhang Baitu. He was no longer young and his blood energy was quite feeble. Without being supplemented by pills, destroying his cultivation would only send him to see his maker.</p>
<p>After preparing all the alchemy ingredients, he readied the cauldron to refine them. The flame ignited and melted all the ingredients. It burned away the dregs and left behind the essences.</p>
<p>Eventually, the fire flowed like a pot of soup within. In this moment, it was difficult to tell the fire from the medicinal essences.</p>
<p>Under Li Qiye’s instruction, Zhang Baitu stepped into the cauldron. The fire seemed to have its own life and slowly infiltrated Zhang Baitu’s body with the essences. They protected his meridians and veins.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ordered: “Remember, focus your energy while clearing your mind of needless thoughts.”</p>
<p>Any carelessness would result in death for an old cultivator like Zhang Baitu, so Li Qiye had no choice but to use this method.</p>
<p>The old man followed his order and calmed his mind while converging his vitality. He could feel the essences flowing through his body.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, Li Qiye began and shattered Zhang Baitu’s dao foundation with lightning speed.</p>
<p>“Crack!” Zhang Baitu’s dao foundation collapsed in an instant. He trembled and almost audibly screamed, but he managed to endure the pain.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was fast and accurate as he quickly and completely destroyed the foundation. At this time, there was nothing left of the broken foundation in Zhang Baitu. All of the residue was destroyed without leaving behind any traces.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu now resembled a mortal that had never cultivated before. The essences began to integrate into the key locations in his body, every muscle and joint, in order to strengthen him.</p>
<p>His condition stabilized due to the medicine. Otherwise, someone else at his age experiencing this process would immediately turn into a hunchback old man after losing their dao foundation.</p>
<p>Li Qiye withdrew the fire and Zhang Baitu fell to the ground. There weren’t too many visible changes to him. His hair had become grayer and he had lost the aura of a cultivator. However, his complexion was quite ruddy like an immortal with gray hair, yet he still had the face of a young man. This was a very healthy and rare constitution for a mortal man.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu’s vision worsened and he was unable to walk as if he was flying like other cultivators. Most of his abilities were gone as well. Of course, this was the great difference between a mortal and a cultivator.</p>
<p>“Maybe it isn’t that bad being a mortal sometimes.” Zhang Baitu sighed emotionally after his regression.</p>
<p>The sense of loss was there, but it was not overwhelming. After all, his cultivation was extremely shallow in the first place. This would be a completely different scenario for a master. Some wouldn’t be able to handle losing their cultivation.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Young Noble.” Zhang Baitu quickly thanked Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively: “There’s no need to be emotional, what you have lost will return not long from now.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble, you wish to pass down a merit law to me?!” Zhang Baitu happily asked right away after hearing this.</p>
<p>Despite knowing his terrible talents and that he wouldn’t get much further in his life in terms of cultivation, he had never given up before. Persistence was part of his character.</p>
<p>His hope had been rekindled after becoming a mortal and listening to Li Qiye.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1241: Dragonhark Valley</h4>
<p>Chapter 1241: Dragonhark Valley</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head in response: “No, I don’t have the right merit law to pass down to you. A member of the Zhang must cultivate the Zhang Clan’s law.”</p>
<p>“But my clan’s laws have been lost for a long time now.” Zhang Baitu hesitated for a moment before speaking: “Even Dongting Lake might not have our laws. None of the ancestors said anything about it.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly replied: “Your Zhang Clan doesn’t have them and the lake might not either, but Dragonhark Valley will.”</p>
<p>“Dragonhark Valley?” Zhang Baitu was surprised: “Why would my clan’s laws be at the valley?” He didn’t understand the connection between the two entities.</p>
<p>“To be more exact, those laws exist in this place.” With that, Li Qiye pointed at his head and said: “If you are able to be enlightened at the valley, you will obtain your clan’s merit laws once more.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was dazed. Even though he was not good at cultivation, he was not a fool. With a slightly startled expression, he asked: “Young Noble, are you saying that my clan’s laws came from the valley itself?”</p>
<p>“You can put it that way.” Li Qiye nonchalantly spoke: “Your forefathers’ bloodline is not the purest of human bloodlines, so your members can only cultivate the clan’s laws. Through meditation and enlightenment at the valley, you will find what you desire.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu looked distracted. He knew far less than Li Qiye about his own ancestors, but he didn’t dare to ask why Li Qiye was aware of this.</p>
<p>“Can, can I do it?” He was lacking confidence after calming down.</p>
<p>He couldn’t be blamed for this since failure had haunted him for years. The failure of his first attempt at cultivation had already shattered his confidence completely, leaving him unsure of himself.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stared at him and replied: “A calm heart is more important than anything else. During your meditation, stay calm and everything will flow naturally. You are the descendant of the Zhang Clan; if you can’t do it, who can? Remember, your Zhang bloodline flows through you. This makes you different from everyone else.”</p>
<p>After being encouraged by Li Qiye, Zhang Baitu could feel his blood beginning to stir.</p>
<p>“In this world, talent is not the most crucial thing, an unfaltering dao heart is much more important. After so many years, countless geniuses have failed, it’s not just you. Even invincible Immortal Emperors have failed many times during their youth. No one can be unstoppable throughout their entire life. Only through failure will one understand their own lackings. Lessons and experiences can be gained from failure…” Li Qiye took his time encouraging and waking up Zhang Baitu.</p>
<p>The old man’s eyes lit up. In a short period of time, he could feel the blood of the Zhang Clan channeling even faster. He was full of hope at this moment.</p>
<p>Eventually, he kneeled on the ground and gratefully said: “I will engrave your wise words into my mind and never forget them.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ordered: “Very good. Let us go to Dragonhark Valley then.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu nodded. At this time, he was full of energy and felt that he was suddenly young again, just like the past when he began his arduous search for the first time.</p>
<p>Dragonhark Valley was located in the southern region of Dragonhark. The entire valley was huge with exquisite sceneries consisting of tall peaks, tranquil ravines, and many waterfalls…</p>
<p>There were many legends about this valley. One stated that the old giant dragon back then was enlightened in this valley and left behind an indelible mark.</p>
<p>Another stated that the demon dragon who went against the heavens and failed left its magical bones behind after dying. Some of these magical bones eventually turned into Dragonhark Valley.</p>
<p>No one knows if these two rumors were real or not. However, many people came to the valley in search for the grand dao from the legends, the legacy of a true dragon. Alas, despite their pursuit for the mysteries here, many left empty-handed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some claimed to have heard a dragon’s roar coming from the valley. After going back, they eventually comprehended more of the dao. A few of them became experts and claimed that they had heard whispers of a true dragon granting them great wisdom.</p>
<p>No one had heard of someone being able to obtain the legacy of this true dragon or the legendary magical bones. Nevertheless, there were indeed tangible benefits present at the valley.</p>
<p>The two came to the entrance of the valley that resembled the gaping jaws of a dragon. Just this scene alone showed that the valley's reputation was more than just empty rumors.</p>
<p>The moment they entered, they could see that there was already a line of cultivators waiting. Some were sticking around to watch as well.</p>
<p>“Get in line, hurry up.” An old man dressed in a light blue robe with a pointed hat was guarding this entrance.</p>
<p>“Ten Heavenly King Jades, an extremely fair price.” The old man collected money while yelling: “Come, come, do not miss the one and only Dragonhark Valley in this world. Inside are true dragon bones, immortal draconic runes… As long as you are lucky enough, you will be able to obtain these mythical artifacts…”</p>
<p>“... Think about it, just ten Heavenly King Jades to trade for dragon bones and runes… What a generous trade!” The old man’s voice was quite powerful: “With these artifacts, the next sea god could be you, the contemporary Immortal Emperor can’t be anyone else but you, becoming a treefather is possible as well. Ten Heavenly King Jades to win a chance at becoming a sea god, proving your regal ascendance or transforming into a treefather. This is the best transaction you could ever have.”</p>
<p>The old man kept on shouting like a street peddler while collecting all the jades.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” A young first-timer heard this and had to ask: “Are there really true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes in there?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, little fella, don’t listen to him.” An older cultivator laughed and explained: “He has always been shouting these words. Fifty years ago when I last came, he was saying the same thing.”</p>
<p>“You can’t put it like that.” The old man answered with a serious tone: “My reputation is as valuable as gold and is completely trustworthy. I guarantee in the name of my ancestors that there are indeed draconic bones and runes inside.”</p>
<p>“Stop! You told me the same thing fifty years ago and tricked me to come several times while giving you everything I had. In the end, did I leave with anything but empty hands?” The old cultivator retorted with disdain while feeling annoyed.</p>
<p>The old man didn’t become angry with his answer: “I can’t be blamed for this. It only shows that you did not research enough. Otherwise, after several entries, you should have been able to get lucky, find the artifacts, and embark on the heaven-defying path to becoming a sea god and marrying a goddess, that’s for sure. Come, come, come now. Ten Heavenly King Jades, this is an amazing deal.”</p>
<p>The old cultivator snorted and wasn’t tempted by the old man.</p>
<p>A skeptical cultivator remarked: “If there are truly draconic bones and runes inside, then how come you aren’t keeping them for your own use?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head and said: “Fellow daoist, your perspective is too mundane. People say that the heavenly treasures of this world are meant for the destined. What kind of items are true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes? They are supreme immortal artifacts, so how can a lowly man like me obtain them? Because of this, I am leaving this opportunity to the fated ones.”</p>
<p>The skeptic had no response and kept quiet after hearing this.</p>
<p>“Plus, many experts benefitted from coming to Dragonhark Valley. When an overlord heard the sound of the rain in this place, he immediately became enlightened and soared to the heavens overnight. There was also a sea god who listened to the wind. In just one day, he created an invincible art, and from then on, he alone was unbeatable in this world…” The old man became quite excited as he blabbered on and on.</p>
<p>A cultivator quietly muttered under his breath: “How outrageous...”</p>
<p>Of course, the overlord and sea god mentioned by the old man were all exaggerations. However, it was undeniable that there had been masters in the valley who obtained great harvests by just listening to the sounds in the valley itself.</p>
<p>After his long boast, he told the skeptic from earlier: “Okay, do you want in or not? If not, then go to the side. People are all lining up behind you.”</p>
<p>This skeptic hesitated for a moment but still decided to pay to enter the valley.</p>
<p>In the line, Li Qiye cheerfully smiled at this old man. He enjoyed listening to him a lot.</p>
<p>When it was Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu’s turn, Baitu only looked at Li Qiye since he couldn’t take out so many refined jades.</p>
<p>“Two people so twenty Heavenly King Jades.” The old man smiled at them.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked at them, neither Li Qiye or Zhang Baitu looked like people with money, so a human cultivator kindly reminded them: “Little brother, refined jades don’t come easily, you are better off using them wisely.”</p>
<p>“Little brat! It’s fine if you don’t want to come in, but you want to ruin my business as well? Do you want me to throw you into the Bonesea right now?!” The old man violently changed his tune right away after seeing this human wanting to interfere with his business.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1242: Zhang Baitus Dao Enlightenment</h4>
<p>Chapter 1242: Zhang Baitu’s Dao Enlightenment</p>
<p>The human cultivator fled right away after being scolded by the old man. Throughout history, no one dared to offend Rainbow City. Rumor has it that even a contemporary sea god wouldn’t test them.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and handed the refined jades over.</p>
<p>The old man immediately beamed happily after getting the refined jades and said: “I wish you two luck in comprehending the supreme grand dao to reach the peak of this world.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye grinned and looked at the old man and leisurely spoke: “You said earlier that there are draconic bones and runes in the valley. If I carelessly dig them up, do they all belong to me then?”</p>
<p>“Well.” The old man’s expression changed after hearing this but he still revealed a smile in the end: “Well, yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye saw his expression and started to laugh before patting his shoulder and said: “I’m just joking. I’ll only take him to listen to the sounds here for dao enlightenment.” With that, he brought Zhang Baitu into the valley.</p>
<p>The old man’s smile froze as his body became stiff. He watched Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu disappear into the valley.</p>
<p>“I have to go too.” Eventually, someone from the line spoke up, waking the old man up from his stupor. Just thinking about Li Qiye’s grin left the old man frightened with chills running down his spine.</p>
<p>“Rascal, don’t play with me.” Eventually, the old man murmured in a low voice that only he could hear.</p>
<p>This was Zhang Baitu’s first time coming to Dragonhark. Even though he knew about it beforehand, he didn’t have enough money for the entry fee.</p>
<p>He curiously asked: “Does this place really have those mythical items?” In his eyes, Li Qiye was an expert at everything.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t think about these things.” Li Qiye beamingly smiled in response: “Finding them is nice, but it’s fine to be without them as well. They are not meant for you.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu quietly nodded. He naturally didn’t have unrealistic expectations. In his eyes, being able to comprehend the Zhang merit laws was more than enough. As for the bones and runes, they were supreme items that he didn’t dare to think about.</p>
<p>There were beautiful sceneries everywhere in this big valley with majestic cliffs, elegant springs, and a pleasant melody from the rustling leaves.</p>
<p>They saw cultivators in many places. Some were sitting on top of cliffs while huffing and puffing the energy of the clouds. Others were meditating below waterfalls to quietly listen to the sound of the water. There were also those sitting in the pine forest in order to comprehend the grand dao.</p>
<p>Even though ten Heavenly King Jades were a lot to many, experts from great powers were willing to try at least once. Who in this world didn’t want to become enlightened in the dao?</p>
<p>Moreover, for those who had reached a bottleneck, they needed an opportunity to break through.</p>
<p>There were rumors that there were dragon roars or even the whispering of a true dragon in this valley. How could there be smoke without fire? Some experts had made these claims before while meditating in this place.</p>
<p>Because of this, many cultivators came here in hopes of getting lucky. Perhaps they would be able to experience the same type of adventures as well.</p>
<p>The duo crossed over the mountains and went deeper inside towards their destination.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, have you been here before?” Zhang Baitu asked after seeing how familiar Li Qiye was with this place. Li Qiye only responded with a mysterious grin.</p>
<p>Many of the cultivators they met didn’t find anything, so they kept on changing their location.</p>
<p>“Eh, isn’t that Hundred-Disciple?” A few cultivators recognized Zhang Baitu along the way. The majority of them were from the sects near Dongting Lake. [1. Baitu = Hundred-Disciple.]</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu had joined many sects without any results. Because of this, the cultivators near Dongting Lake all knew about him.</p>
<p>“Zhang Baitu, are you here to listen to the valley as well?” A cultivator shook his head and laughed: “In my opinion, you should be saving money to buy a coffin, that will save a lot of trouble. You have joined so many sects for no reason, do you think you will actually gain anything here at Dragonhark Valley?”</p>
<p>Another cultivator saw Li Qiye standing next to him and mocked: “Who would have thought that you, Zhang Baitu, would actually try to be exemplary one day and take in a disciple. Hey, child, finding a master is a lifelong event, so you can’t be careless or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life after finding the wrong master.”</p>
<p>The majority of the people who recognized Zhang Baitu started with taunts or mocked Li Qiye. Of course, there were some who had good intentions and advised Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn’t respond to any of them and only followed right behind Li Qiye. He had grown used to these remarks and had heard much worse before.</p>
<p>After a while, in a more remote location, he whispered: “It is my fault for tarnishing your reputation, Young Noble.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively and insipidly commented: “There’s no need to take to heart the words of mere ants.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn't say anything else and continued to follow him.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two went into a thicket with fresh verdant leaves. When the breeze blew by, one could hear their fluttering rattle like a melody.</p>
<p>Li Qiye walked around before stopping in front of a dying tree. He carefully looked at this old tree and nodded: “Right here.”</p>
<p>He then ordered Zhang Baitu: “Sit with your back against this tree and calm your mind. Block off your six senses to feel its rhythm. Remember, stay calm — this is the only way you will feel its existence.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu solemnly shook his head and took a deep breath. He sat down firmly under this old tree with his back against it. He closed his eyes and shut off his six senses then began to feel it.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked over him for a bit before quietly leaving. At the same time, he casually drew a circle around this thicket.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu meditated in order to sense this old tree. However, moments passed by and there were no signs of change. In the beginning, he was able to keep calm, but he gradually lost his patience and his breathing turned rapid.</p>
<p>“Remember, it exists when your heart is calm. You are the descendant of the Zhang Clan, this is something you should have. Be patient and persevere.” Li Qiye was watching everything from a distance.</p>
<p>His words were like a tranquilizing pill. The anxious Zhang Baitu slowly calmed down again with steady breaths. His quiet meditation began once more.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Zhang Baitu? Is he actually thinking about comprehending the dao?” Someone laughed while looking at Zhang Baitu meditating under the tree.</p>
<p>Another said with disdain: “He wants to understand the dao? Such wishful thinking.”</p>
<p>Their companion sarcastically commented: “People say that one can only succeed after experiencing failures and learning from the lessons. Zhang Baitu had so many masters after joining numerous sects for nothing at all, so maybe he has accumulated enough experience. Come, let us see if he can comprehend anything.”</p>
<p>Although some cultivators were dismissive of him, others were irritated by their own lack of progress, so they wanted to tease him to get rid of their bad mood. In their eyes, Zhang Baitu was only a piece of trash. They could humiliate him however they want.</p>
<p>“Don’t cross the line.” Li Qiye coldly spoke the moment these ill-willed cultivators approached his line.</p>
<p>These cultivators stopped and one of them laughed: “Oh? You must be Zhang Baitu’s disciple. Hah, a foolish master can only produce an idiotic disciple. You think you can comprehend the dao here as well?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored him and emotionlessly repeated: “Don’t cross the line or face the consequences.”</p>
<p>“Brat, who do you think you are?!” Li Qiye’s attitude made a few younger cultivators with some status quite annoyed. They contemptuously spoke: “You think we’ll listen to you? What are you going to do about it? Only an ant yet you still dare to shout in front of us! So what if we cross the line, are you gonna bite me? Oh wait, I forgot, a dog that bites will never bark.”</p>
<p>With that, they headed towards Zhang Baitu.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye. Instead, he performed a sweeping kick. These cultivators turned furious after seeing this, and one of the nobles said: “Naive fool!”</p>
<p>“Bang!” They couldn’t even counter since they were kicked flying by Li Qiye. Blood spurted out along with many explosions; Li Qiye mercilessly sent them into many huge trees with blood spraying everywhere.</p>
<p>He then stared at them coldly and slowly walked over.</p>
<p>At this time, these pale cultivators were frightened. They wanted to crawl back up, especially the noble-looking one. He screamed: “You, don’t come over here, don’t come over here!”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1243: Dragon Sound</h4>
<p>Chapter 1243: Dragon Sound</p>
<p>“Ah—” In a short period of time, screams resounded left and right in these woods along with a series of bone-breaking noises.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Qiye was stomping on the legs of these cultivators. Their legs were crushed completely as they howled like slaughtered pigs. These shrill screams echoed across the thicket.</p>
<p>“Who is so ruthless?” The screams alarmed some of the nearby cultivators. They came with curiosity and saw Li Qiye’s leg-breaking fest. Their eyes darted at each other and wondered just who this human kid was and why he dared to be so vicious.</p>
<p>Eventually, with a loud bang, Li Qiye stomped on the noble-looking youth and coldly glared at him.</p>
<p>The paled cultivator busily shouted: “Don’t, don’t do anything stupid. I, I am a disciple of the Wyvern Country, a great power in the Dragon Demon Sea. If, if you dare to kill me, my country will not treat it lightly.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” His wrist was stomped by Li Qiye.</p>
<p>This Wyvern disciple and everyone else shut up. They knew that they had messed with the wrong guy. This fella was too ruthless.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only wanted to teach them a lesson. If he wanted to kill them, it would have been easier than crushing an ant.</p>
<p>“Boom!” Li Qiye kicked this disciple from Wyvern flying through many trees while shouting: “Scram, don’t let me see you again!”</p>
<p>These cultivators pissed their pants from fear. After hearing this, it was like they had been pardoned; they quickly rolled on the ground to get up and run away.</p>
<p>The disciple from Wyvern was from a great power and so couldn't swallow his anger. After he flew far enough, he exclaimed: “Brat, leave, leave your name if you dare!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave him a side-eye and replied: “Li Qiye.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, the disciple faltered several steps backward in horror. He had just heard this name recently.</p>
<p>Many cultivators who were watching for fun were startled as well, especially those who heard the news from the Jade Sea, they became completely pale. One of them said: “He is the disciple of the Peacock Tree, the successor of that land. He, he helped the tree sacrifice a billion Teeming Fish, no wonder why he is so ruthless!”</p>
<p>News of the tree’s blood refinement had reached the Dragon Demon Sea. Of course, many believed that this was the masterpiece of the Peacock Tree while Li Qiye only acted as the tree controller. He became famous overnight due to the prestige that came with being an ancestral tree’s disciple.</p>
<p>A cultivator commented in horror: “Damn! He helped the Peacock Tree annihilate an entire race. This ancestral tree is definitely a monster, so being its disciple, he can’t be a kind person either; he’s definitely a little monster as well.”</p>
<p>The massacre of the Teeming Race, the most populous tribe in Heaven Spirit, had shocked countless people. This added to Li Qiye’s notoriety despite everyone assuming that he was only the treefather’s accomplice.</p>
<p>Just imagine, billions of lives were refined overnight. Anyone would quiver with weak knees after hearing this. As for the Wyvern disciple and his companions, needless to say, they turned and fled as far as they could. They didn’t dare to think about taking revenge any longer. Li Qiye’s fierce reputation had shattered their courage.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, the cultivators outside the thicket had ugly expressions. Many even chose to run away to avoid provoking this fierce person.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored them and leaned on a tree as he watched Zhang Baitu.</p>
<p>A long time had passed, yet there was still no changes with Zhang Baitu. Nevertheless, Li Qiye was confident in him because the Zhang had some ties with this place as well as Rainbow City. It was just that their descendants didn’t know about these secrets.</p>
<p>Minutes came and went, but Zhang Baitu remained motionless as if he didn’t gain anything.</p>
<p>Prior to this, very few would watch him meditate. After all, those who had heard of his name knew that his talents were completely insufficient since he was still a failure after joining so many sects. They thought that this was simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>However, after being aware of Li Qiye’s great name, some became curious. Even though they didn’t know why this fierce man was hanging around Zhang Baitu, they wanted to see if the old man could harvest anything.</p>
<p>One thing was for certain as the clock ticked down, Zhang Baitu had reached a state of total calmness.</p>
<p>A while later, a crisp voice resounded next to Li Qiye: “Will Brother Zhang be able to do it?”</p>
<p>No one knows when Hong Yujiao appeared beside Li Qiye. She was quite worried while watching Zhang Baitu under the tree.</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly said: “All of you know nothing about what kind of people your ancestors were and what they experienced. This is because you have no interest in them at all.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao couldn’t refute because she was indeed ignorant of them.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao eventually spoke: “You are the successor of Peacock Land, a tree controller.” After returning, she uncovered all of his information and understood his identity.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t answer and continued his watch.</p>
<p>“I misunderstood you before.” She spoke after a moment of silence: “The Peacock Treefather has always been protecting the human race and is adored by many. You are its disciple, so I’m sure you weren’t scheming against Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled after hearing this. It seemed that the misconception of him being related to the Peacock Tree had spread uncontrollably. However, he was too lazy to correct them.</p>
<p>“My father wants to meet you.” She eventually revealed her goal.</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and replied: “What does he want to talk about? The Hundred-Saints Hall or what happened with the Ironscale School?”</p>
<p>“Most likely the business of the human race.” She replied: “Peacock Land is the second largest haven for humans after the Exquisite Valley. Even though Dongting Lake isn’t as large as Peacock Land, there are many things that can be done to mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, if he wants to talk, tell him to come and see me.” Li Qiye just smiled with a completely indifferent attitude.</p>
<p>She refrained from speaking. Li Qiye’s words sounded like a command for her father, so she couldn’t exactly tell him this.</p>
<p>“It’s time.” Li Qiye had been fixated on Zhang Baitu the whole time. His eyes flashed as he noticed something.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao quickly turned to look at her senior brother as well. A buzzing emanated from Zhang Baitu’s body as it lit up, emitting a frightening light.</p>
<p>The old tree behind him unexpectedly shook a little bit along with his body; it was as if they were touching something. The brilliance from his body increased as time went on, and the light slowly turned into rays.</p>
<p>The tree then stopped moving and a very faint sound came about. While listening to it carefully, one could vaguely hear the roar of a true dragon. The roar sounded as if it was saying something, but humans couldn’t understand it.</p>
<p>“Is that really the sound of a dragon?” The cultivators outside the thicket were astonished.</p>
<p>“What? How is this possible? Zhang Baitu actually obtained a fortune?” Some of them couldn’t believe this scene while murmuring to themselves.</p>
<p>They felt that this was simply impossible. Even though people said that dragon cries were present in the valley, only a very small number of masters were able to hear them. Others didn’t have this privilege.</p>
<p>Thus, it was even more impossible for Zhang Baitu who was known to have rubbish talent. Continuously failing despite joining so many sects left others thinking of him as a being that was hopelessly stupid.</p>
<p>It would be daydreaming for someone like him to think about gaining enlightenment in Dragonhark Valley.</p>
<p>However, a strange visual phenomenon was occurring around him. The impossible was unraveling before the crowd.</p>
<p>“That’s a dragon’s cry?” Hong Yujiao became absent-minded as well. She didn’t have much hope in Zhang Baitu either. It was not because she looked down on him, but because he indeed possessed some flaws in terms of cultivation.</p>
<p>“I think so.” The cultivators outside were jolted. They quickly sat down and focused in order to listen. They wanted to understand what the dragon was saying to obtain this fortune.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao attentively listened as well in order to comprehend the faint cries of the dragon.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1244: Dao Breakthrough</h4>
<p>Chapter 1244: Dao Breakthrough</p>
<p>With the passage of time, Zhang Baitu’s body became increasingly luminous while the dragon sounds from the old tree became more sonorous. In the end, it was no longer a vague sound, it truly became the voice of a dragon.</p>
<p>“It really is a dragon’s cry! The valley truly has them!” The voice of the dragon had alarmed many people. More and more came and were jolted by this sound.</p>
<p>Despite the rumors of its existence, few people had heard it before. Many had failed and given up in the past, but now, they were both ecstatic and somewhat afraid after hearing it.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, many cultivators began meditating right outside of this thicket and carefully listened to the profundities encompassed within these draconic sounds. By successfully doing so, perhaps they could understand the great mysteries of the supreme grand dao. From that, it might lead them to the path where the true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes awaited.</p>
<p>However, despite their best efforts, they couldn’t understand it. Even Hong Yujiao was no exception.</p>
<p>As time passed, the light from Zhang Baitu’s body gradually dimmed and the dragon’s voice from the old tree became fainter until it disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Many listeners returned to the present after it disappeared. They received nothing out of it since they couldn’t understand what it was saying or the mysteries within.</p>
<p>They, instead, stared at Zhang Baitu in disbelief, especially those who knew about him beforehand. This was an incredibly cruel joke.</p>
<p>He stood up before the crowd with a delighted expression. Without a doubt, he had quite a harvest. He walked to the front of Li Qiye and immediately prostrated to express his gratitude: “Thank you for guiding me from my past mistakes, this lowly one will never forget your kindness for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded his head and accepted the grand gesture.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Senior Brother. With today’s enlightenment, your future potential is limitless.” Hong Yujiao was happy for Zhang Baitu. By finally being able to take this step, he would surely have many amazing accomplishments later on.</p>
<p>“Sister, you are too kind. I only learned a little bit and can’t be shameless enough to accept the praise of having limitless potential.” Zhang Baitu was very modest in his response.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was still very excited because, in his eyes, only geniuses would be able to explore the grand dao. Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t reach this level, let alone a stupid person like himself.</p>
<p>He couldn’t even train regular merit laws, so he didn’t dare to think about the impossibility that was exploring the grand dao. However, he felt as if his mind had been cleared. With his newfound wisdom, a grand dao was appearing right before him.</p>
<p>People stared at him in disbelief due to his past reputation of being an incurable fool. It was simply inconceivable that such a guy could have become enlightened from listening to the voice of a dragon.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Li Qiye told Zhang Baitu and turned to walk away.</p>
<p>The brother and sister quickly followed him out of the thicket.</p>
<p>Of course, this valley didn’t only have dragon cries. It also contained other supreme immortal items, but Li Qiye naturally wouldn’t search for them.</p>
<p>After they left, a bunch of cultivators immediately jumped into the thicket and competed for the spot below the old tree.</p>
<p>The first cultivator that got to the tree said: “I was here first, let me try to meditate.”</p>
<p>“Why do you get to go first? Everyone here has paid, so if you want to meditate, the rest of us should be able to as well.” Another immediately voiced his displeasure.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the scene became chaotic. Everyone wanted to sit under this old tree to meditate. They felt that if a fool like Zhang Baitu could hear a dragon’s voice under the tree, then the rest of them would be able to gain much more than him.</p>
<p>The news of Zhang Baitu’s enlightenment spread across the valley. Many people had thought that it was not worth spending money to enter the valley, but they were now tempted and immediately handed their jades over to jump inside. They didn’t want to be one step slower than the others.</p>
<p>When Li Qiye got outside of the valley, he looked at the old man and leisurely smiled: “I heard that there is a treasure trove at Dragonwell, is that true?”</p>
<p>The old man’s expression changed after hearing this. Li Qiye laughed in response: “Don’t worry, I’m just messing with you. As for the treasure trove and dragon bones, they should be left for the destined ones.” With that, he turned and left.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you an eighty percent discount next time.” The old man cheerfully smiled at Li Qiye who was walking away.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t turn around to answer.</p>
<p>After they walked for a while, Hong Yujiao curiously asked: “Does Dragonhark really have dragon bones and runes?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued on while lightly answering: “Their existence isn’t important since they are not destined to be yours. However, if you must know, just keep in mind that your Dongting Lake and Rainbow City have deep ties. The same goes for the Giant Dragon Kingdom. I hope that as the lake’s descendants, you two won’t forget about your ancestors and roots. One day, you might need to rely on Rainbow City.”</p>
<p>“We have deep ties with Rainbow City and the Giant Dragon Kingdom?” Hong Yujiao was surprised.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu felt the same way. He had never heard about this before and spoke with disbelief: “I heard that the Giant Dragon Kingdom doesn’t actually exist since it is only part of the legends. No one has been there before.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye stopped and turned to look at the two: “It looks like you descendants are becoming worse and worse since you don’t even know your own roots. Just keep my words in mind. Aim higher than other people while maintaining your ambition and courage. Your clans chose to fight each other for power, but in the eyes of others, this is only a competition between ants. No one will care about the past glory of your ancestors.”</p>
<p>The duo exchanged glances. They didn’t completely understand what Li Qiye was referring to.</p>
<p>“Rely on each other during times of turmoil while maintaining great magnanimity towards all as well as your ancestors’ great moral values. One day, you two will understand your roots and at that time, those existences up in the clouds will finally take note of you. That will be the day when you find out just how glorious your clans used to be!”</p>
<p>He gently sighed and left one final remark while looking at them: “This is all I can do. The future relies on juniors like the two of you to build.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t want to bother with Dongting Lake’s power struggle back then, but right now, out of consideration for the ancestors from the Hong, Zhang and Xu Clans, Li Qiye couldn’t help but ultimately guide them. Whether they would be able to figure it out and take the next step would be up to themselves.</p>
<p>They must be the ones to grasp their own destinies. Others could only show them the way.</p>
<p>The duo carefully contemplated Li Qiye’s words. Even though they didn’t understand them completely, they certainly memorized them.</p>
<p>They didn’t go too far after leaving the valley when a young man came before them. He had an extraordinary presence and a bright glow. There was a pair of translucent jade-like horns that made him look quite fierce.</p>
<p>He grew happy the moment he saw Hong Yujiao and quickly walked forward to enthusiastically greet them: “Young Sister, we meet again.” [1. The sister for this one is for family friends.]</p>
<p>“Young Noble Shangguan, long time no see.” Hong Yujiao nodded her head in a polite manner that wasn’t overly welcoming yet not too distant at the same time.</p>
<p>The youth enthusiastically asked Hong Yujiao: “I heard that you wanted to go to Rainbow City. That’s great, how about we go together to Dragonhark Valley?”</p>
<p>She gently shook her head in response: “Thank you, but I was summoned by my seniors and must return to the sect.”</p>
<p>The youth became disappointed after hearing this. His eyes then darted over towards Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, he didn’t care for Li Qiye, but after seeing Li Qiye’s face, his eyes narrowed and he coldly stared at him: “You are Li Qiye, the successor of Peacock Land?”</p>
<p>“So what?” Li Qiye glanced at him in response.</p>
<p>The youth coldly said: “It’s very good that you have admitted it. You are the one who harmed disciples from my Wyvern Country.”</p>
<p>So it turned out that this youth was the Wyvern Crown Prince, Shangguan Feilong. He had recently heard of Li Qiye since his fellow disciples were beaten by him. He wanted to settle the score with Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye indifferently replied: “Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Remember that this isn’t your Peacock Land. This is the Dragon Demon Sea, not a place for you to act presumptuously.” Shangguan Feilong coldly said: “You need to give our country a proper answer for hurting our disciples.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble Shangguan, your disciples were at fault.” Hong Yujiao slowly spoke: “They provoked Young Noble Li which resulted in them being injured. They can only blame themselves for their lack of skill.”</p>
<p>At this time, Hong Yujiao stood up for Li Qiye.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1245: Dragonwell City</h4>
<p>Chapter 1245: Dragonwell City</p>
<p>After hearing Hong Yujiao, Shangguan Feilong darted his eyes at Li Qiye. Despite being unwilling, he still scowled and said: “Our disciples were incapable, and out of consideration for Young Sister Hong, I won’t pursue this any further. But Li, you better control yourself, this is the territory of us sea demons!”</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was a direct threat towards Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t really care. He had no intention of taking action against cultivators of Feilong’s level unless they were asking to die.</p>
<p>Feilong glared at Li Qiye one last time before cupping his fists at Hong Yujiao: “Young Sis, I have met my big sister, she says that she also wants to see Uncle. Wait for us after the birthday celebration of the Jian Ancestor, we will visit your house and see Uncle then.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao chose to be quiet instead of answering.</p>
<p>After Feilong left, Zhang Baitu worriedly looked at her and said: “Junior Sister, it looks like his big sister is coming to ask for an engagement. He must be feeling quite confident this time.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Hong Yujiao answered: “I won’t marry so easily.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be that simple.” Despite not staying at Dongting Lake, Zhang Baitu still knew a few things, resulting in his worries: “I heard that the Wyvern Country has always wanted a human with a great bloodline to help pass on their own. People say that Feilong’s bloodline is very powerful, the best of the younger generation with the exception of his sister.”</p>
<p>“I also heard that they wanted to become in-laws with the Exquisite Valley. Unfortunately for them, the valley refused right away.” Zhang Baitu continued: “Sister, your bloodline is the most exceptional in our lake, so the Wyvern Country won’t give up that easily. Plus, with his sister coming in person, they will also have the backing of the Roaring Conch, giving them ample leverage.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, so what if Shangguan Feiyan is back?” Hong Yujiao snorted: “Can they really force this marriage?!”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu could only sigh. There was no point in worrying about it since he wasn’t strong enough to do anything.</p>
<p>Regardless of her tough posturing, she still reminded Li Qiye: “Young Noble Li, there’s no need to worry about this Shangguan Feilong. However, his sister, Shuangguan Feiyan, warrants some caution. She comes from the Roaring Conch and is doted on by its ancestors. People say that there is a possibility of her marrying the Seashield Prince to become the mistress of the Roaring Conch…”</p>
<p>“... Sometimes, taking a step back is the right way to go about things. You don’t need to go head-on against the Wyvern Country.” She warned him with good intent: “After all, the Roaring Conch is very powerful at the Dragon Demon Sea. They can even order the sea demons around the world.”</p>
<p>So it turns out that Shangguan Feilong came from Wyvern, a great power in this sea region. Of course, the thing they were most proud about was not the true dragon bloodline coursing through their veins, it was Shangguan Feiyan who was able to join the Roaring Conch and become one of the youngest God-Monarchs.</p>
<p>Li Qiye responded to these warnings with a smile. Hong Yujiao sighed because she understood that her words went in one ear and out the other.</p>
<p>After leaving the valley, she also wanted to return to Dongting Lake in order to report to her father. Before leaving, she respectfully said her goodbyes: “I’ll go report to my father about this. Hopefully, you will meet him at least once.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye insipidly responded: “Tell him to come meet me at Dragonwell.”</p>
<p>After she left, Li Qiye told Zhang Baitu: “Go back and clean up your belongings, we’ll be going to Dragonwell.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu nodded. At this time, he would obey any command from Li Qiye.</p>
<p>After packing his stuff, he followed Li Qiye to Dragonwell. This was the second stop of Rainbow City. There was only one way to go from Dragonhark to Dragonwell, and that was to ride the rainbow fish.</p>
<p>Just like Dragonhark, no one knew where Dragonwell was located, they only knew that these fish were the only method of transportation linking all the cities together. At the very least, no one had heard of someone being able to go from one city to another using a different method.</p>
<p>The duo arrived at the ferry again and found that there was already a long line. It was still an ordinary old man collecting money at the entrance.</p>
<p>He had a light blue robe with an indifferent expression. He stared at the cultivators as if all of them owed him money.</p>
<p>When it was Li Qiye’s turn, Li Qiye said: “To Dragonwell.”</p>
<p>The old man glanced at the two and pointed at Zhang Baitu: “You, one Provisional Palace Jade.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was surprised and stammered: “It, it has always been free for me at Rainbow City. Rainbow Island to Dragonhark was free for me just earlier.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn’t really know why it had always been free for him. Maybe that particular old man knew that he didn’t have enough money to pay. Nevertheless, always paying no fee left him a bit embarrassed since he wasn’t the type who relished taking advantage of others.</p>
<p>“One Provisional Palace Jade.” The old man ignored him then reached out his hand towards Li Qiye and coldly demanded: “You, one thousand Virtuous Paragon Jades.”</p>
<p>“That’s outrageous!” Zhang Baitu was scared silly: “It didn’t cost us that much to come here from Rainbow Island.”</p>
<p>“Pay if you want to go. If not, then scram already!” The old man angrily shouted, leaving no room for negotiation.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu glanced at Li Qiye. This old man clearly wanted to play them, especially Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled with a carefree attitude as he handed a black pouch over to the old man.</p>
<p>The old man put the pouch away without looking at the contents before whistling for two rainbow fish.</p>
<p>“How much will you charge me to go to the city in the clouds?” Li Qiye smiled at the old man.</p>
<p>The old man didn’t bat an eye as he replied with the same emotionless expression: “Who knows.”</p>
<p>“Money is not a problem.” Li Qiye leisurely pressed on: “I will have to go up there eventually, so take out your abacus to calculate how much it will cost.”</p>
<p>The cold old man didn’t want to answer, so he didn’t make a single sound.</p>
<p>After sitting on the fish, Li Qiye added in a serious tone: “Since I have to visit it either way, I hope the rainbow fish will take me there at that time, okay?”</p>
<p>The old man remained quiet. At this time, the fish were spewing bubbles. They floated along the bubbles and disappeared right away.</p>
<p>When Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu regained their vision, they were in a different city. This was the second stop of Rainbow City — Dragonwell.</p>
<p>According to the legends, Dragonwell hid unparalleled treasures that remained veiled from the public eye.</p>
<p>After they disembarked the fish, Zhang Baitu curiously asked: “Young Noble, what kind of city is above the clouds?”</p>
<p>He knew that Rainbow City consisted of Dragonhark, Dragonwell, and Dragonspring, but he had never heard of a city above the clouds, people never mentioned it.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know, so don’t ask.” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “If, one day, the people up there notice you, then you will naturally learn about them. Just keep trying, the future is still full of opportunities.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu didn’t ask again. He breathed deeply and nodded.</p>
<p>“Stay at the Rainbow Pavilion branch.” Li Qiye casually handed some jades to Zhang Baitu before leaving.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu watched him leave without asking where he wanted to go and headed for the inn right afterward.</p>
<p>Li Qiye walked along the long street with his heart slightly jumping. Something seemed to be affecting him as unwanted memories resurfaced in his mind.</p>
<p>He took his time walking to the end of the street. An old mansion appeared before him. Its age didn’t affect its majestic aura, as if there was an overlord presiding over the estate.</p>
<p>A wooden plaque with the word “Jian” could be found hanging at the entrance. It was written in an archaic style that contained infinite prestige.</p>
<p>The Jian Clan of Rainbow City was a legendary existence. Despite its low profile, people still viewed it with awe and respect.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that the Jian Clan were the only outsiders who were allowed to stay long-term at Rainbow City. This was the only stopping place for humans in the entire city.</p>
<p>Rainbow City was vast. Many powerful lineages, such as the Seven Martial Pavilion and the Roaring Conch, wanted to establish their own strongholds or divisions in this place.</p>
<p>However, regardless of how strong they were, even when their sea gods were still alive, they couldn’t get into Rainbow City. These powerful lineages didn’t dare to act recklessly here without permission from the city.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1246: Jian Clan</h4>
<p>Chapter 1246: Jian Clan</p>
<p>The Jian Clan had established their lineage in Rainbow City a very long time ago. They had a pivotal position in this place, similar to their position in the Dragon Demon Sea and all of Heaven Spirit.</p>
<p>They were even more significant for the human race. As the only human lineage capable of staying in Rainbow City, the clan had done many favors for the human race.</p>
<p>Even though the disciples from this clan rarely showed themselves outside of the city, they had always been very reasonable. No one has ever looked down on the Jian Clan, whether they be the charming spirit’s four branches or the treant’s Golden Isle as well as the sea demon’s Roaring Conch and Seven Martial Pavilion. Whenever their ancestors visited Dragonwell, they would go visit the Jian Clan as well.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, whenever the Jian Clan got involved, the parties would always show them some consideration.</p>
<p>The origin of the Jian Clan remained unknown. Outsiders didn’t know what kind of lineage they were. The only thing known was that they were humans that were closely related to Rainbow City. This was not only a low-key clan but also one shrouded in mysteries.</p>
<p>Many of the great powers, especially the behemoths, had traceable backgrounds. Their ancestors were either sea gods, treefathers, or Immortal Emperors. The weakest among their ancestors would be unstoppable Godkings, and tales of their ancestors would be sung in the contemporary.</p>
<p>This was not the case for the Jian ancestors. The clan was just as mysterious as the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. It seemed that the clan suddenly appeared overnight. What was even stranger was that they established a stronghold in Rainbow City very quickly.</p>
<p>While standing on the street and looking into the Jian Clan that was just inches away, Li Qiye felt an indescribable emotion. For him, the Jian Clan was also a home. Many of his footprints and memories were left in this place. However, he didn’t want to go inside right now.</p>
<p>“The heavens is too unreachable, there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” A lass once whispered this to him.</p>
<p>Whenever he stood before these gates, these words would echo in his mind. There was nothing in this world that could hinder his path or make him stop. Alas, this sentence haunted his mind and made him feel quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Resting was impossible for him, at least not in this lifetime. For many, starting a family and having children was not difficult, but this was a life unattainable for Li Qiye.</p>
<p>He sighed in disappointment and murmured: “I can’t do that. I will never be an ant that submits to the world. I am the bloodstained hand that will slay to the very end, death is my companion and blood makes up my bed!”</p>
<p>Through the ages, some wished that he would continue on while others hoped that he could rest. Alas, these people eventually left the world. No one could persevere with him on this endless fight.</p>
<p>There was a little shop along the path. It sold snacks and lighter dishes with only a few tables. It wasn’t early in the day anymore, but the old stove in the shop still let off curling steam and smoke.</p>
<p>His heart slightly jolted after seeing the shop. He didn’t enter the Jian Clan and instead quietly sat down at a table.</p>
<p>There was only one gray-haired old man working as both the waiter and the cook. His apron looked dated; it had been exposed to smoke for an incredible amount of time, yet it was still clean.</p>
<p>The old man quickly came and asked after Li Qiye sat down: “Sir, what would you like?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye blurted out without thinking: “One bowl of boiled tofu.” This was an all too familiar answer. He gently sighed again when his mind returned.</p>
<p>“Okay, coming right up.” The old man was very agile and immediately cooked some for him.</p>
<p>“Boiled tofu...” Li Qiye smiled wryly. Back then, he had tasted this dish countless times at this very shop. This was a style that originated from the Mortal Emperor World and was next to impossible to forget.</p>
<p>At that time, there were two little girls who also enjoyed eating here. In the faint steam, these two were always at odds. Who would have thought that one of them would eventually become an invincible empress?</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before the old man presented the bowl before Li Qiye. Its warmth thawed his cold heart. He began eating each piece of slippery and tender tofu as the familiar taste melted in his mouth.</p>
<p>“This boiled tofu is a delicacy in this world. No one will ever get tired of eating it.” Li Qiye had to comment.</p>
<p>The old man revealed a simple smile and responded: “Sir, please don’t laugh, but this dish in my shop is a peerless recipe that originated from the Mortal Emperor World. It has been passed down in my home from one generation to another without fail.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye faintly smiled and continued to take his time eating. Of course, he knew where this craft came from more than anyone else.</p>
<p>While savoring the familiar taste in his mouth in this mist-filled shop, it seemed that he had returned to those early years.</p>
<p>In the hazy mist, he could see the two competitive little girls again. One had eyes full of wisdom while the other had a resolute glare.</p>
<p>He suddenly saw the intelligent girl sitting there, quietly eating tofu with him. She didn’t utter a single word, but all that needed to be said had been told.</p>
<p>Eventually, everything disappeared into the rising steam from the hot bowl of tofu. The two girls destined to become the empress and the wise one dispersed.</p>
<p>Everything was in the past; both the empress and the wise goddess had turned to smoke. He was the only one left after the long years.</p>
<p>A while later, he looked up and noticed the Jian Clan was decorated with lanterns and flowers. He asked the old man with an indifferent tone: “Is there a celebration at the Jian Clan?”</p>
<p>“Sir, haven’t you heard?” The old man answered: “The 8,000th birthday of the Jian Grandfather is coming up, everyone from all over the seas are coming to wish him happy birthday.” [1. This is one of those polite appellations with multiple meanings. It is a respectful way to call an old man the (old) leader of a house. It doesn’t have to be blood-related.]</p>
<p>“Jian Grandfather?” Li Qiye glanced at the house and casually asked: “What is his name?”</p>
<p>This made it a bit difficult for the old man. He chuckled and replied: “Sir, did you make your dao debut recently? You don’t know the name of Grandfather? I am only a junior so I don’t dare to say his name.”</p>
<p>“A name is just that.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “As long as your heart holds respect, there’s no need to adhere to such rigid formalities.”</p>
<p>The old man hesitated for a moment before answering: “Grandfather is called Jian Longwei. His Venerableness has led the Jian Clan for several thousand years and is loved by all.”</p>
<p>“Longwei, I see.” Li Qiye lightly said after hearing the name: “It isn’t easy for a Jian disciple to have such a name. It can’t be given at birth.” [2. Longwei = Dragon Protector. A name matters a lot in China, so cool name = cool character, most of the time.]</p>
<p>The old man looked at Li Qiye in astonishment but refrained from commenting.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei was a name full of clout in Heaven Spirit. He was the current master of the Jian Clan and had been in charge for several thousand years. His status was equal to a supreme Godking.</p>
<p>His 8,000th birthday was almost here. At that time, many big shots from all over the world would come to Dragonwell to give him their blessings.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another meaning to his name. Just like Li Qiye said, it wasn’t a name that could be bestowed upon birth.</p>
<p>While Li Qiye continued to eat his tofu, a youth came out of the Jian Clan and sat down in the shop as well.</p>
<p>This youth was very handsome in his violet robe. One could see his bulging muscles underneath them as they exuded a robust feel. However, his strength was not that of a brute but rather a refined type of power.</p>
<p>The youth spoke with a smile: “Uncle, boiled tofu again. I love this dish of yours.”</p>
<p>“Okay, coming up.” The old man smiled and got busy again.</p>
<p>He then brought a bowl for the youth. The fella wasn’t reserved at all and dug in right away. It only took him three to five bites to finish the entire bowl.</p>
<p>After heaving a satisfying belch, he finally noticed Li Qiye inside the shop.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1247: Jian Xiaotie</h4>
<p>Chapter 1247: Jian Xiaotie</p>
<p>While watching Li Qiye’s unhurried manner of eating, the youth couldn’t help but praise: “Brother, you really know how to savor the delicious flavors. The boiled tofu here is really just too good, but I finish way too fast; I’m just a cow chewing on the peony.” [1. Idiom meaning a person is unable to appreciate a delicacy or something more exquisite while they're having it. An English equivalent is casting pearls before swine.]</p>
<p>“A peony-chewing cow is also a type of happiness.” Li Qiye chuckled while looking at the youth. [2. He is saying ignorance is bliss here.]</p>
<p>The youth gave a hearty laugh in response: “Brother, you are quite funny. My name is Jian Xiaotie, what is yours?”</p>
<p>Jiao Xiaotie was a famous name across the Dragon Demon Sea. He was the clan’s young successor.</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye answered flatly and continued eating.</p>
<p>After hearing the name, Jian Xiaotie was quite surprised and immediately stood up while cupping his fists: “Brother Li, the successor of Peacock Land, your prestigious name has been spread far and wide recently.”</p>
<p>“You mean my notoriety?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile freely.</p>
<p>The youth chuckled and replied: “Notoriety is cool too. The Peacock Treefather’s supreme resolution and your unrelenting ways are admirable.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye kept smiling. To him, it wasn’t a big deal if the world continued to think that the blood ceremony was the treefather’s idea.</p>
<p>“It is quite rare to meet another human outside of our clan in Rainbow City, let alone the successor of Peacock Land.” Jian Xiaotie was very excited: “Brother Li, why not come and visit our clan? Our Grandfather’s birthday celebration is in a few more days. At that time, I will take you to see him. He likes young prodigies the most.”</p>
<p>For the younger generation in Heaven Spirit, meeting Jian Longwei was a great honor since he was a very famous Godking in the present times.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t comment any further. Nevertheless, Jian Xiaotie’s enthusiasm didn’t diminish. He quickly handed an invitation card over and said in a serious manner: “This little brother is sincerely inviting you to our Grandfather’s birthday celebration.”</p>
<p>As the main successor, Jian Xiaotie was responsible for preparing his ancestor’s feast. However, he only personally gave invitations to big shots.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie handing one over to Li Qiye himself was enough to show his sincerity.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and accepted the invitation. He finished eating his tofu and paid the bill. He looked at the Jian Clan one last time and softly sighed before leaving.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie watched Li Qiye’s departing back and enthusiastically shouted at him: “Brother Li, you must attend!”</p>
<p>After Li Qiye was long gone, the old man in the shop spoke: “That person is not simple at all.”</p>
<p>Having said that, a flash appeared in his eyes. He no longer looked like an ordinary shopkeeper.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie smilingly said: “Senior Uncle, he is the successor of Peacock Land, a tree controller. Of course he is not simple; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been chosen by an invincible treefather. Him being in charge of Peacock Land is beneficial to the human race since they will have another sanctuary in Heaven Spirit.”</p>
<p>“No, Xiaotie, that’s not what I meant.” The old man shook his head: “He said something that no outsiders should know: that our Grandfather’s name was not given at birth. No one should know this outside of people from the Giant Dragon Kingdom! However, he is definitely not from there.”</p>
<p>“Did he really say that?” Jian Xiaotie was startled as well.</p>
<p>His eyes became quite profound, indicating he was an incredible master. The old man gently shook his head as he slowly revealed: “Grandfather is renowned across the world and everyone knows his name. However, outsiders definitely can’t know that his name was bestowed to him later on.”</p>
<p>“That’s not possible.” Jian Xiaotie replied: “Our clan absolutely wouldn’t tell this to outsiders. The brothers from the Giant Dragon Kingdom don’t mingle with outsiders either — their ancestors are very strict about this. Our clan and their clan, even the most naughty little dragons wouldn’t let this secret out.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said this person is not simple. He definitely knows something, he didn’t only come here to eat my boiled tofu.” The old man became quite cautious.</p>
<p>“Maybe the Peacock Treefather told him.” Jian Xiaotie mused: “The treefather was definitely invincible when he was alive so he might know some of our secrets. After all, Li Qiye is still the Peacock Tree Controller.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it isn’t that simple.” The old man lightly shook his head again: “Even the treefather might not have known our secrets. After all, he died long ago. I’m not sure such knowledge can be passed down either.”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie pondered for a moment before replying: “Uncle, even if he didn’t only come here to eat, it doesn’t mean that he has malicious intentions. Our Jian Clan has always been friendly with rest of the human race.”</p>
<p>The old man spoke: “It is better to be careful. If anything happens during Grandfather’s celebration, then we would be letting Grandfather down as useless juniors.”</p>
<p>“I will be careful.” Jian Xiaotie nodded earnestly.</p>
<p>After leaving the little shop, Li Qiye headed for the Rainbow Pavilion. In fact, the old man and Jian Xiaotie were overthinking things; he really did only go to eat the boiled tofu. He had no intention to do anything to the Jian Clan.</p>
<p>Li Qiye took out the invitation and murmured: “Maybe I should go take a look. It will be our last meeting, there might not be another chance in the future...”</p>
<p>After entering the inn, he found that Zhang Baitu had already taken care of everything.</p>
<p>“You have just learned a dao, so stay here for now and carefully ponder it.” Li Qiye ordered: “After a few more days, I will take you to the Jian Clan. It will be good for you to get to know the disciples there.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble, you want to attend the Jian Grandfather’s birthday?” Zhang Baitu was surprised to hear this. Normally, a nobody like him wouldn’t be qualified to attend a celebration of this level.</p>
<p>“Yes, it will be good to broaden your horizons.” Li Qiye insipidly said: “Your three clans have deep ties with the Jian Clan. However, some unfilial descendants dragged down Dongting Lake, so the Jian Clan wanted nothing to do with you all.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at Zhang Baitu and continued: “Remember this, as a descendant of the Zhang Clan, cultivation is only one aspect, you need to maintain a certain state of mind as well. Remember, if you want to be accepted by others, cultivation alone won’t be enough. You need to have the same resolution as your ancestors. Otherwise, it would be throwing away their past glory and shaming their reputation.”</p>
<p>“This lowly one will continue to work towards your goals. I won’t let you down.” Zhang Baitu kneeled and answered respectfully.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded quietly.</p>
<p>While these two were staying at the inn, Dragonwell became even more lively. Its streets could only be described as being occupied by a sea of people.</p>
<p>This was because Jian Longwei’s 8,000th birthday was coming up. Many great powers from all corners of the world sent their important characters to give him their blessings.</p>
<p>His pivotal status and the respect he garnered from all the races in Heaven Spirit was not only because he was the leader of the Jian Clan, he was also a Godking. Some even say that he was at the incredible Celestial Godking level.</p>
<p>Great lineages such as Gu Chun’s four branches, the Seven Martial Pavilion, and the Swiftdao Holy Ground all sent people as well. A few guests garnered a lot of attention. For example, Shangguan Feiyan from the Roaring Conch and Gongsun Meiyu from the Profound Sea Dynasty. People couldn’t turn their eyes away.</p>
<p>Today, both of these supreme beauties with deep friendships came together. Their appearance at the birthday celebration in Dragonwell created a very pretty scene when they walked together.</p>
<p>The public praised them as magnificent head-turners. Shangguan Feiyan was very famous at the Dragon Demon Sea for being a genius of the Roaring Conch. Needless to say more about Gongsun Meiyu, she was the Profound Monarch’s concubine. Her charm seeped deep into the bones.</p>
<p>The crowd started cheering when they presented their gifts.</p>
<p>“Miss Shangguan represents the Roaring Conch in gifting a Phoenix Conch in honor of the Grandfather.” A disciple responsible for accepting gifts accepted the item and recorded it down.</p>
<p>“Miss Gongsun represents the God-Monarch in gifting a Longevity Seadeer in honor of the Grandfather.” After hearing the announcement from this disciple, many in the audience marveled.</p>
<p>“The Phoenix Conch and Longevity Seadeer are both exceedingly rare treasures.” Some were quite envious of the two gifts.</p>
<p>They felt that only behemoths like the Roaring Conch and Profound Sea Dynasty would be able to afford such gifts.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the generous presents.” Jian Xiaotie personally received the two girls.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1248: Hong Tianzhu</h4>
<p>Chapter 1248: Hong Tianzhu</p>
<p>While Li Qiye was still at the Rainbow Pavilion, Zhang Baitu was striking while the iron was hot in order to comprehend the grand dao he saw earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, Li Qiye was not in a rush to attend the birthday celebration. It was not his main purpose for coming here.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao came as well. Her father was with her, along with some disciples from the lake. He was the current master of the lake, Hong Tianzhu. [1. Tianzhu = Celestial/Heavenly Pillar.]</p>
<p>Despite his domineering name, he was not a tall or muscular man. White hair could already be found on his head. Despite his humble stature, he gave off a shrewd and capable feeling instead of looking like a pushover.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li, this is my father.” Hong Yujiao introduced him to Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was sitting in the lobby and only nodded. He didn’t bother to stand up after seeing Hong Tianzhu. Hong Tianzhu cupped his fists and said: “Virtuous Nephew, your fame is thunderous. It is a type of fate to be able to see you today.”</p>
<p>At this time, Hong Yujiao left with the other disciples because she knew her father wanted to talk to Li Qiye.</p>
<p>However, before she could leave, Li Qiye interrupted: “Yujiao, stay behind. You need to listen as well.”</p>
<p>She was slightly dazed and looked over at her father before deciding to stay behind.</p>
<p>In just a moment, only the three of them were left in the lobby.</p>
<p>After everyone sat down, Li Qiye looked at Hong Tianzhu and spoke: “I heard Yujiao say that you wanted to meet me to talk about something. What is it about?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu carefully took a glimpse at Li Qiye again. The guy was sitting there imperiously as if he was guarding the entire world. Anyone would feel an uncomfortable vibe after seeing Li Qiye’s attitude. After all, he was only a junior, yet he was so arrogant. Not too many would appreciate this kind of gesture.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to think too much.” Li Qiye broke the silence: “Don’t think that I would give you more consideration just because you are the current master of Dongting Lake. I granted you this audience not because of how strong your lake is, but purely because of the blessing of your ancestors. I’m here to give Dongting Lake a chance.”</p>
<p>Such words would drive many people away in exasperation. After all, Hong Tianzhu was the leader of an entire region. He enjoyed a great status with his position, but today, someone told him that this meeting was only out of respect for his ancestors. This was simply demeaning and humiliating. No one would like to hear such words.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression slightly shifted after hearing Li Qiye. It would be a lie to say that he was unaffected by these claims. However, as an experienced leader, he didn’t become angry and feel the need to defend his prestige.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li, I respect your status and your character.” Even Hong Yujiao had to defend her father: “But please, show some respect to us and our Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>Her displeasure was warranted. He might as well be pointing straight at her father’s face and criticizing him. As his daughter, she naturally had to uphold his dignity.</p>
<p>“Yujiao, the fact that I am sitting right here is showing respect to both you two and your Dongting Lake!” Li Qiye opened his eyes wider. A brilliance instantly blossomed like the flashing of a star. The world floated around his divine throne that loomed above the nine heavens.</p>
<p>He glared at her and slowly uttered: “You think I would bother to correct some randoms on the street and give them a chance at a fortune?”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao was shaken when Li Qiye glared at her like this. Even though he was only sitting there, she felt an immense pressure, rendering her breathless and giving her the urge to prostrate before him. This was a very strange feeling.</p>
<p>She heaved a sigh of relief once he took his eyes away. The suppressive atmosphere slowly dispersed and she woke up from this trance.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe it. This Li Qiye ahead looked even younger than her. Despite his ordinary appearance, he could actually instill a primal fear in her, like an eternal existence.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu took a deep breath and subdued his displeasure. He cupped his fists again and said: “Virtuous Nephew, the truth is that I did come here today with a particular topic in mind.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly replied: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu paused for a moment before speaking: “You are the disciple of the Peacock Treefather, the current successor of Peacock Land. My Dongting Lake wishes to formalize a pact with your land.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye slightly raised his eyebrows and asked: “A pact?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu elaborated: “With your consent, we will send disciples to Peacock Land to start a training garrison so that they can become accustomed to the mainland. This will also deepen the friendship between our two lands. Of course, you can also send disciples to my Dongting Lake so that they can train and get used to the sea as well.”</p>
<p>Even though Dongting Lake was huge, its actual landmass was far smaller than Peacock Land. There were more lakes than anything else here. Meanwhile, Peacock Land was one of the biggest continents in not just the Jade Sea, but the entire Heaven Spirit World. There was a reason why it was considered such a great haven for the human race.</p>
<p>However, despite its great size, Peacock Land has never allowed outsiders to be stationed within its territory. No one dared to challenge the Peacock Treefather’s authority in this regard either.</p>
<p>“There are not many humans in Heaven Spirit. Our Dongting Lake and your Peacock Land are two of the biggest strongholds of our race. You should know that if we cooperate with each other, it will not only be beneficial for our lands, but also for the entire human race.” He finished his suggestion.</p>
<p>“I am actually not an acrimonious person.” Li Qiye said with an indifferent tone: “But you yourself should be laughing at how ridiculous your statement is. Your clans have been vying for power all this time, scheming for all kinds of positions. Don’t you think its funny when your lake talks about the interests of the human race?”</p>
<p>“You can’t even tolerate and accept your own people, what is this talk about helping others?!” He coldly stared at Hong Tianzhu after stating this.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s face turned red to the point of being slightly ugly after hearing this.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li, you are speaking out of line.” Hong Yujiao once more interjected on her father’s behalf.</p>
<p>Li Qiye shifted his glare to her and responded: “Your Dongting Lake needs to reflect on this issue. Go back and tell those old geezers there what I have said today. I initially didn’t want to talk about this kind of nonsense as it's not even worth a fart in my eyes!”</p>
<p>His glare was chilling at this moment: “However, I will give your lake a chance out of respect for your ancestors. Go back and tell those old bones that if they don’t wake up, I will personally take action!”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu rose from his seat and lowered his voice: “Young Noble Li, your words are too condescending. My lake will take care of our own business. If you do not wish to befriend us, then forget it. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“Sit down!” The glint in Li Qiye’s eyes bloomed. An oppressive atmosphere came from his eyes; it was as if they could annihilate eternity itself. Hong Tianzhu seemed to be imprisoned by gods from the glare.</p>
<p>He involuntarily sat back down with a bang as if a hand of god had directly pushed him down.</p>
<p>“You still don’t understand.” Li Qiye continued his scolding: “Do you really think the phrase “protected by the wise sages of the Hundred-Saints Hall” is merely empty words? When was the last time you all visited and worshiped the souls of your ancestors?”</p>
<p>“The wise sages of the Hundred-Saints Hall?” He couldn’t come up with an answer right away, but he knew of this particular phrase.</p>
<p>“Forget it.” Li Qiye gently sighed: “I am too lazy to care about you all. If you want to work together with Peacock Land, I will show you the way by writing a letter to Kong Qinru of the Exquisite Valley. She will make the necessary arrangements for you.”</p>
<p>“The Exquisite Valley Lord?” Hong Tianzhu was taken aback.</p>
<p>He didn’t know the relationship between Li Qiye and Kong Qinru. In theory, Li Qiye was the successor of Peacock Land, so he should be in charge of this business.</p>
<p>“Go, Qinru will assist you.” Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve.</p>
<p>He was tired of this problem with Dongting Lake. Only his love for their ancestors kept him involved.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu hesitated and asked: “Well, will the Exquisite Valley agree to assist us in this matter?” He felt that he by himself was not enough to deal with the valley.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but look at him and ask: “Don’t tell me you haven’t been communicating with the Exquisite Valley?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu rubbed his palms together awkwardly and replied: “Our Dongting Lake do have some dealings with the Exquisite Valley, but, but it is only by chance most of the time.”</p>
<p>He became a bit embarrassed at this point and didn’t know what else to say.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1249: Contract</h4>
<p>Chapter 1249: Contract</p>
<p>Li Qiye noticed Hong Tianzhu’s awkward demeanor and flatly said: “I understand now. You no longer have the contract from back then! It was written by the ancestors from the Zhang Clan, so their withdrawal cut off the alliance between you and the Exquisite Valley!”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?!” Hong Tianzhu was shocked to hear this. This was a story so ancient that even their lake had almost forgotten about it.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu wouldn’t have recalled this matter if Li Qiye didn’t bring up working together with the Exquisite Valley. Even juniors from the lake didn’t know about this contract, let alone outsiders.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t answer his question directly: “After severing this contract, your lake’s descendants didn’t have the ability to form another one. In the end, the valley stopped caring about your lake.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s old face became a bit hot. He coughed and said: “I, I won’t deny that. Dongting Lake is indeed inferior compared to the past. We descendants have not done well, so the lake isn’t strong like before. This inevitably made others underestimate us.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu sighed after saying this. Suddenly, he felt as if he was one generation below Li Qiye in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sighed as well and stared at Hong Tianzhu. He couldn’t give up on him, so he pointed the way for him: “The valley didn’t ignore you because of the decline. Even though the Zhang ancestors were the ones who signed the contract, the Hong and Xu ancestors were most likely involved in passing it down as well.”</p>
<p>“Take a moment to reflect on what your lake has become. The clans are distancing themselves from each other, and all of you have long forgotten the teachings of your ancestors. Today, one clan will be on top, tomorrow, another will take its place. Everything has become such a mess with a total failure to comply with your legacy’s own teachings.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye paused before continuing: “With this abandonment, your sect has become chaotic. All of its energy and resources are consumed by internal conflicts, do you feel that your lake can still be powerful under these conditions?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu was a bit tongue-tied after hearing this.</p>
<p>“The lake was built upon the labor of all three clans. Without this system that was fortified by an agreement, your group is nothing more than a bunch of stray dogs competing for a piece of meat! Think about it, the continuous changes in leadership in such a capricious manner rendered the entire system useless. Do you think the valley would want to be involved with your lake under these circumstances? Each of your clans has their own agenda while lacking the will to carry out a strategy that will benefit the entire lake as a whole.”</p>
<p>“I…” Hong Tianzhu didn’t know how to respond.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently sighed: “It is not impossible to form an alliance with the Exquisite Valley. The descendants of your clans need to sit down. Let go of what should be abandoned, do what must be done, follow your lineage’s old teachings and become a solidary whole once more. Repent and more opportunities shall arise.”</p>
<p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu hesitated. He didn’t know why Li Qiye knew so many things about them, but he was taking Li Qiye much more seriously.</p>
<p>He eventually said: “Young Noble, this isn’t that simple. Even if I want to reform the union, the other ancestors might not necessarily agree. Moreover, the clans themselves might not be willing to follow the ancestral teachings again.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s remark was not unreasonable. After all, who would be willing to give up their power after being in charge? This was simply asking for the impossible.</p>
<p>No one could withstand the temptation of power. This was precisely the reason why several generations later, the lake abandoned their teachings and contended over resources and authority. This led to the chaos in the lake and, not long after this, many long-term agreements could no longer be sustained.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nonchalantly replied: “Let the souls of your ancestors decide in accordance with their ironclad teachings. Kill those who dare to disobey without showing mercy.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu was dazed after hearing this. It sounded like a joke, but he didn’t dare to say it.</p>
<p>The souls of the ancestors were an intangible and spiritual matter. It was only a way of commemorating the ancestors and their glorious achievements.</p>
<p>It was impossible to seek these spirits and ask for their arbitration. Who would listen to such an ethereal idea?</p>
<p>“It seems like you all don’t even know what you have lost.” Li Qiye shook his head and said: “After abandoning your union and contract, even the ancestors have been forgotten. It’s no wonder why the valley looks down on your lake. It has thrown away all of its ancestors’ prestige and even the most precious inheritance they left behind. Why would the valley care about you?”</p>
<p>“You think that the Hundred-Saints Hall is storing treasures, right?” Li Qiye coldly stared at Hong Tianzhu.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu became quite embarrassed. Some of their ancestors did think that the hall stored treasures. Some of them had even tried to open it to no avail.</p>
<p>Li Qiye felt a bit helpless at these descendants and told Hong Tianzhu: “Then let me ask you, has your lake been worshiping the souls of the ancestors and the lake itself?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu coughed awkwardly and couldn’t say anything for a long time.</p>
<p>The frustrated Li Qiye shook his head and said: “I don’t know what to say regarding your stupidity. If I was your ancestor, I would surely strangle you group of fools with only power in your eyes!”</p>
<p>“Do you actually think that you have been able to defend Dongting Lake because it has a superb defensive terrain with your insignificant strength? Don’t you know how important this treasure ground is? Your ancestors expended countless efforts in order to obtain it. In the Dragon Demon Sea, all of the great lineages like the Seven Martial Pavilion, the Roaring Conch, and the Dream Empyrean could easily destroy the lake whenever they want!”</p>
<p>He went on to say: “Do you think defending the lake is to your group’s credit? To put it bluntly, the Dream Empyrean’s Meng Zhentian can easily annihilate you all by himself, so why is it that none of them have maneuvered against the lake? Is it because of your few contemporary ancestors? Haha, in the eyes of others, these ancestors are no different from insects.</p>
<p>“The real reason why your lake has survived till now is due to the souls of your ancestors protecting everyone. Because of them, your enemies do not dare to act recklessly! Without their protection, within this Dragon Demon Sea where the sea demons reign supreme, you ants would have been treated like fat pieces of meat and torn asunder by a group of bloodthirsty sharks!”</p>
<p>He snorted sarcastically as he finished his monologue: “But today, you have forgotten about their souls! To actually not be performing the lake ceremony as well as worshipping your ancestors… how ridiculous!”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu stood there murmuring to himself: “The souls of the ancestors…?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head again with frustration: “You can’t be thinking that their souls are just an intangible concept?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu smiled wryly and had no response again. Hong Yujiao, sitting to the side, couldn’t comment either because she didn’t know about the souls of the ancestors. As for the teachings and contract, she wasn’t privy to them either. Many of the current elders in the lake didn’t want to mention them.</p>
<p>Of course, it was their direct ancestors who chose to abandon these rules in favor of power; they naturally wouldn’t want to bring it up again.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu mustered up his courage and asked after some musing: “Young Noble, if we were to let the souls of the ancestors make the decision, how do we go about it?”</p>
<p>“Do you really have the determination?” Li Qiye looked at him and said: “Right now, your Hong Clan has a lot of power at the lake and the Xu also have several docks, right? The poorest among the clans is the Zhang, they don’t even have a place to stay despite the lake being so large.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu didn’t know too much about the power struggle back then either, but he had heard a few things about it. Even though the Zhang ancestors lost, they still had one dock remaining out of the eighteen. However, these ancestors were furious at that time and chose to leave Dongting Lake. The rest of them then divided the Zhang Clan's assets; this wasn’t a proud event at all.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nonchalantly looked at him and said: “Will your Hong Clan be willing to give up your power and resources?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu eventually answered: “I don’t know what the ancestors will say, but you are right, our lake is indeed in disarray due to the power struggles. We only do what we want, so many of our covenants and pacts with others can’t be implemented. If this keeps up, the lake will be even more fragmented and become weaker.”</p>
<p>“I understand after listening to you today.” He gently sighed: “We must be the ones to reshape the order of the lake. Otherwise, no one will respect us.”</p>
<p>As the master of the lake, he understood that many of their current agreements couldn’t be carried out at all.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1250: Marriage Proposal</h4>
<p>Chapter 1250: Marriage Proposal</p>
<p>Li Qiye watched over Hong Tianzhu for a bit before speaking: “Very well, if you are truly sincere, then it will be for the best. I will give your lake one last chance; if you can’t seize it, then you are on your own in the future.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu became excited and quickly bowed: “Thank you, Young Noble.”</p>
<p>Even though he knew neither what Li Qiye was capable of or about the souls of the ancestors, his intuition was telling him that this was a once-in-a-million-years opportunity for their lake. If they were to miss it, then they would truly be on the verge of a real decline.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao was also confused at this moment. They didn’t know who this man was, but she felt an unfathomable aura from him. When he sat there, it seemed as if he was the master of all. Both she and her father felt their statuses lowered while he would remain the same for all eternity.</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked Hong Tianzhu: “Did you come to Dragonwell to celebrate the Jian Clan’s birthday?”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu quickly answered: “Young Noble, you are correct. Our lake was invited for the 8,000th birthday, so we came to give the Jian Grandfather our blessings.”</p>
<p>“Very well, we’ll go together then. Having an audience with the Grandfather will be good.” Li Qiye gently nodded: “As for whether you can build a friendship with the Jian Clan in the future or not, that will depend on your own fortune.”</p>
<p>“Meet the Grandfather?” Hong Tianzhu was both excited and nervous. Even though their lake did have some ties with the Jian Clan, it was a very shallow relationship.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the only reason they were invited to this celebration was most likely because they were also humans.</p>
<p>Their lake was not qualified to see the Grandfather alone. This was something left to behemoths like the Seven Martial Pavilion and Roaring Conch.</p>
<p>How could he not be shocked by this development? It was truly a good opportunity for Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please stop, our master is in a meeting.” The voice of a disciple from the lake came from outside.</p>
<p>But before this disciple could finish, the person had already barged inside. The intruder was the Wyvern Crown Prince, Shangguan Feilong.</p>
<p>The disciple outside couldn’t exactly stop him, so they were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu and Hong Yujiao were surprised to see this sudden intrusion and slightly frowned.</p>
<p>After coming inside, Shangguan Feilong felt annoyed when he saw Li Qiye and snorted. However, he didn’t push it further and decided to ignore Li Qiye. He cupped his fist towards the other two and said: “Uncle, Sister, please excuse my rude interruption, I was simply too anxious.”</p>
<p>The deed was done, so despite feeling unhappy, Hong Tianzhu managed to ask: “Nephew, is there an important event?”</p>
<p>Shangguan Feilong was visually happy. He bowed and carefully spoke: “My big sis wants to invite you to the Jian Clan to talk about the marriage between Sister and me.”</p>
<p>“What marriage?” Hong Yujiao’s expression shifted.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu grimaced as well and said: “Nephew, this joke is going too far. It is too early to talk about marriage.”</p>
<p>“Uncle, it isn’t early.” Shangguan Feilong gloated: “My big sis has sent messages to the ancestors of the lake, and they have agreed. Moreover, our marriage will be administered by the Seashield Prince.”</p>
<p>Both the father and daughter were alarmed upon hearing this sudden development. They couldn’t react in time.</p>
<p>“The ancestors of the lake have high hopes for this marriage and wish for it to happen soon.” The happy youth spoke: “My big sis heard that Uncle was staying at Dragonwell, so she told me to come and invite you to the Jian Clan to discuss things further.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu raised his brows and asked in a serious manner: “When did the ancestors agree to this?”</p>
<p>“Just a while ago.” Shangguan Feilong was all smiles: “Sister and I are a perfect match. This marriage is a match made in heaven—”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao coldly interrupted him: “I’ll be in charge of my own marriage, the ancestors don’t need to worry about it.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao was quite dissatisfied with the ancestors from the lake suddenly deciding her marriage for her.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu felt the same way, evident by his grimace. He understood why the ancestors agreed so quickly. To a large extent, it was due to Feilong’s older sister, Shangguan Feiyan.</p>
<p>She was one of the most excellent geniuses of the Roaring Conch. Plus, there had been rumors of her marrying her senior brother, the Seashield Prince, to become the future mistress of that sect.</p>
<p>If the lake could form this marriage pact with the Wyvern Country, they would also be able to suck up to the Roaring Conch. It would be very beneficial to have such a strong backing.</p>
<p>However, he was not happy about this marriage. His daughter had the most excellent bloodline among the lake’s younger generation. He naturally didn’t want their Hong Clan’s best bloodline to go to a foreign race.</p>
<p>Shangguan Feilong quickly responded to Hong Yujiao: “Sister, we are childhood friends. You have the best bloodline while I will inherit the Wyvern Country. Our children will be dragons and phoenixes amongst men, they could even inherit the true dragon’s bloodline from my forefathers…”</p>
<p>“Since when did the Wyvern Country have a true dragon’s bloodline?” A very blunt voice interrupted Feilong. Li Qiye coldly commented: “A little snake crawling up from the seabed dares to claim to be a true dragon?!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t show Feilong any respect: “The Wyvern Country is nothing. How can it be qualified to marry a daughter from the Hong Clan? When the ancestors from the Hong Clan lorded over the world, your forefather was only a little snake at the bottom of the ocean!”</p>
<p>“You!” Feilong’s expression became quite unsightly after the hurtful words. He furiously pointed at Li Qiye and spat: “Li, don’t think you’re all that because you're the Peacock Tree’s disciple. It can only be invincible at Peacock Land and will never be able to leave! Without its protection, you are nothing and can be killed at any time!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was too lazy to give him another glance. He stood up and told Hong Yujiao: “Your marriage is for you to decide. Those geezers from the lake are hopelessly stupid; in order to gain a backing, they are willing to give up their best bloodline to a foreign race as a cauldron! Truly a bunch of idiots.”</p>
<p>“If you want to marry, then do it. If you don’t, then you don’t have to worry about anyone forcing you! Just let me know and I shall deal with them. These other races are not qualified to marry the excellent bloodline of the Hong Clan!” Having said that, he walked towards the door.</p>
<p>Feilong was enraged by Li Qiye and shouted: “Motherfucker, I dare you to say that again!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored him and left the lobby.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu quickly consoled him: “Nephew, a marriage is a happy event, but it is also very important. Wait until I come back and talk to the ancestors to figure things out, then I’ll meet your sister. Of course, I’ll probably see her at the birthday celebration anyway.”</p>
<p>“Uncle, after this feast, my sister will be going back to the Roaring Conch. She wants to arrange the marriage before leaving.” Feilong had to ignore Li Qiye and replied to Hong Tianzhu: “If this can be done, she can also invite the Seashield Prince to preside over our wedding.”</p>
<p>“I understand your eagerness as well as Miss Shangguan’s line of thought.” Hong Tianzhu was conflicted. The ancestors didn’t bother talking to him before deciding his daughter’s marriage.</p>
<p>He continued to appease Feilong: “Don’t worry, I will give your sister a definite answer before she leaves.”</p>
<p>It took a while before Tianzhu managed to calm Feilong down and send him away.</p>
<p>“The ancestors are too unreasonable. How can they make a decision about my marriage like this!” Hong Yujiao expressed her dissatisfaction after Feilong’s departure.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu sighed and insipidly said: “Do you still not see it? There is only one reason why the ancestors from our Hong and Xu Clans could reach an agreement in such a short amount of time. Even though we have a lot of power in the lake right now, several of our Hong ancestors are near the end of their lifespans. If they die, then the Xu Clan will have a chance to close the gap. The Roaring Conch is the most powerful lineage right now with a great amount of divine medicine. If I’m not mistaken, the ancestors must have reached an agreement with Shangguan Feiyan; they want to use this marriage to trade for some medicine!”</p>
<p>He sighed helplessly after coming to this conclusion.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1251: Bloodshark Scion</h4>
<p>Chapter 1251: Bloodshark Scion</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao felt gloomy after hearing her father.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu continued his explanation while feeling frustrated: “As for the ancestors from the Xu Clan, it is pretty easy to guess why they are in favor of this marriage. Among the younger generations, your bloodline is the most exceptional with the highest chance for atavism! If you stay at the lake, you will have a better chance than anyone else to inherit my mantle and become the next master of the lake…”</p>
<p>“... As you can imagine, if our Hong Clan were to stay in power, the other clans will not be happy. This is why they were able to reach an agreement about the marriage proposal so quickly!” He sighed after finishing his explanation.</p>
<p>She voiced her displeasure: “Our ancestors are too outrageous. I am not an object!”</p>
<p>Tianzhu continued with a hint of helplessness: “Despite being together, our clans have always sought power. It has been many years since we were last united. Young Noble Li was right about why others look down on us. Our clans are not doing a good job of operating the lake; everyone is only after their own interests and small gains.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps this is the time for us to change. Otherwise, we will die from infighting before an enemy has the chance to destroy us.” His eyes became determined after stating this.</p>
<p>She worriedly responded: “Father, I’m afraid the ancestors will not agree to reuniting our clans and obeying our past teachings. Even our own ancestors won’t allow you to do so.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Tianzhu gently sighed: “But what else can we do? Do we keep on watching the internal struggle until our demise?”</p>
<p>He lowered his tone here: “As for the marriage, I will personally discuss it with them. Their actions were too unreasonable this time…”</p>
<p>Having said that, he contemplated quietly for a while.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days passed in the blink of an eye. Zhang Baitu had finally comprehended his own dao and was overjoyed by his success. Not even in his wildest dreams did he imagine that such a day would come.</p>
<p>He left his closed cultivation since the birthday celebration was swiftly approaching. Together with Li Qiye, he went to the Jian Clan along with Hong Tianzhu, Hong Yujiao, and some disciples from the lake.</p>
<p>At this time, Dragonwell City was quite lively. People crowded together along the streets. This was especially true for the Jian Mansion. Carriages were everywhere with people coming and going.</p>
<p>Guests from all over the seas came to wish happy birthday to the Jian Grandfather. Even imperial lineages created by sea gods and Immortal Emperors were no exceptions.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the mansion, Li Qiye’s group met Feilong along the way. It seemed that he intended to walk together with them.</p>
<p>“Uncle, Sister.” Feilong cupped his fists and greeted them while only giving a cold humph towards Li Qiye.</p>
<p>He didn’t wish to provoke Li Qiye this time. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Li Qiye even though Li Qiye was the disciple of the Peacock Tree. After all, his big sis was the genius of the Roaring Conch, so his backing was quite amazing as well.</p>
<p>This time, he was accompanied by another young man. This young man had a stout stature with a sharp pair of eyes. There seemed to be an ethereal bloody mist hovering around him.</p>
<p>Feilong introduced him: “Uncle, this is the Bloodshark Scion, you probably recognize him.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao and the rest of the lake’s disciples trembled a bit. The Bloodshark Village was very famous in the Heaven Spirit World. Moreover, it was right next to the Wyvern Country.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it was more powerful than Wyvern. Wyvern was relatively milder in their conduct while this village was notorious for its cruelty. They often attacked smaller factions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of its ancestors was the Bloodshark Sovereign, a very terrifying existence. Rumor has it that in his youth, he was once recognized by the Trident. However, for some unknown reason, the Trident abandoned him so he ultimately couldn’t become a sea god.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his status at the Dragon Demon Sea was still untouchable. Other great powers had no desire to provoke him.</p>
<p>“Sect Master Hong, nice to meet you. In the future, we will be in-laws. Your lake’s problems will be my Bloodshark Village’s problems.” This scion was even more arrogant than Feilong as he cupped his fists and smiled.</p>
<p>“In-laws? Why do you say that?” Hong Tianzhu furrowed his brows. It seemed like many interesting events were happening all at once.</p>
<p>Feilong was the one who answered: “Uncle, you haven’t heard yet, but the Lin Clan has betrothed their golden daughter to him.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression sank after hearing this. He was left in the dark despite being the sect master. It looked like the Lin Clan didn’t want to let the other clans know about it.</p>
<p>He also understood that they did this in order to oppose the Hong Clan. If, say, his daughter was to actually marry Shangguan Feilong, then it wouldn’t only be a marriage with Wyvern, they would also gain the favor of the Roaring Conch.</p>
<p>This marriage was a source of worry for the other clans at Dongting Lake. Because of this, the Lin Clan, a sect relatively close to the lake, was the first to have a marriage alliance with the Bloodshark Village.</p>
<p>He secretly lamented after realizing this. Many clans didn’t even hesitate to cooperate with outsiders for power.</p>
<p>At this time, the scion’s eyes fell upon a female disciple. Even though she couldn’t be described as kingdom-toppling, she still grew up to be quite beautiful with a graceful bearing like an orchid in a valley.</p>
<p>His eyes lit up right away as he stared in an overbearing and rude manner.</p>
<p>“You must be Sister Lin. We shall be a great couple after getting married.” The scion laughed and said: “You have a holy bloodline while I have a sea god’s bloodline. Our marriage will be a perfect matrimony.”</p>
<p>This scion was proving to be even more arrogant and overbearing than Shangguan Feilong.</p>
<p>For this trip, Hong Tianzhu brought along the most excellent disciples among the younger generation. He wanted them to get to know the youths from the Jian Clan.</p>
<p>This miss with the surname Lin was a brilliant disciple. At this time, the scion’s stare caused her discomfort. She couldn’t help but hide behind Hong Yujiao.</p>
<p>The scion’s words were quite imposing. He spoke as if she was already his incubator, angering the other disciples. Alas, they didn’t dare to speak up.</p>
<p>The scion ignored the glares from these disciples and remained haughty as he dismissively said: “This marriage is very beneficial to your Dongting Lake. This is the lake’s honor.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu snorted at this comment, but he remained calm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye who was watching indifferently on the sideline couldn’t help but shake his head. These foolish ancestors from the clans back at Dongting Lake were incurable. They didn’t mind working together with outsiders to grab power. This was the same as inviting wolves to their own home!</p>
<p>Such a hungry wolf was standing before them, evidenced by his invasive gaze at the young lady from the Lin Clan. The Bloodshark Scion smiled and said: “After the celebration, you should come with me to the Bloodshark Village. I’ll take you to see our customs.”</p>
<p>The young girl was still hiding behind Hong Yujiao while feeling disgusted by the scion’s eyes that resembled those of a hungry wolf. She felt both angry and helpless because her own ancestors had betrothed her to the village!</p>
<p>At this time, Li Qiye began again with an insipid tone: “Bloodshark Village? Only a lowly race that enjoys feasting on rotten corpses. It took you forever to be able to come out of the water, yet you are here acting all pompous? Your lowly race is not qualified to marry one of my people! Scram to the side!”</p>
<p>Despite his initial stance of not caring for Dongting Lake, he couldn’t bear to watch any longer. He had decided to personally rectify the problems those foolish ancestors had caused Dongting Lake!</p>
<p>His comment came to Miss Lin’s rescue. Many disciples felt quite pleased to hear it because they couldn’t speak out against the order of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The Bloodshark Scion became heated right away. He turned around and coldly exclaimed: “You are that brat, the disciple of the Peacock Tree? It isn’t here right now, so don’t think you cannot be offended! Anyone can kill you right now!”</p>
<p>A chilling glint flashed across his eyes after issuing the threat.</p>
<p>Li Qiye suddenly smiled back. This was a smile that made Hong Tianzhu’s heart skip a beat. He suddenly felt an ominous foreboding because he had heard of the blood ceremony that Li Qiye and the treefather carried out.</p>
<p>“Let us go to the Jian Mansion.” He quickly interjected in order to remind both the scion and Li Qiye.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1252: Birthday Celebration</h4>
<p>Chapter 1252: Birthday Celebration</p>
<p>Shangguan Feilong also stopped the Bloodshark Scion from fighting and quickly added: “Scion, there’s no need to bother with a scoundrel like this. It will only ruin the mood of the Grandfather’s birthday, that wouldn’t be good.”</p>
<p>The scion glanced at the Jian Mansion not too far away and grunted to call it a day. Everyone had to be reserved at the Jian Mansion.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, his head is already claimed.” Feilong grinned and told Li Qiye: “We won’t bother with you for now, but don’t be happy for long. Queen Gongsun has already claimed your head. She has released a message about taking your head to sacrifice to her maid!”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao and the rest of the disciples from the lake were aghast. Even Hong Tianzhu was a little stirred. He naturally knew who Queen Gongsun was; as the concubine of the Profound God-Monarch, her backing was the monstrous Profound Dynasty.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is she?” Li Qiye didn’t even bat an eye and simply didn’t take it to heart.</p>
<p>The rest of his group had no comments. The guy was too domineering. Among the younger generation, who would dare to make such a remark about Gongsun Meiyu?</p>
<p>“Haha, ignorant fool. No one will be able to save you once the queen is here.” Feilong smiled deviously.</p>
<p>In fact, it was him who told Meiyu about Li Qiye’s presence at Dragonwell. If Meiyu wasn’t preoccupied with meeting the big characters from the Jian Clan, she would have already tried to take his head as revenge for her maid, Gongsun Qianer.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, we are here.” Hong Tianzhu noticed the sparks in the air and quickly interrupted them when they made it to the entrance.</p>
<p>The Jian disciples were welcoming guests. These disciples were very knowledgeable and quickly greeted the group: “Master Hong, Bloodshark Scion, welcome to our humble abode…”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu returned the gesture. Even the Bloodshark Scion didn’t dare to act presumptuously before the Jian Clan. He politely conversed with these disciples. As for Feilong, he had been here already to deliver his gift, so he was very familiar with these disciples.</p>
<p>While the others were talking with the Jian disciples, Miss Lin came next to Li Qiye and whispered: “Thank you for earlier.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye took a look at this gentle girl and noticed her slightly embarrassed demeanor. He sighed in his mind.</p>
<p>In the past, these clans were completely united under one legion. Their battalions formed by their disciples once threatened the world with many great expeditions. Part of their prestige came from their integrity and open-mindedness which attracted many human experts to join them.</p>
<p>However, many years have passed and their descendants suffer from internal conflicts. They were now fish on the chopping block in the eyes of many!</p>
<p>While Li Qiye was recalling the past, the young lady reminded him: “Let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>The rest of the group that were talking to the Jian disciples earlier had already entered. The remaining disciples from the lake followed them inside as well.</p>
<p>Li Qiye and Miss Lin walked up the steps. While standing beneath the entrance, Li Qiye looked up to look at the plaque. It was a very simple wooden board with the word “Jian” written on it. It contained an extraordinary divinity.</p>
<p>That happy and outgoing smile with a hint of craftiness always accompanied her laughter. This laughter was too difficult to forget, always ringing in his ears when he looked at the plaque.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, the ruler of the universe and adjudicator of the Heaven’s Will, how about leaving behind a word to protect my Jian Clan’s descendants?” The wily girl blinked with a pair of wise eyes that seemed like they could speak. She smiled and continued: “I won’t ask for you to protect them, only that if one day, our descendants blindly maneuver against you, you will think about this character “Jian” and spare their lives.”</p>
<p>The past seemed like it was just yesterday. Her unforgettable voice and posture still lingered in his heart. He gently sighed while looking at the word on the plaque and thought to himself: “Little girl, why did you have to try so hard back then? All of that just to scheme for little Hong Tian. If I wanted to obtain my body from the Immortal Demon Grotto, I would have done so long ago.”</p>
<p>During his melancholic reminiscence, Hong Tianzhu had presented his gift. It was not a stunning present, but it also didn’t throw away the lake’s reputation. It was right around the middle of the pack.</p>
<p>The Bloodshark Scion also presented a treasure box with a blood pearl inside. He was very proud of his present and stated: “My ancestors can’t personally come to wish Senior Jian a happy birthday, so they allowed me to bring this Bloodshark Divine Pearl as a gift instead. Please excuse us for the little gift that doesn’t show our full sincerity.”</p>
<p>Despite saying this, he had a complacent demeanor. After all, this was an exceedingly rare divine pearl. It was not easy to come up with such a treasure.</p>
<p>The guests were marveling at this priceless gift.</p>
<p>“One Bloodshark Divine Pearl.” However, the old man receiving the presents had a relatively flat reaction and only recorded it on the list.</p>
<p>The Jian Clan was a wondrous existence with a deep foundation. The old man receiving presents had seen pretty much every kind of treasure. This was only one divine pearl, so of course his reaction was dull.</p>
<p>The gloating scion felt a bit lost after seeing the lack of reaction. He felt a bit of remorse as well because this pearl was still considered very precious for their village. But now, this old man from the Jian Clan was treating it like an ordinary piece of candy. This made him feel quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A disciple noticed that Li Qiye was standing by the door in a daze and quickly asked: “This is… Who might you be, Sir?”</p>
<p>“Heh, his name is Li Qiye from Peacock Land. Who knows if he was actually invited to the Jian Grandfather’s birthday or not?” The Bloodshark Scion was annoyed, so he used this opportunity to intentionally lower Li Qiye’s standing.</p>
<p>“So you are Young Noble Li from Peacock Land, I have heard of your great fame.” The Jian disciple was not a frog at the bottom of a well, so he immediately cupped his fists to greet Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at the scion who was trying to debase him and casually handed over the invitation given to him by Jian Xiaotie.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li, please come inside.” The disciple quickly led him to the main hall.</p>
<p>The scion who wanted to mock Li Qiye had to stop after seeing the invitation and could only snort instead.</p>
<p>After being taken to the reception area, Li Qiye didn’t say much and only handed a wooden box to the old man.</p>
<p>This box was very ordinary looking, as if it was a random and inconspicuous container for a regular birthday present.</p>
<p>“Oh? This is your present?” The Bloodshark Scion sneered and commented with disdain: “I heard your Peacock Land has no disciples other than a hoodlum like you, so I guess it is understandable for such a weak lineage. Don’t tell me you plucked a few leaves from the Peacock Tree and brought them here as a present for the Grandfather?”</p>
<p>“Brother Bloodshark, you shouldn’t be so demanding. After the calamity, Peacock Land has been stricken with poverty. One must remember that sincerity is more important than gifts. Just a few leaves are more than enough.” Shangguan Feilong smiled and added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>These two had grievances towards Li Qiye, so they held nothing back in their remarks.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored the two and told the old man in a flat tone: “A ginseng root, decent for longevity replenishment.”</p>
<p>The old man’s face changed as he immediately opened the wooden box. A rich and incomparable ginseng fragrance dispersed. As people smelled this scent, their blood energies suddenly erupted. The older cultivators felt like they were dozens of years younger.</p>
<p>A ginseng root was placed in this ordinary box. The entire section was as red as blood with a flowing purple glow, making it resemble a piece of jade. It seemed that this particular root had its own life.</p>
<p>The old man couldn’t help but exclaim in shock: “A Violet Blood Ginseng King! The root of an ancestor ginseng!” Despite his great experience, he was still shaken all the same. This was not something comparable to several million years old medicines. This was an immortal medicine!</p>
<p>Even just a small section had an unbelievable worth. For many cultivators, this little piece alone could prolong their life for a long time. Numerous older masters dreamed of such an item!</p>
<p>“An ancestor ginseng!” Some of the guests were astounded and quickly circled around to take a look.</p>
<p>“This is my first time seeing an immortal item like this.” A great power’s ancestor was shocked and had saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Immortal medicine, amazing. This is something that can only be obtained with great fortune, how many people have actually seen an immortal medicine in their lifetime?” Astonishment was the common reaction for these guests.</p>
<p>“This is an item exclusive to Godkings.” No one dared to have any ill thoughts about it since only Godkings could use an item of this level.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu and the other disciples from the lake were aghast at this inconceivable gift.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1253: Jian Clan</h4>
<p>Chapter 1253: Jian Clan</p>
<p>This ginseng root amazed the spectators. The violet glow on its red body made it look like a priceless treasure to just about anyone.</p>
<p>Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion were embarrassed by this root. Their expressions became quite ugly. They were laughing at Li Qiye earlier, but now, this ginseng root was a ruthless slap to their faces, leaving them with no room for retort.</p>
<p>Of course, this was not Li Qiye trying to show off. In terms of status, the Jian Grandfather was still his junior. Giving this root to prolong his life was only a greeting gift for a junior.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie hurried out at this time. He was talking to his guest inside the mansion, but as soon as he heard from a disciple, he ran outside right away. A ginseng root was still considered a grand gesture to their clan, so he had to personally greet Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, thank you for the generous gift.” He cupped his fists right away and said: “I thank you on behalf of our Grandfather.”</p>
<p>This root was quite crucial to the Grandfather since he was already eight thousand years old. It could prolong his life by at least one hundred years.</p>
<p>Li Qiye just nodded and lightly said: “Don’t mention it, just a small gift.”</p>
<p>This nonchalant attitude made some of the guests stare at the Bloodshark Scion and Shangguan Feilong. Earlier, the scion was gloating after presenting a Bloodshark Divine Pearl and mocked Li Qiye in the process. But now, Li Qiye’s ginseng root was countless times more precious than the pearl, yet Li Qiye still acted normally. The difference in the two’s worth became clear with a glance.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, Master Hong, and fellow daoists, please come inside.” Jian Xiaotie noticed that Li Qiye was together with Hong Tianzhu’s group, so he busily invited them in.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu and the disciples brightened up after being personally invited by Xiaotie, the successor of the Jian Clan. Even though he rarely showed himself, his status was great. Normally, he would only greet guests from imperial lineages or sea gods’ sects.</p>
<p>Thus, they felt respected after receiving this gesture from him.</p>
<p>As they were leaving, they walked by the Bloodshark Scion. Li Qiye only gave him a quick glance and stated: “This divine pearl is just a piece of crap. I would only use them to decorate the pen of livestock, it’s not worth a single coin.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye never took it easy on those who opposed him and left no room for conciliation. No one else dared to interfere with this personal grievance between the two.</p>
<p>The scion’s face reddened with anger after hearing this. He scowled and left right away. Feilong followed right after him. Staying any longer would only result in further humiliation.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie noticed the atmosphere and tried to change the topic: “Brother Li, this is your first time at our home. If you and everyone else don’t mind, how about a tour?”</p>
<p>Despite already being familiar with the mansion, Li Qiye still gently nodded: “A walk doesn’t sound bad.”</p>
<p>The mansion occupied a wide area. Inside it had its own heavenly grotto, so it was more accurate to call it an ancestral ground than a mansion.</p>
<p>There were temples and pavilions situated on majestic terrain everywhere. Rivers ran by with hills and other wondrous natural environments.</p>
<p>Dongting Lake’s disciples had an eye-opening experience while following Jian Xiaotie through the mansion. They thought that it was just a series of buildings in the beginning instead of it being its own separate space. Outside of shock, they truly realized that the Jian Clan wasn’t just powerful in name.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently sighed while walking through this familiar land with an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>All along, the Jian Clan wanted him to come back. To a certain extent, the clan was started by him. However, after burying Jian Wenxin, he didn’t want to come back here again because the same sentence kept echoing in his head whenever he returned.</p>
<p>“The heavens is too unreachable, there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” These were among her last words: “Your Excellency, I know your ambition is as high as the heavens and as far-reaching as the limits of the world. After I rest, I hope that you can go even further and faster. This is my end, the best I can hope for!”</p>
<p>He gently shook his head after recalling her words. In her last moments, he didn’t blame her or Empress Hong Tian.</p>
<p>The only pity was that Hong Tian had always been a stubborn girl. After so long, she still didn’t want to look back. However, it was precisely this unyielding stubbornness that carried her to such heights.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie, acting as a tour guide for everyone, noticed Li Qiye’s absent-mindedness and asked: “Brother Li, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s mind returned as he smiled: “Nothing, I’m just a bit tired. I will go back to rest.”</p>
<p>“Okay then.” Jian Xiaotie replied: “I have made the arrangements for your group’s living quarters. If you are tired, we can have this tour again tomorrow. That will be when Grandfather will come out as well. I’ll take you to see him then.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only chuckled in response. Meanwhile, the disciples from the lake enviously stared at Li Qiye. The Jian Grandfather was a Celestial Godking. Not just anyone could meet a character of this level in person. It was a kind of honor.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie led the group back to the guest rooms. However, they met other people on the way.</p>
<p>“My Queen, that’s Li Qiye.” At this time, Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion led two women here. Both of them could be considered kingdom-toppling and put girls like Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin to shame.</p>
<p>One of them was brilliantly charming while the other noble and enchanting. Their indescribable beauty could sway the soul. This was especially true for the noble woman in her phoenix dress. She exuded the mature vibe of a woman that was too temptatious.</p>
<p>Not only did they eclipse Hong Yujiao in beauty, their auras were powerful and imposing as well.</p>
<p>The charming girl had divine halos emanating from her body. Belying her slender figure that gave her a fragile appearance, the halos still engulfed this world with a frightening God-Monarch presence. She was the genius of the Roaring Conch, Shangguan Feiyan!</p>
<p>The other woman’s phoenix robe told the tale of her identity. She also had divine circles around her body with a spiritual mirror behind her head. This mirror could illuminate the entire world. It was irresistible and could steal away souls. This was the Profound God-Monarch’s favorite concubine, Gongsun Meiyu. She wasn’t a beautiful yet useless decorative vase since she was already famous as a genius before marrying the monarch in the Abyss Sea.</p>
<p>Her talents were superb since she cultivated the unique characteristics of the charming spirit to the highest level. Her bewitching eyes showed that she had mastered her seductive techniques. Rumor has it that her divine eyes could take control of others.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu was alarmed after seeing the two women because he had heard of the feud between them and Li Qiye. He knew that Li Qiye had killed Gongsun Meiyu’s favorite maid, Gongsun Qianer.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie frowned at this development as well. He was not one who was afraid of trouble, however Shangguan Feilong and the scion were stirring the pot, and this displeased him.</p>
<p>“You are the one who killed my maid?” Gongsun Meiyu’s eyes fell upon Li Qiye. Her phoenix eyes turned cold and stately.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was as calm as ever and only took a quick glimpse at Meiyu before replying in a flat tone: “Who?”</p>
<p>“Gongsun Qianer!” Meiyu coldly said: “The woman you killed at the Bottomless Trench!”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, something like that indeed happened.” Li Qiye smiled: “Unfortunately, she shouldn’t have made a move against me. I have never shown mercy to my enemies.”</p>
<p>“A life for a life!” Meiyu’s cold glare emitted a murderous intent: “I shall take your head and sacrifice it to her soul in the heavens.”</p>
<p>Feilong and the scion became quite excited to see Meiyu wishing to deal with Li Qiye. The two of them felt a sense of schadenfreude while waiting for her to kill him.</p>
<p>Li Qiye revealed a wide smile and raised his brows a little while looking at her. He then glanced at Feiyan and the other two before leisurely answering: “By yourself or everyone together? I think it is better if all of you come together so that I won’t have to waste too much time cleaning you up one by one.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1254: Quarrels</h4>
<p>Chapter 1254: Quarrels</p>
<p>Feiyan’s expression turned sour while the others hated Li Qiye even more. Meanwhile, Jian Xiaotie smiled wryly. Provoking Meiyu alone was problematic enough, but now he had offended Feiyan as well.</p>
<p>As for Hong Tianzhu’s group, they could only be described as speechless. Meiyu was backed by the Profound Dynasty while Feiyan came from the Roaring Conch. Both of these entities were untouchable.</p>
<p>But now, Li Qiye was antagonizing both of them. This was simply too crazy; it was as if he didn’t care about his enemies.</p>
<p>“Quite bold.” Feiyan’s pretty eyes turned cold. The halos around her body became even brighter as she stared at him: “I heard you are a tree controller. I want to see just how much you have learned from the Peacock Tree to allow you to act so bold and provoke me!”</p>
<p>“Only a God-Monarch, no big deal.” Li Qiye lazily answered: “I don’t want to stain the Jian Clan with blood today. Be smart and scram or I’ll chop you to pieces!”</p>
<p>These words were too direct and domineering. Jian Xiaotie felt his scalp tingling. This was adding oil to the fire!</p>
<p>“How confident, let me see it then!” Before Meiyu could erupt in anger, her eyes glared at him. In an instant, a murderous energy surged forth. Her halos suppressed the entire area, leaving others breathless.</p>
<p>“Ladies, ladies.” Jian Xiaotie quickly got between the two sides and blocked them from each other.</p>
<p>He cupped his fists to both Li Qiye and the two girls while smiling: “Brother Li, Miss Gongsun and Miss Shangguan, how about everyone just calm down today? Take one step back and everything will be better. Today is a joyous occasion, so please, spare us some face. Just smile and drop it.”</p>
<p>As an outsider, he didn't want to bother with their feud. However, this was before the Grandfather’s celebration and bloodshed was a very unlucky omen.</p>
<p>“Sister Shangguan, spare his dog life for now. Let him hold onto his head for a while longer. Wait until after the birthday celebration, it won’t be too late then.” Meiyu could endure this anger despite wanting revenge for her maid.</p>
<p>After all, fighting and killing at the birthday celebrations of the Jian Grandfather would be too disrespectful to the Jian Clan. Even though she was the monarch’s favorite, she still had a sense of propriety.</p>
<p>“You got lucky.” In the end, Feiyan still showed some consideration towards Jian Xiaotie. She peered back at Li Qiye and said: “If it wasn’t for Young Noble Jian pleading for you, this date next year would have been your funeral.”</p>
<p>“More like all of you are quite lucky. I do not wish to kill today, otherwise…” Li Qiye smiled gently, but his eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, this way please!” Jian Xiaotie was afraid that these three would quarrel and fight again, so he quickly led the way for Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t make it difficult for Jian Xiaotie. He just came back to the Jian Clan and didn’t want to kill. Otherwise, these girls wouldn’t have the chance to act like this in front of him. His usual disposition would have made him kill anyone who revealed a murderous intent against him!</p>
<p>The people from the lake heaved a sigh of relief. The confrontation between Li Qiye and the two women left them out of breath. A real fight would have been a very serious event.</p>
<p>“Master Hong, I heard you have some reservations about the marriage between our clans?” As Hong Tianzhu chased after Li Qiye, Feiyan called for him with a distant tone before he could make it very far.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu didn’t want any of this, but he still had to stop and cup his fists: “Miss Shangguan, it is not that I have a negative opinion of this marriage, it is just that this pertains to the most important event in the lives of the two children. We need careful deliberation before making a choice.”</p>
<p>“The elders from your lake have already agreed, my little brother is very happy as well, and my country is willing. Master Hong, what else is there to talk about?” Feiyan became quite imposing.</p>
<p>With that, she stared at Hong Yujiao and stated: “Is it because your daughter is unwilling? Does she think that my Wyvern Country is not a match for your Hong Clan?!”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure she doesn’t think that…” Hong Tianzhu coughed awkwardly. He didn’t want this marriage either since it was inviting wolves into their home! However, the ancestors had all agreed, so it was difficult for him to refuse.</p>
<p>“Little Sister Hong, do you not want such a wonderful thing?” Gongsun Meiyu chimed in at this time: “Young Noble Shangguan is a dragon among men. Wyvern is also a great power in the Dragon Demon Sea, and the two of you are quite a match. Your Hong bloodline can be considered a match for him, it will pass down excellent offspring for Wyvern…”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao was already quite annoyed with Feiyan’s aggressive tone, but she became even angrier because of Gongsun Meiyu’s interjection. The woman made it sound like this marriage was her trying to climb up the social ladder…</p>
<p>In fact, after seeing Feiyan’s presumptuous attitude, Hong Yujiao hated the idea of this marriage even more.</p>
<p>Her temper was not that mild, so she coldly responded to Feiyan: “Miss Shangguan, I will be in charge of my marriage.”</p>
<p>Feiyan continued to glare as she replied: “One’s marriage should be arranged by their elders. If the ancestors from the Hong Clan have decided, you just need to follow their arrangements…”</p>
<p>Li Qiye turned back and interrupted Feiyan: “If she doesn’t want this engagement, then scram already. Don’t use that shitty attitude to try and bully them! My Hong Clan is not something your Wyvern Country can reach up to!”</p>
<p>Her previously subsided anger immediately rose again. Feilong, on the other hand, couldn’t help but step forward and shouted as well: “Li, you are not part of the Hong Clan, so this has nothing to do with you. The business of the Hong is not for you to interfere with!”</p>
<p>Feiyan coldly glared at him and said: “Ignorant junior, I didn’t want to spill blood in this place, but you deserve a slapping with that comment.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye leisurely smiled in response: “You are right. I didn’t want to kill or spill blood here, but a slapping isn’t a bad idea!”</p>
<p>“Brother Li, Brother Li…” Jian Xiaotie quickly stopped him and nearly grabbed him in order to stop him from rushing forward to teach Feiyan a lesson.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, please give this little brother some face? Out of consideration for me, just calm down today and don't worry about any enmity. Everyone can deal with these grudges in several days, right?”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie’s bitter expression showed that he was on the verge of begging.</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at him before flatly speaking: “Tell them to stay the hell out of my sight. After today, there will be no more mercy!”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie was relieved. In fact, he didn’t know that Li Qiye was being quite considerate of him already. If it was any other time, he would have immediately began killing without a care after being provoked this much.</p>
<p>This was his first day of returning after a very long time. He didn’t wish to spill blood in the Jian Clan right away.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu sighed as well and quickly followed Li Qiye with his disciples.</p>
<p>“Master Hong.” Feiyan stated coldly after seeing that Tianzhu wanted to leave: “You should reconsider. Don’t let an outsider interfere with such an important matter. It won’t be good for Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>This remark was not only aggressive but also threatening. Hong Tianzhu naturally understood the implications and stiffened after hearing the words. Nevertheless, he didn’t respond and followed Li Qiye.</p>
<p>He felt very helpless in this matter. He had personally returned to the lake a couple of days ago in order to convince the ancestors, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t want to depend on others for this marriage, he felt an urge to trust Li Qiye this time. If no one could stop Feiyan, then this marriage would be a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao didn’t want to marry Feilong, but Tianzhu himself didn’t have the ability to change his daughter’s fate. Thus, he decided to gamble and latch onto this saving grace — Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Yujiao was quiet the entire way. She was in a daze and didn’t know what to do. She was certain that she didn’t want to marry Feilong. However, if the ancestors wouldn’t change their minds, then there was nothing else she could do.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, there’s no need to confront them so directly. Sometimes, the circuitous path is the right one.” As a human, Jian Xiaotie kindly reminded Li Qiye: “In the Dragon Demon Sea, humans are at a disadvantage. This is the world of sea demons; if you take the Roaring Conch head-on, I’m afraid you will lose sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and answered nonchalantly: “Xiaotie, I simply didn’t want to kill today over this kind of shit, but after tomorrow, I will kill anyone who continues to be blind, even if it is inside the Jian Mansion.”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie was without words after hearing this. He warned Li Qiye with good intentions, but Li Qiye simply didn’t take it to heart.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1255: Miss Lin</h4>
<p>Chapter 1255: Miss Lin</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie prepared the rooms for Li Qiye’s group. After taking care of everything, he finally bid goodbye.</p>
<p>The guy was very enthusiastic and thoughtful. This was not only because of Li Qiye’s valuable gift, but also because everyone was human, so he was even more attentive towards Li Qiye’s group.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu and the other disciples rode on Li Qiye’s coattails and enjoyed this superb treatment. This was a reception that was normally meant for imperial and sea god lineages.</p>
<p>If Hong Tianzhu’s group came alone, they wouldn’t have been subjected to this great hospitality.</p>
<p>Among the disciples, some were happy while others worried. The majority were mostly excited by just being able to enter the Jian Mansion. It would be even better if they could meet the clan’s disciples. After all, everyone was part of the human race, so there was an easy connection there. In this regard, the current generation of Dongting Lake was still relatively unstained from ambition and the lust for power, unlike the previous.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu, Hong Yujiao, and Miss Lin all had a sleepless night. The girls were worried about their marriages. Hong Yujiao simply didn’t want to marry Feilong at all. This was doubly true for Miss Lin. She didn’t know the Bloodshark Scion at all. Moreover, his reputation was quite bad. After the marriage, she would just become an incubator, used for her holy bloodline.</p>
<p>However, these two could only despair at their fate, unable to change it. At this time, they couldn’t help but think about Li Qiye!</p>
<p>He was only a stranger whom they knew nothing about except that he came from Peacock Land. Nevertheless, he still gave them a favorable impression, especially when he supported them in preventing their marriages, further fueling their hope. They inadvertently prayed that this stranger could change their fate.</p>
<p>Needless to say about Hong Tianzhu, his night was even longer. He didn’t only think about his daughter’s marriage, but also the fate of his disciples. More importantly, the future of the lake itself!</p>
<p>Even though he was the master of the lake, his own power was limited. The ancestors from the clans did as they pleased, so he couldn't coordinate the lake as a whole. It was simply impossible to make the lake stronger under such circumstances.</p>
<p>On top of it all, he was worried about his own future. These ancestors didn’t mind cooperating with outside races and even betrothing their most excellent bloodline to them. This was simply inviting wolves into their home!</p>
<p>The most at peace among them must have been Zhang Baitu. He was very content at this moment and didn’t desire much more. He simply wanted to continue to persevere on the path towards the dao. Because of this, he had the best sleep out of the group.</p>
<p>They woke up early the next day. Hong Tianzhu went to see the other guests here at the mansion and left the juniors behind.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao’s group didn’t know anyone here, so they went to find Li Qiye to see what he had in mind. However, he was nowhere to be found when they arrived at his little courtyard.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao asked: “Brother Zhang, where is Young Noble Li?”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu shook his head in response: “I don’t know either. He left very early in the morning and didn’t tell me where he was off to.”</p>
<p>The group was disappointed at his absence. The disciples looked at each other a bit before Hong Yujiao made a decision: “We’ll go out for a walk. It’ll be good to get acquainted with the Jian disciples.”</p>
<p>The rest nodded in agreement. This was still a good opportunity for them to get closer to the Jian disciples. It was a good thing for the lake as well.</p>
<p>“Brother Zhang, come with us.” Hong Yujiao didn’t leave him out despite him not being close to the rest of the disciples.</p>
<p>They left the small courtyard in order to take a walk around the Jian Mansion.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t get far before meeting Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion.</p>
<p>Feilong asked: “Little Sister, are you all going for a walk too?”</p>
<p>The scion’s eyes lit up like a hungry wolf after seeing Miss Lin. He smiled and said: “Brother Shuangguan and I are familiar with the Jian Clan, we should go together.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao didn’t want to go together with them, but she couldn’t refuse so directly.</p>
<p>Luckily, Jian Xiaotie came at the right time and the atmosphere settled down.</p>
<p>“Everyone is up so early, where is Brother Li?” Jian Xiaotie wanted to bring Li Qiye’s group to more places around the Jian Clan.</p>
<p>He had a strange affection for Li Qiye. Moreover, Li Qiye represented Peacock Land which meant that he would also stand for the human race in the future, so Jian Xiaotie was happy to befriend him.</p>
<p>“We don’t know.” Hong Yujiao’s group shook their heads as she replied: “Young Noble Li has left much earlier. We don’t know where he went.”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie said with a little disappointment: “Oh. The venerable ancestor came out today from his cultivation, so I wanted to introduce Brother Li to him.”</p>
<p>“My big sis and Queen Gongsun have gone to meet His Venerableness as well.” Feilong immediately added. He spoke with an elated expression. After all, few could see the Jian Grandfather, but his big sis was eligible to visit him.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie looked at Hong Yujiao’s group and suggested with a smile: “If everyone wants to take a walk, I’ll show you the way while we wait for Brother Li to come back before making other plans.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao was quite relieved to hear this. They were worried since they weren’t familiar with the mansion.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie personally led the way and acted as a good host. Feilong and the scion also shamelessly followed them with the intention of getting closer to Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only the two girls that disliked the duo, the other disciples from the lake felt the same way. However, they weren’t the host so they couldn’t do anything but let these two follow them.</p>
<p>Despite being the successor of the clan, Jian Xiaotie didn’t put on airs. He led the way while telling many interesting anecdotes from the clan, resulting in a lot of laughter.</p>
<p>At the same time, Feilong and the scion used this opportunity to get closer to the two girls. However, Hong Yujiao was polite yet distant towards Feilong while Miss Lin was trying to stay as far away as possible to the scion.</p>
<p>This annoyed the scion to no end. A sharp glint even flashed in his eyes. In his snobby mind, marrying him was Miss Lin’s blessing, but she was clearly hiding from him. He intended to teach her a lesson later on so that she would come to learn her own status!</p>
<p>Outside of certain forbidden locations, Xiaotie took the group to many different places. He was especially attentive towards the disciples from the lake.</p>
<p>They eventually passed by an ancient-styled courtyard. It had high walls so no one could see what was inside.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Jian, what is this place?” Zhang Baitu became curious at this fortress-like courtyard with its high walls.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie stopped and explained: “This is an old building in our clan that is normally closed and locked. I can’t enter either.”</p>
<p>He knew very little about this old courtyard, only that it dated back to the era of their progenitor. As for its purpose, he and the other disciples simply did not know.</p>
<p>Normally, this courtyard wouldn’t be open to outsiders. He, as the successor, had only entered a few times. Alas, he failed to see through the mysteries inside and assumed that it was only a regular building.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Jian, the door is open.” A lake disciple walking ahead cried out and curiously looked inside.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie was surprised to hear this and quickened his pace. Sure enough, the normally shut wooden door was actually open.</p>
<p>“Who opened it?” Jian Xiaotie was caught off guard and immediately went inside.</p>
<p>The disciples from the lake were curious and followed him.</p>
<p>This courtyard was not large. There was a lot of green bamboo here with their shadows swaying around. When the wind blew by, the leaves would flutter. This was a very elegant place, great for contemplation.</p>
<p>In the center of the courtyard was a stone table with chairs surrounding it, and on the table was a chess board. A statue was situated on one side while a person sat opposite to it. [1. It is Chinese chess, xiangqi.]</p>
<p>“Brother Li, why are you here?” Jian Xiaotie was surprised to see the person seated in the chair.</p>
<p>It was Li Qiye; he sat there quietly as if he didn’t hear the question. The rest of the group saw him and didn’t think that he would be here after leaving so early in the morning.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1256: Torn Body And Crushed Bones</h4>
<p>Chapter 1256: Torn Body And Crushed Bones</p>
<p>Li Qiye seemed to be in a trance as he didn’t answer anyone.</p>
<p>This chess match was very messy. No one could see what kind of chess game this was because the pieces were placed outrageously, as if a little child had randomly put them there.</p>
<p>The statue sitting on the other side seemed to be a woman, judging by its appearance. However, the style in which it was carved was very vague, so people couldn’t discern her features.</p>
<p>However, upon a closer inspection of its contours, it was clear that it wasn’t the creator who chose to sculpt in this vague manner, it was because the woman didn’t want the world to see her true appearance. It was hidden like Mount Lushan amidst the clouds.</p>
<p>Li Qiye remained there motionlessly, as if he had turned into stone as well.</p>
<p>“Brother Li, how did you get in?” Jian Xiaotie took a look around and found that no one else was here. He became quite puzzled because if the people in the clan didn’t open it, outsiders shouldn’t have been able to enter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Li Qiye continued to sit there, frozen. Who knows if he was enchanted by the chess match or something else. All in all, he seemed to be shut off from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>No one expected Li Qiye to be playing chess against a statue after leaving so early in the morning. They took a look at the messy board and didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>Miss Lin, who had a very favorable impression of him, bent down and whispered with a gentle demeanor: “Young Noble, are you okay?”</p>
<p>There was still no reply from the seemingly petrified Li Qiye.</p>
<p>The scion became jealous after seeing her gentle demeanor towards Li Qiye. His eyes turned cold as he sneered: “Hmph, it’s only a statue and a dumb game, what’s the point of acting all mysterious? Does he really think he’s all that, using this board to comprehend the grand dao of the nine heavens? Hmph, he’s just dressing up as god and playing the devil to act cool.”</p>
<p>Miss Lin, who already hated him, became even more unhappy. She frowned in response: “Young Noble Li is deep in focus right now, who says he is pretending?”</p>
<p>“Hah, deep in focus?” The scion became even more jealous after hearing Miss Lin speak out for Li Qiye. He smirked and said with disdain: “That’s only a broken statue. Does he need to contemplate so hard against a statue? Only a fool would need to do so. Perhaps this statue was picked up from a rubbish heap, heh, a work without any craftsmanship or art, a piece of garbage that only a fool would take seriously.”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie’s expression soured after hearing this, but he was a cultured person and didn’t show his hostility in public.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the scion was blinded by his own jealousy and didn’t think too much or notice the look on Jian Xiaotie’s face.</p>
<p>Feilong also shook his head and laughed: “Scion, you shouldn’t laugh at the guy. People can be a little bit eccentric. Staring at a statue in a daze, this is nothing, only a type of mental disorder. I heard some miracle doctors can cure this illness in the Dragon Demon Sea.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ruined his business with Hong Yujiao time and time again, so Feilong wanted to kill him. Because of this, he naturally seized this opportunity to ridicule him.</p>
<p>“Mental disorder?” The scion sneered: “This is far worse than a mental disorder. It is an abnormal and perverted taste. Only an extremely wretched scoundrel would have fantasies towards such an ugly statue, only a monster would be interested in this stone abomination!”</p>
<p>The scion had lost his rational restraints and didn’t realize that his words were offending other people. Jian Xiaotie’s expression was becoming worse and worse. Prior to this, he was indifferent towards Feilong’s taunting of Li Qiye. After all, that was their personal feud.</p>
<p>But now, the scion not only insulted Li Qiye, but also the statue. This was a great symbol in their clan, so how could Jian Xiaotie not become mad?</p>
<p>At this time, Li Qiye suddenly stood up and went outside.</p>
<p>“Oh? Did I touch a nerve? Are you too ashamed now and want to run away?” The scion guffawed and felt the joy of victory after seeing Li Qiye leaving without a word.</p>
<p>Feilong echoed cheerfully as well: “Looks like he is at least aware of his lowliness. Scion, you exposing his fetish left him no face to stay here any longer.”</p>
<p>“Roll out here and accept your death lest your lowly blood stain the serenity of this place.” Li Qiye coldly uttered from outside of the ancient courtyard.</p>
<p>The initially angry scion became even more furious. He snorted in response: “Li, you think I’m afraid of you? The person who is about to die has yet to be determined!” With that, he rushed outside as well.</p>
<p>“That’s right, don’t think you can run rampant just because you are a treefather’s disciple.” Feilong snorted and darted outside.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was emotionless. This time around, the host, Jian Xiaotie, didn’t bother interfering. He stood there with both arms crossed in front of his chest and indifferently watched events unfold.</p>
<p>He was angry this time. It was already quite polite of him to not attack the scion for insulting his ancestor, let alone stopping the fight.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave him a chilling glare before leisurely asking: “How do the two of you want to die?”</p>
<p>“So confident!” Feilong sneered and coldly responded: “Li Qiye, do you really think we are fish on the chopping block? The only reason I have yet to kill you is because Queen Gongsun has already claimed your dog life. But if you provoke me, I’ll still kill you all the same!”</p>
<p>“Less blabbering, come together, I will give you two the first strike.” Li Qiye was unusually cold. Those who knew him would find this whole scene very surprising and become frightened.</p>
<p>They knew that when he had such a cold appearance, his bloodthirst would be roused. At such a juncture, he would start killing without mercy no matter who the opponent might be.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Qiye viewed these two as ants, so he could turn a deaf ear to their jeering. Unfortunately, they were fatally naive and insulted the statue. After uttering those words, their fates were sealed. No one would be able to save them from certain demise.</p>
<p>“How arrogant!” The scion crazily laughed before stating: “Li, who the hell do you think you are? Do you really think that having a treefather for a master is that great? My ancestor was an invincible sea god! Your background is nothing in comparison!”</p>
<p>The Bloodshark Sovereign from their village had been recognized by the Trident, but it eventually abandoned him so he failed to become a full-fledged sea god.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the village still took pride in him being accepted by the Trident and claimed that their ancestor was a sea god!</p>
<p>Li Qiye coldly declared without batting an eye: “Go, I shall kill the both of you with one move.”</p>
<p>Feilong angrily replied: “Very well, Li Qiye. The scion and I will test your skill.”</p>
<p>The scion took out a crimson blade with a bloody mist billowing around it. He licked his lips while his eyes revealed a bloodthirsty glint before speaking: “Little animal, my blade has not tasted blood in a long time, I’ll let it have its fill today.”</p>
<p>Miss Lin turned pale from shock and kindly reminded Li Qiye: “Young Noble, be careful of his blade.”</p>
<p>Her demeanor only further ignited the scion’s fury. He furiously screamed: “Little animal, die!”</p>
<p>With that, his body turned into a bloody ray as he came slashing towards Li Qiye.</p>
<p>A bang was followed by a snap, and then the harsh sound of bones cracking.</p>
<p>Everyone saw Li Qiye fling the scion straight to the ground with one hand. The ground cracked along with the scion’s flesh. Li Qiye then grabbed him by the leg and continued to smash him mercilessly, causing his blood to splash everywhere.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was too fast and no one could even see how the scion fell into his hands. They only saw the smashing; fleshy bits began to fly alongside the blood.</p>
<p>At this time, these broken bits of meat were still bouncing on the ground, drenched in warm blood.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1257: Cemetery</h4>
<p>Chapter 1257: Cemetery</p>
<p>This scene of carnage was simply too shocking. Hong Yujiao and the disciples from the lake all felt the urge to puke.</p>
<p>They had heard of the phrase “torn body and crushed bones.” However, they had never actually witnessed bones breaking into powder until today. This was truly the embodiment of “torn body and crushed bones.”</p>
<p>They quivered after seeing this bloody display, only Jian Xiaotie stood there coolly. This was within his expectations.</p>
<p>Li Qiye lifted his head and coldly stared at Shangguan Feilong without taking action just yet.</p>
<p>Feilong’s legs were trembling. He wasn’t that much stronger than the scion. No, the scion was actually stronger than him, and yet he was annihilated in just one move. This result left him pissing his pants in horror.</p>
<p>“You… you... don’t come over here! Don’t come over here!” After seeing Li Qiye inching closer, he stumbled several steps back with a pale countenance. He was truly scared out of his mind this time.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye continued to take one step after another while glaring at him.</p>
<p>“You… don’t do anything foolish!” Feilong kept on stumbling backward while shouting: “I, I am the crown prince of Wyvern, my sister is the mistress of the Roaring Conch while my brother-in-law is the Seashield Prince. If, if you dare to touch a hair of mine, my, my sister will not spare you! My Wyvern will root out your nine clans!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued his stride without replying.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Jian, hurry and save me!” After noticing that Li Qiye had no intention of stopping, Feilong had to shout at Jian Xiaotie to try to grab onto him as a life-saving straw.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie wanted to say something, but after seeing Li Qiye’s cold expression and determined steps, he knew that it would be a futile endeavor.</p>
<p>“Brother Shangguan, this is your personal feud, I’m afraid it is not my place to intervene.” Jian Xiaotie realized that those who try to stop Li Qiye would only be seeking their own destruction. He didn’t want to be someone else’s cannon fodder.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop!” Feilong screamed louder as Li Qiye approached: “I, I won’t marry Hong Yujiao then! You can have her, okay?!”</p>
<p>In the face of death, Feilong desperately said everything he could; he would do anything just to survive.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao immediately looked at him with disdain after hearing this. The disciples of the lake gave him the same glance.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stopped and coldly told Feilong: “I will give you a chance to attack.”</p>
<p>Feilong swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said: “If, if you stand still, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>“Very well, I will give you a chance and stand still.” Li Qiye flatly replied while looking at the weak-legged Feilong.</p>
<p>Feilong went on: “You, you must keep your word and not move at all or, or else I’ll be the winner.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye indifferently said: “Quickly, I won’t move…”</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye couldn’t even finish his sentence before Feilong began to desperately run away with all of his strength. At this moment, he wished his mother had given him two more legs to allow him to flee even faster.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but shake his head disapprovingly after seeing the frantic escape. His eyes turned cold with a flash that shot out as fast as a divine arrow.</p>
<p>“No…” Right when the next enclosure was within his sight, Feilong suddenly felt a jolt of pain and had to scream. Next, his corpse fell to the ground with a loud thump.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nonchalantly murmured after killing Feilong with his glare: “Daring to cultivate with such a dao heart.”</p>
<p>Even the lake’s disciples looked down on him at this moment. Even though the Bloodshark Scion was loathful, at least he was still a fierce character. Feilong gave up his own marriage and showed that he would hand over his fiancee to someone else just to survive.</p>
<p>After disposing of the two, Li Qiye acted as if nothing had happened. He ordered Xiaotie before entering the old courtyard again: “Xiaotie, I’ll leave them to you.”</p>
<p>“Squeak.” After his entry, the wooden doors to the courtyard suddenly shut tight.</p>
<p>Xiaotie wanted to speak, but Li Qiye had already locked himself inside. In the end, he could only sigh.</p>
<p>A disciple from the lake said with admiration: “Young Noble Li is so powerful.”</p>
<p>Another one added: “He is the disciple of an ancestral tree, how could he not be powerful?”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao watched as his shadow disappeared into the courtyard and lamented with a sigh as well. This person was a dragon shrouded in clouds and mists; no one could truly see through him.</p>
<p>Miss Lin was temporarily frozen while recalling Li Qiye’s invincible demeanor and style when he stood up for her. A long time passed before she calmed down as her face inadvertently blushed.</p>
<p>After going inside, Li Qiye sat down before the chess board again to look at the statue in a daze. After a while, he lamented: “The burden I feel whenever I come here has kept me from coming back for all this time, but I have to leave in this generation so let me see you one more time.”</p>
<p>With that, he raised a chess piece and placed it down on the board again. The whole scheme of the board suddenly changed; the movement of one piece could stabilize the universe.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The atmosphere of the board resembled an ocean of stars. It was vast and endless as it slowly swirled like a vortex.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stepped inside this starry vortex and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>When he regained his sight, he found himself in a place with beautiful mountains and rivers. In this place was the warm sunlight accompanied by a pleasant spring breeze. The sunlight was very gentle like the sweet embrace of a woman.</p>
<p>There was a small hillside. The entire hill was spread like a palm to hug someone. It was covered with grassy plains, and one would smell a comfortable fragrance if they were to rest here.</p>
<p>Two rows of treasure bamboos were planted to the left and right sides of this hill. These extremely precious trees exuded purple glows; each one was priceless.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was an old well on one side that emitted an ethereal mist. A purple hue could be found within, and the plumes of this mist continued to emanate throughout the entire hill. This well that was engulfed in a purple mist resembled an immortal land while its wondrous brilliance made it seem as if there was an incredible item buried at the bottom.</p>
<p>Upon a careful inspection, one would find a tablet within the mist-filled land. It had the appearance of an antique, indicating that it was made from the legendary Celestial Violet Stone.</p>
<p>It was truly extravagant to carve a tombstone out of this celestial stone. Fewer than few people in this world were able to enjoy such treatment. Not even a Godking was eligible for this grand gesture.</p>
<p>In Memory of Jian Wenxin — this was written on the tablet. Just these five words alone could last for an eternity. The withering of time failed to erode it.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was petrified while standing before the tablet. He eventually lied down on the grass in front of it.</p>
<p>He slowly closed his eyes as if he wanted to sleep here. Everything became incredibly quiet and peaceful — a state of gentle repose.</p>
<p>After a long time, he opened his eyes to look at the well as he spoke with a faint smile: “You know, when I took the dragonwell in order to bring a spirit vein to this place, the geezer from the Giant Dragon Mountain was very unhappy. After so many years, that old man is still so stingy. His greedy nature probably won’t ever change.”</p>
<p>The world remained silent. No one could talk or respond in this serenity.</p>
<p>“So much time has passed that I have let go of what should be let go of. I have made peace with the past.” Li Qiye looked at the blue sky and chuckled: “But that girl, Hong Tian, will not let it go. She won’t admit her mistake back then and refuses to stand down. Alas, being right or wrong doesn’t matter to me since I have lived for so long. Both of you did what you did for my sake.”</p>
<p>The world remained still; no response could be found.</p>
<p>“Among the winding distant years, not too many people have understood me and know of my desire.” Li Qiye heaved a sentimental sigh and continued: “It is a pity that you wanted an ordinary life.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps your endless wisdom allowed you to see through the prosperity of this world. In your eyes, a mundane life was the most precious thing. After experiencing the pains in life, you wanted to pursue an ordinary happiness and hoped to have a warm home.”</p>
<p>“Alas, I am destined to go on a long journey and you couldn’t hold me back. Of course, I didn’t force you to follow me into endless wars, an endless cycle of murder!” Li Qiye sighed softly.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1258: Past Feelings</h4>
<p>Chapter 1258: Past Feelings</p>
<p>One grave and one person in a hushed world. The wind was gently blowing like a gentle hand caressing every inch of the flesh. A warm sensation accompanied its coolness, inducing a drowsy desire.</p>
<p>Li Qiye lied there and whispered intimately. No one knows if he was simply expressing himself or letting go of all burdens.</p>
<p>“The reason I didn’t want to go back was not because I couldn’t forget the past. That’s all it is, the past.” Li Qiye said with a trace of helplessness: “Whenever I come to Rainbow City, I can’t help but recall your unforgettable words.”</p>
<p>A prolonged silence ensued as Li Qiye became quite sentimental. He eventually lifted his head to look at the tombstone: “I came back in order to say goodbye. My journey this time will be full of the unknown.”</p>
<p>“In the nine heavens and ten earths, I’m not afraid of the godfiends, emperors, or deities, not even the geezers from the Qian Clan. Sooner or later, I will trample on them all. I will massacre all those who try to stop me and even annihilate their clans completely!” Li Qiye claimed while looking at the horizon.</p>
<p>However, his mood soured once more: “The only uncertainty is the great war at the end of the world. No one knows what will come of this world. Perhaps my era will be everlasting… or it will be utterly destroyed. But someone needs to take this final step. I won’t stop no matter what the final outcome might be. No, I can’t be stopped and I won’t make compromises either!”</p>
<p>“You told me that the heavens is too unreachable and that there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” He mournfully said: “But I will not be an ant! I can’t handle being an ant! Whether it be the Immortal Demon Grotto or the end of the world, I will continue even if the path is endless!</p>
<p>“Just like back then when you asked me if I wanted to stay. My answer will always be ‘never’!” His eyes became determined: “In years past, some have broken my bones, some have exposed me to all kinds of suffering, some completely sealed my world and some mocked and reviled me…</p>
<p>"Then there were the many who loved me, whom I loved, and those who were loyal to me… They slowly disappeared in the river of time… But whether it’s my enemies, friends, or even lovers, none of them can stop me from reaching the end! I will either become eternal or mere ashes! These are the only two possible outcomes for me.</p>
<p>“When you asked why I didn’t indulge myself and became a happy and satisfied mortal, this is my answer. I refuse to compromise with anyone!” He became silent after stating this.</p>
<p>“This might be our final farewell. As for Hong Tian, it will be up to her. I don’t blame her, but if she blames me, I can’t do anything about it. Farewell, Wenxin, the one who understood me and my ambition the most.” Eventually, he gave the tombstone a deep look before leaving without turning back.</p>
<p>Jian Wenxin was an indelible name that would forever stay in his heart.</p>
<p>In that distant yet brilliant era, Empress Hong Tian had yet to ascend to her throne. There existed many apex geniuses and incredible characters. Three particular girls reigned supreme for the whole of this era; many men were completely overshadowed by them.</p>
<p>There was a widespread phrase during that period to describe the three ladies: Hong Tian — the Ill-starred Conqueror, Jian Wenxin — the Ocean’s Wisdom, Mu Yueli — the Immortal’s Legacy. [1. These are four-word phrases being used as adjectives, essentially secondary titles for the three. Hong Tian is considered to be unlucky or ill-fated with a bad constitution, so that’s her name. Ocean’s Wisdom used to be “as wise as the ocean”, but I like Ocean’s Wisdom more. Immortal’s Legacy used to be “as great as an immortal”, but it is what it is for the same reason above. The real meanings behind “legacy” are: 1/ physical beauty 2/ natural temperament/style/aura 3/ natural talents/constitution 4/ natural characters/morals. It’s hard to find a descriptor here that fits all of that, so legacy it is.]</p>
<p>Empress Hong Tian was not particularly excellent in terms of innate talents, but her ambition had no bounds. Because of this, many people mocked her for having “a will higher than the heavens and a fate thinner than paper” when she made her dao debut.</p>
<p>As the Dark Crow, on the day when he met this girl with that determined look in her eyes, the first thing he taught her was not a profound merit law but one sentence that would forever stay with her — can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan?!</p>
<p>This phrase stuck with the little miss for her whole life. From then on, her name changed to Hong Tian, a name that would illuminate the eons and deter both gods and devils!</p>
<p>Her will was higher than the heavens, but her fate was thinner than paper. It was definitely not easy for her during that brilliant era since her ordinary talents couldn’t reach the apex compared to the other geniuses.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even before such foes, she was determined to reign above the nine heavens! Such an unrealistic dream caused her to be ridiculed by countless people and made her suffer many painful hardships.</p>
<p>During those long years, she failed and cried. Tears and blood were spilled, but she persevered onward and made it very far with a crow as her companion.</p>
<p>Her life had no lack of failures. She had lost more than just once to the hands of Jian Wenxin.</p>
<p>This was a woman full of wisdom who had deep ties with the Dark Crow since youth. After her debut, she aimed for the Heaven’s Will and became one of the strongest rivals of Immortal Emperor Hong Tian.</p>
<p>With her great wisdom, she was able to scheme and strategize, much to the chagrin of the empress.</p>
<p>However, despite being so gifted at birth, she chose mundanity at the end of her path. Her experiences made her give up on the Heaven’s Will as she chose to stay with the Dark Crow and plot for him from behind the curtains.</p>
<p>It could be said that the empress’ unstoppable conquest, to a large extent, was to Jian Winxen’s credit from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Born to be extraordinary yet choosing to be ordinary. She wanted to stay in this world and live the rest of her life as a mortal. Alas, she was still exceptional due to her boundless wisdom. After becoming an empress, Hong Tian consulted Jian Wenxin about a certain matter.</p>
<p>At that time, they shared the same belief. Jian Wenxin came up with a perfect plan while the empress carried it out. Because of this, the Dark Crow and the empress had a falling out.</p>
<p>For the empress, there was nothing more important than the Dark Crow. In this world, he was the only one who was there for her when she smiled and cried. No matter how difficult it was, his shadow would always be beside her!</p>
<p>The always-stubborn empress was never obstinate before him, but not this time. The two had a great quarrel and from then on they parted ways and continued on their individual paths.</p>
<p>Jian Wenxin had augured the mysteries of the heaven and earth and spied into its secrets in order to concoct the plan. Because of this, she wasted too much energy and arrived at her deathbed. Even with this turn of events, she wanted to have a peaceful end with the Dark Crow next to her.</p>
<p>After her departure from this world, Li Qiye buried her in this incredibly beautiful place. He then left to a faraway place and began his slumber.</p>
<p>From then on, he never stepped foot into the Jian Clan again. It was not because he blamed her for that particular event, but because he always remembered that one phrase from her.</p>
<p>It was because she knew him and his thoughts the best that it was difficult for him to forget those words. He finally returned in this generation and visited her grave because it might be their final farewell.</p>
<p>He sighed after leaving the cemetery. However, he also felt relieved for finally returning after so long. At last, he was able to say goodbye one last time.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie, who was standing guard outside of the old courtyard, immediately stood up after seeing Li Qiye coming out. He didn’t dare to believe his eyes and had no words to describe his feelings.</p>
<p>This was because he had heard of a legend in their clan. He didn’t know whether it was real or not, but he felt that he was seeing a ghost instead of Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and asked: “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie was startled and quickly regained his mind to say: “Brother Li, there is a problem. Miss Hong and Daoist Zhang have been captured by Shangguan Feiyan.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you to take good care of them?” Li Qiye frowned in response.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie wryly smiled and explained: “Brother Li, Feiyan was crazy as she searched for you. Since she couldn’t find you, she captured Miss Hong and Daoist Zhang instead. I could only do my best and stopped her from hurting them in the slightest.”</p>
<p>“She said that as long as you go meet her, she will let them go.” Jian Xiaotie was a bit ashamed as he continued on: “I have consulted the ancestors about this. If Feiyan doesn’t release them, they will force her to do so.”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1259: Gathering Of Heroes</h4>
<p>Chapter 1259: Gathering Of Heroes</p>
<p>So it turned out that after Li Qiye killed Shangguan Feilong, his sister became furious and wanted to kill Li Qiye as an offering for her brother.</p>
<p>After she came running, Li Qiye could no longer be found, so she directed her anger towards the disciples from the lake instead. Luckily, Jian Xiaotie was there to stop her.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she didn’t concede and took away Baitu and Yujiao while declaring that Li Qiye had to come and accept his death. Otherwise, she would kill these two instead.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold as he flatly said: “When it is time for blood to flow, there is no stopping it. If those girls wish to die, I’ll gladly help them.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
<p>Though those words were casually spoken, the cold flash in his eyes left Jian Xiaotie quivering. He felt that he was looking at a death god that was about to kill.</p>
<p>A garden in the Jian Clan was being used to entertain the respected guests. At this time, there were many people here, including some of the most exceptional talents of the younger generation. There were a few experts from the previous generations as well. Some of them were even Virtuous Paragons.</p>
<p>Shangguan Feiyan and Gongsun Meiyu definitely stood out in this place; they were moons surrounded by stars.</p>
<p>Shangguan Feiyan was only second to the Seashield Prince among the geniuses at the Roaring Conch. Gongsun Meiyu was extremely famous as well, and her fame only rose after marrying the Profound Monarch.</p>
<p>At this feast, the elegant and enchanting Meiyu had an irresistible style. Each of her smiles and grimaces was able to sway souls. Nevertheless, no one dared to have any devious thoughts. It was suicidal to compete for the Profound Monarch's woman.</p>
<p>As for Feiyan, she stood here in an arrogant and chilling manner. Naturally, her mood was quite foul after her brother was killed.</p>
<p>This was an occasion meant for the youths. They happily came together to talk about all kinds of events in the world.</p>
<p>“My Queen, I heard the monarch has come out of his isolated cultivation. When will we be graced with his presence?” Someone couldn’t help but bring up the monarch.</p>
<p>Many youths and even characters from the previous generation became excited after hearing this name. They all directed their attention towards Meiyu.</p>
<p>The Profound Monarch's fame was not empty. His title was slightly approved of by the older God-Monarchs as well.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake if someone were to think that he was old. In fact, he was not that much older than Gongsun Meiyu. His talents and constitution could easily be imagined due to his early accomplishments.</p>
<p>He came from the Profound Sea Dynasty, one of the four branches of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.</p>
<p>This was the first emperor in this world, and his four branches were formed during the Desolate Era. From this, one could see how old and strong these branches were among the charming spirits.</p>
<p>They had produced three Immortal Emperors and one grand completion Immortal Physique. This allowed them to have an unshakable status in Heaven Spirit.</p>
<p>The monarch had been extremely gifted since his youth. After becoming a monarch, he came into control of the Profound Dynasty.</p>
<p>After hearing the question, the charming-to-the-bones Meiyu chuckled. This slight smile made others tremble uncontrollably.</p>
<p>She answered: “The monarch has returned to the origin. He is opening up his territory to create a kingdom in order to receive the tributes of his people.”</p>
<p>Everyone here quivered after hearing this. The youths were full of envy and admiration. To become a True Monarch at such a young age was incredibly awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>There were five levels to God-Monarchs. In the mind of the older generation, only those at the True Monarch level and above were considered God-Monarchs.</p>
<p>For example, Feiyan was an Intermediate Monarch. However, in the eyes of the strong, she was not much at all; she was still a bit lacking before she deserved the title of God-Monarch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was a great gap between an Intermediate Monarch and a True Monarch. After reaching the true level, this monarch would have their own citizens and be able to receive tributes from them that would strengthen their blood energy.</p>
<p>Thus, these monarchs had an innate advantage that Intermediate Monarchs couldn’t make up for. Right now, the Profound Monarch had opened up his kingdom to receive power from this new source.</p>
<p>“What a pity.” An older paragon gently sighed: “If the monarch chose the path of the heavens, he could probably have become an Immortal Emperor to become a ruler alongside the Seashield Prince.”</p>
<p>Many people gently nodded in agreement. Only Meiyu smiled and proudly declared: “Even if the monarch can't become an Immortal Emperor, he will definitely become something quite close to one.”</p>
<p>No one would refute this claim because they believed the Profound Monarch was worthy of this high evaluation.</p>
<p>“That’s right, the charming spirits have the Profound Monarch and the sea demons have the Seashield Prince. Who else can compare to them in the contemporary?” A cultivator wanted to please Meiyu with flattery.</p>
<p>An old paragon nodded and praised: “Yes. The Seashield Prince has pretty much received the recognition of the Trident. After doing so, he will be able to reach the peak and become a sea god. From then on, he won't need to fear even an Immortal Emperor any longer.”</p>
<p>Many people grew excited when they heard this, especially the sea demons. Their blood began to surge after the Trident was brought up. This was an inevitable reaction for those of their race.</p>
<p>It was the ultimate artifact of their race and completely invincible in this world. It was even better than an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, so it became the sea demons’ pride. In their eyes, even if they couldn’t shoulder the Heaven’s Will, they could still fight an Immortal Emperor as long as the wielder could handle the Trident.</p>
<p>A demon sect master commented emotionally: “Ever since the Lithodidae Sea God, the Trident has not appeared. Its appearance this time will herald a new supreme.” [1. Okay, Lithodidae is just King Crab. I mused through it and looked for another name, but Lithodidae seems close enough. King Crab Sea God is just too strange even though I usually refrain from using modern taxonomy for names.]</p>
<p>The Lithodidae Sea God was the previous sea god of their race. In the past, the trident had actually recognized the Bloodshark Sovereign. However, for some unknown reason, it abandoned him and chose the Lithodidae Sea God instead.</p>
<p>“In this era, we have two candidates who qualify — the Seven Seas Martial Goddess and the Seashield Prince.” A sea demon here immediately commented without thinking.</p>
<p>His friend immediately elbowed him and told him to be more careful with his words. This sea demon finally noticed that Feiyan was here and smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>The Roaring Conch was one of the strongest sea demon lineages in this region. They had produced two sea gods in the past. However, there was another behemoth around — the Seven Martial Pavilion. It was even stronger since it had given rise to three sea gods before!</p>
<p>The Seashield Prince was considered the strongest prodigy among the sea demons, but the Seven Seas Goddess was just as excellent. There was even a rumor stating that she had learned all seven grand styles from the pavilion!</p>
<p>Meiyu only smiled after hearing this: “The prince is a supreme genius, I’m sure he will become the next sea god.”</p>
<p>Feiyan also coldly responded: “My senior brother can compete with any other genius in this generation. The trident shall be his alone no matter who the other competitors might be.”</p>
<p>Feiyan’s cold expression slightly melted after talking about her brother.</p>
<p>People were taken aback after hearing her evaluation. After all, she was still a monarch, yet she held him in such high regard. This was indicative of his strength.</p>
<p>In fact, some had heard that Feiyan gave up on the path of the heavens because she knew she was not as strong as her brother. Because of this, she trod the path of the grand era instead.</p>
<p>The normally aloof girl couldn’t help but comment more on her senior brother: “He will not only become a sea god but also a user of a grand completion Immortal Physique. Others will only be wasting time trying to compete against him for the Trident.”</p>
<p>Her demeanor unavoidably became one of yearning and adoration.</p>
<p>Another sea demon flattered: “The prince’s Void Physique has been famous for a long time now. Even if the Seven Seas Goddess knows all seven styles of the pavilion, she still might not be able to contend against him.”</p>
<p>Despite the glorified praise, many people exchanged glances filled with respect. This was because the Seashield Prince was rumored to have a half-completion Immortal Physique. Feiyan’s statement today only made these rumors even more credible.</p>
<p>“We have many talents in the Heaven Spirit World right now. Even though no one has come out among the treants, just our Profound Monarch and Seashield Prince are enough to not be afraid of any other genius in the nine worlds when they become connected again.” A young cultivator laughed after stating this.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This will be the era of our charming spirits and sea demons. As for the human race… they aren’t worth mentioning.” Another echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p>“I heard that a human named Li Qiye has come out recently. He is quite strong as well.” A reckless boy couldn’t help but comment.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1260: Divine Reflection Seductive Gaze</h4>
<p>Chapter 1260: Divine Reflection Seductive Gaze</p>
<p>Many people were astounded after hearing this reckless kid. Everyone knew about the enmity between Li Qiye and Gongsun Meiyu since he killed her maid. And recently, he killed Feiyan’s little brother as well.</p>
<p>Someone next to him gently gave him a nudge. However, this kid was too honest and continued on without realizing the situation: “Why are you pushing me? I’m just telling the truth. Rumor has it that back at the Jade Sea, Li Qiye refined billions of Teeming Fish, something that no one in history has ever dared to do before. The treants in that region are saying that he is as ferocious as a butcher. Everyone is afraid of him there.”</p>
<p>The people standing next to him felt helpless and wanted to make some distance between him and them. They looked away as if to say that they didn’t know this crazy fella.</p>
<p>Feiyan, who was sitting there coldly, scowled after hearing this, but she didn’t act up.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many still noticed her displeasure and immediately spoke: “I have heard about the blood sacrifice as well, but that’s only a rumor. The real mastermind was the Peacock Tree, Li Qiye was only an errand boy carrying out instructions.”</p>
<p>“But it was still refining an entire army of Teeming Fish.” The young boy was unrelenting: “He still dared to stand before so many of them, this speaks volume of his great courage. If it was me, I would have pissed my pants already.”</p>
<p>“Courage at times is only blind ignorance and arrogance.” Feiyan coldly stated: “Cultivators rely on power, ignorance will only lead to death.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, no more from you.” The senior of the reckless boy noticed Feiyan becoming angry and quickly slapped him.</p>
<p>The youth felt wronged after being scolded by his senior, but he couldn’t do anything besides silently smolder with indignation.</p>
<p>“Haha, he’s only a human, nothing much. The Heaven Spirit World belongs to us sea demons and charming spirits. A human alone can’t create any winds or waves.” This senior laughed in order to smooth things out.</p>
<p>Gongsun Meiyu snickered and said: “He’s just a junior, that’s all. There is nothing to talk about. He has been presumptuous for too long and has now provoked me, so it is time for him to die!”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course.” Someone immediately echoed the sentiment: “A human is nothing in our Heaven Spirit World! So what if he is a tree controller? He can’t amount to much. If these humans dare to oppose us sea demons, we’ll just wipe them out completely. A bunch of ants daring to be so impudent before us dragons—”</p>
<p>“Bam!” A slap came before this sea demon could finish speaking. It sent him flying and made him vomit blood alongside some of his teeth.</p>
<p>“I want to see who would dare to destroy my human race.” A leisured voice came about. At this time, Li Qiye stepped into the garden and swept through the crowd with his belittling gaze.</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” Many charming spirits and sea demons immediately stood up to look at him.</p>
<p>After seeing him, Feiyan’s eyes emitted a terrifying murderous intent. Meiyu turned cold as well as she stared intensely at him.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave them dismissive glances and nonchalantly said: “Hand over Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao.”</p>
<p>Feiyan’s God-Monarch halos began to pulsate. She no longer hid her power as her aura ran rampant like a soaring dragon. These halos seemed to have the trajectory of stars as they shut out this area completely. The whole world turned cold before her bloodthirst.</p>
<p>At this time, she was showing off her strongest state, so those with shallow cultivations felt their legs trembling and had to stumble several steps back.</p>
<p>Even though they all knew she was a God-Monarch, it was still frightening when she emitted her God-Monarch’s might!</p>
<p>The sea demon that was slapped by Li Qiye immediately shouted after seeing Feiyan channeling her energy: “Goddess Shangguan, kill him. Crush this human ant into meat paste, show him no mercy for opposing our race.”</p>
<p>His expression became twisted after being slapped flying by Li Qiye in front of everyone, causing him to lose all face.</p>
<p>“Boom!” Li Qiye kicked him down again, creating a deep pit with blood dyeing the paved slate.</p>
<p>Li Qiye demanded: “Let them go, this is your last chance.”</p>
<p>Feiyan’s bloodthirst surged even more, causing everyone to shiver. Her murderous intent came sweeping by, seemingly flaying the flesh off of everyone standing nearby.</p>
<p>Feiyan mercilessly exclaimed: “I can let them go if you kneel and kowtow to profess your crime, then commit suicide. I will use your skull as an offering to my brother in heaven and let those two go. Otherwise, not only will you suffer a fate worse than death, those around you will suffer the same way!”</p>
<p>“It seems that you still don’t know life from death.” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
<p>“Come and accept your death!” The entire world was flipped upside down when Feiyan stepped forward. Her aura suppressed the entire garden so others couldn’t even move half a step. Some even felt the impulse to kneel.</p>
<p>Her aura rendered people out of breath before she even attacked. This made people exchange glances while feeling chills. Her fame as a God-Monarch was not baseless at all.</p>
<p>“When a God-Monarch is around, Virtuous Paragons are nothing.” Even an ordinary paragon from the previous generation had to murmur after feeling the pressure.</p>
<p>“Sister Shangguan, there’s no need to kill him so fast. Torture him first, let him taste the agony of betrayal and watch his friends die.” Gongsun Meiyu suddenly interjected right as Feiyan was about to attack.</p>
<p>With a buzz, a bright mirror emerged behind her head. Profound runes appeared right on the mirror; everything became as bright as scintillating snow, nothing could hide before its light.</p>
<p>“Celestial reflection…” A few people who knew about her looked at each other then quietly retreated to make some distance.</p>
<p>Celestial reflection was something that only charming spirits could do. People also called it divine reflection. It was extremely heaven-defying since it could solve the mysteries of the dao and understand the void as well as examine the changes of nature and sense the heaven and earth! She had cultivated this mirror-form constitution to a very high level, resulting in a technique that frightened the courage out of others.</p>
<p>At this time, two people walked out from a pavilion. It was Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao who were captured earlier. They looked sluggish as if they were puppets as they stood behind Gongsun Meiyu.</p>
<p>“Here are the ones you’re looking for. Unfortunately, they are my slaves now.” Meiyu’s smile was bewitching. The bright mirror behind her was even more influential as it robbed others of their will.</p>
<p>She viciously chuckled and continued: “Since you have killed my maid, your friends will be my new slaves. I will torture them until they choose the sweet release of death.”</p>
<p>Many charming spirits shuddered after seeing the two in a trance. A big shot murmured: “The Seductive Gaze of the divine reflection...”</p>
<p>The Seductive Gaze was Gongsun Meiyu’s terrifying art. She was born with a natural aptitude to be an enchantress and cultivated her mirror into this type of gaze. She was able to bewitch and control people to freely use as her puppets.</p>
<p>Li Qiye grimaced after seeing the two standing behind her and coldly uttered: “You’re courting death.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Is that so?” Meiyu smiled in response: “If you fall into my hands, I will show you a fate worse than death.”</p>
<p>With that, she smiled ominously and ordered: “You two, go kill him.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao immediately rushed out after hearing her command. They ferociously lunged for Li Qiye. Even though they weren’t particularly strong, especially Zhang Baitu who was quite weak, they used everything they had in order to kill Li Qiye.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye simply lowered both of his hands and immobilized the two on the spot. In the blink of an eye, his eyes shot out two rays of laws that struck their foreheads.</p>
<p>With the sound of something unlocking, the two of them seemed to be struck by lightning and took several steps back.</p>
<p>“Young Noble.” Both of them woke up right away with a clear pair of eyes. Li Qiye was able to dispel their confusion without a doubt.</p>
<p>Li Qiye then started walking towards Gongsun Meiyu.</p>
<p>“Oh? You are unexpectedly capable.” Meiyu was actually startled from this, but she maintained a confident appearance and revealed a seductive smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1261: Crushing Your Head</h4>
<p>Chapter 1261: Crushing Your Head</p>
<p>“Buzz!” Gongsun Meiyu’s divine mirror became dazzling and illuminated the entire garden. The whole scene turned as white as snow; the spectators had a hard time keeping their eyes open.</p>
<p>An eye emerged from her mirror. This extremely beautiful and spirited eye turned seductive in an instant. Its extraordinary splendor would cause people to instantly lose their way.</p>
<p>“Watch out!” Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao both shouted in horror. They had suffered under her technique before and knew just how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>However, Jian Xiaotie quickly dragged them away from the fight.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, do you really want to hit me?” Meiyu’s voice was seductive to the bones. It caused others to feel weak and caused their souls to leave their bodies. Her beautiful eyes emitted strange yet enchanting glows like the limpid autumn water.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stopped and stared obsessively at her. In a short period of time, her eyes became even more charming. It sent waves right into Li Qiye’s eyes in order to captivate him completely.</p>
<p>“You are so beautiful.” The confused Li Qiye murmured to himself while standing there motionlessly.</p>
<p>“So frightening.” Many people gasped before this scene. She could control the enemy without the need to fight at all.</p>
<p>Meiyu sneered after seeing Li Qiye falling under her control and voiced her disdain: “And here I thought that you were actually strong. You can’t even handle a single blow, such a dao heart is not worth mentioning.”</p>
<p>Feiyan coldly glared at him. Li Qiye was a dead man in her eyes, she could do whatever she wanted to him.</p>
<p>“Sister Shangguan, you can torture him however you want now.” Meiyu revealed her faint, enchanting smile again.</p>
<p>However, this charming smile seemed very scary to the spectators. The Seductive Gaze in her divine reflection was too much. Once her opponent lost their mind, she could manipulate them to her whim.</p>
<p>“Come over here.” She gently beckoned him over.</p>
<p>Li Qiye seemed incredibly sluggish while being completely under her control. After hearing her order, he slowly walked towards her.</p>
<p>Both Baitu and Yujiao were pale from fear as they cried out: “Young Noble!” However, Jian Xiaotie prevented them from trying to help him.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye stood before her. She looked at her puppet and felt quite pleased with herself before smiling to say: “Even if you could dispel the charm, your body itself won’t be able to resist the seduction. This is the most primal power, you can’t withstand it at all.”</p>
<p>She was completely confident in her seductive gaze. As long as one was fixated, it wouldn’t matter how powerful they were, they wouldn’t be able to control their mind. Their heart would start wavering until they fell completely under her control.</p>
<p>She contemptuously ordered: “Okay, kneel and bow your head to apologize to Miss Shangguan until you crush your skull completely.”</p>
<p>“Whoosh!” Suddenly, a hand grabbed her by the hair. This sudden development was completely unexpected. She couldn’t react in time because she was standing too close to him.</p>
<p>“Bam!” This hand that gripped her hair slammed her head into a stone pillar until blood spattered.</p>
<p>“Bang!” Another crash could be heard. Her head was swung into the pillar again. Her face was mangled completely beyond recognition. Her initially supreme features were smashed to a pulp and now looked quite scary.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was the culprit. He easily slammed her into the pillar mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Meiyu screamed as her blood energy erupted in order to escape his clutches. However, he shifted his grip to her neck. Under his Hell Suppressing Fist, she couldn’t move at all.</p>
<p>“Bang!” Her head slammed into a different pillar until it collapsed along with her skull. Blood and brain matter gushed out in the midst of this horrifying carnage.</p>
<p>“Die!” Feiyan shouted and swiftly took action. She intertwined her ten fingers to form a phoenix mudra. A phoenix roar echoed in the sky; it came killing with the aura of a God-Monarch. Its sweeping momentum could shatter the cosmos and sweep through both gods and devils alike.</p>
<p>A God-Monarch’s attack was incomparable. It could reverse the stars and flip the world over. She aimed to suppress Li Qiye with this one move in order to regain control of the situation.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at her phoenix mudra. He casually unleashed the Sky Destroyer Fist, a fist capable of shattering myriad dao and the vault of the sky with a sharp and overwhelming might.</p>
<p>“Screech—” The phoenix cried miserably as it was split into two in an instant.</p>
<p>After defeating the mudra, Li Qiye’s fist didn’t stop and kept flying towards Feiyan at an extreme speed.</p>
<p>It was too fast and sharp; Feiyan was aghast. Her halos came together to form a shield to block this attack.</p>
<p>However, the shield couldn’t stop this sharp strike. With a bang, the fist pierced through her chest. She was blown outside while her body shattered several pavilions in her path.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye didn’t pause. He slammed Meiyu into a different pillar. Pieces of her flesh continued to fly as her head was completely mashed.</p>
<p>Such a bloody scene scared everyone out of their minds. Some couldn’t even bear to watch. Meiyu used to be an irresistible temptress, but now her head had been deformed beyond recognition. The contrast was too great.</p>
<p>“Bam!” At this time, Meiyu’s body suddenly exploded into a blood mist. Li Qiye was forced several steps back from the explosion.</p>
<p>“Little animal, you have angered me!” An endless radiance blossomed from the bloody mist. Meiyu once again appeared before everyone.</p>
<p>Her aura turned even more brilliant and her charm was amplified. Each inch of her skin became even whiter and more perfect. She intentionally revealed herself to the crowd. The spectators felt their blood boiling after seeing her cleavage. Her sweet fragrance assaulted and mesmerized them as well.</p>
<p>This was the ultimate form of her seductive gaze. With her true fate at work, she was able to exert her seductive gaze to its limit. Her divine reflection projected itself on the sky and turned into a gigantic mirror. It poured down an incomparable light that was concentrated on Li Qiye.</p>
<p>At this moment, many cultivators in the garden felt their manhoods rise; they were immediately seduced by her sweet scent.</p>
<p>“Little animal, die!” Meiyu’s eyes were sparkling. Her temptation manifested into a physical form like a heavenly worm spitting out its strings to wrap around Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Insignificant trick.” Li Qye didn’t even lift a brow. With a buzz, his inner physique emerged. Universal laws began to suppress the heavens. When the Hell Suppressing Godly Physique came out, Li Qiye seemed to turn into an oppressive god.</p>
<p>“Bang!” He mercilessly stomped down on Meiyu.</p>
<p>“Activate!” Meiyu responded with a cry. The mirror in the sky shifted and illuminated Li Qiye even more.</p>
<p>“Boom!” It didn’t matter how strong her mirror was since it was useless before Li Qiye’s physique. She was instantly trampled beneath his foot.</p>
<p>Li Qiye coldly uttered: “You shouldn’t have schemed against my people.”</p>
<p>“You…” Meiyu screamed and wiggled back and forth in order to escape. Alas, she couldn’t move at all due to the weight of the Immortal Physique.</p>
<p>“Little friend, show mercy.” An old man suddenly appeared in the garden. He reached out towards Li Qiye in order to save Meiyu.</p>
<p>Li Qiye spread out his palm and a black hole emerged and instantly engulfed this man. Under the Heaven Devourer Evil Fist, even this old man could do nothing but accept his banishment.</p>
<p>“Ancestor!” Jian Xiaotie was shocked to see the banishment.</p>
<p>Li Qiye insipidly said: “No one can save you.” The Hell Suppressing Physique activated and came crashing down, obliterating Meiyu.</p>
<p>“No!” She screamed before her death. Her true fate was shattered and turned into bright particles that slowly dispersed. There was not the slightest trace of her left in the aftermath.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1262: The Person In The Coffin</h4>
<p>Chapter 1262: The Person In The Coffin</p>
<p>The entire scene was eerily quiet after Meiyu’s particles dispersed. The crowd could hear each other breathing.</p>
<p>There was no other sound because people had yet to return from their shock.</p>
<p>Feiyan, on the other hand, noticed that the situation was quite dire after her chest was penetrated. She immediately ran for dear life without pausing at all. At this moment, she didn’t give a damn about maintaining the appearance of a God-Monarch.</p>
<p>Eventually, people calmed down and noticed the messy garden. They stared in a daze at this astonishing event.</p>
<p>They all knew about Meiyu’s cultivation, and her seductive gaze was even more terrifying. As for Shangguan Feiyan, despite being an Intermediate Monarch, she was still not a match for Li Qiye and was suppressed after a single exchange.</p>
<p>One could say that she was being careless and didn’t use her weapons. Nevertheless, she was strong enough that her bare hands could still slay ordinary paragons. Thus, it was surprising that she suffered against Li Qiye and was forced to flee.</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao were slack-jawed and couldn’t react in a long time. They knew that Li Qiye was very strong, but not to this level. He crushed Meiyu like an ant!</p>
<p>Earlier, they were worried that he might be manipulated by her seductive gaze. It looked like their anxiety was needless since Li Qiye was only pretending earlier.</p>
<p>“Whoosh!” When everyone was still stunned, the void opened and an old man walked out. It was the person Li Qiye banished right before finishing off Meiyu. He was able to escape from deep space without suffering any damage in a leisurely manner — this was indicative of his great power.</p>
<p>Despite his gray hair, his complexion was still good for he was in high spirits and had a youthful vigor. Despite restraining his terrifying aura, just his eyes alone could shatter stars and create a grand dao. His gaze alone was enough to instill cold chills into others.</p>
<p>An old paragon recognized him and murmured: “The Jian Grandfather...”</p>
<p>He was the current master of the Jian Clan, the reason for this celebration — Jian Longwei.</p>
<p>“Friend, you have crossed the line.” Jian Longwei couldn’t help but shake his head: “This is stirring the hornet's nest, a great catastrophe. I’m afraid no one in the human race can protect you when it has escalated to this level.”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei had no hostility against Li Qiye. In fact, he even liked the guy for being so gifted. Unfortunately, he had killed Meiyu and gravely wounded Feiyan. This was offending two great powers in the Heaven Spirit World. Even Jian Longwei would have a difficult time protecting him after this major event.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and replied: “Only the Roaring Conch, it can’t be considered a catastrophe.”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei didn’t know how to respond after seeing Li Qiye’s relaxed demeanor. He assumed that this was a case of a calf not being afraid of a tiger and said: “The Roaring Conch can command a hundred tribes, to oppose them is to seek death—”</p>
<p>“Longwei, leave.” Before he could finish, a feeble voice sounded in his mind. This voice was not loud and only Jian Longwei could hear it.</p>
<p>However, he seemed to have been struck by lightning after hearing this voice. He even thought that he had misheard and found it completely unbelievable. This matter actually alerted their progenitor!</p>
<p>Li Qiye casually pointed forward and a portal appeared, then he disappeared inside it right away.</p>
<p>Many couldn’t react in time after the portal went away, so they just stood there looking silly.</p>
<p>“So strong.” Eventually, a person murmured after their mind returned: “No wonder why he dared to help the Peacock Tree refine a billion Teeming Fish. This is a mass murderer, a death god. No, we have to call him the Fiercest!”</p>
<p>“Fiercest.” Someone carefully thought over this title and found that it was very fitting. Gongsun Meiyu was the Profound Monarch’s favorite concubine, but Li Qiye killed her without a care. Just how decisive and ruthless was he? Such a person was indeed worthy of being called “Fiercest.”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei regained his composure as well and told Jian Xiaotie: “Xiaotie, take care of the guests.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the depths of the Jian Clan was a forbidden ground. A pond was sealed in this place, but it was more apt to call it a coffin made out of water.</p>
<p>This coffin was in the center and emitted a flashing amber hue. Each ray of light seemed tangible.</p>
<p>This liquid amber coffin was so strong that even the seal couldn’t contain it completely. People could still feel the faint immortal fragrance of a dragon’s saliva. After catching a whiff, they would feel their bloodline become several times stronger as if they were about to turn into a true dragon. They would feel that dragons were surging through the blood in their veins.</p>
<p>An old man dressed in a simple style was sleeping inside this coffin. Despite his humble robes, he had the image of a stately emperor. It was as if he had once soared above the nine heavens, rising above the world; he was a natural born leader.</p>
<p>“Buzz.” A portal appeared and Li Qiye came out of it. He went in front of the water coffin to look at the old man before slowly sitting down and giving a gentle sigh after a while.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The sound of water splashing came about. The old man submerged in this coffin floated above its surface and opened his eyes, revealing his devastating power.</p>
<p>He wanted to sit up, but Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “Jian Wen, there’s no need for formalities. If you climb out, it will be problematic to reseal you, so just lie there.”</p>
<p>He rested his head down and emotionally looked at Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, it really is you. You have regained your real body.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat there in a carefree manner and nodded: “It is thanks to Lil’ Blackie. He paid a great price.”</p>
<p>The old man in the coffin gently sighed in response: “Your Excellency, everything Blackie had was thanks to you. You gave him life, gave him invincibility. What he did was simply to repay you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat there and watched his friend who had grown old. He had seen this kind of thing too many times already.</p>
<p>“Time is merciless. Even the old man’s dragon saliva cannot seal you much longer.” Li Qiye lamented: “You are now old, no longer as mighty as before.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled in response: “I’m quite satisfied after living for so long. It is all due to the blessings of Your Excellency and Master.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye agreed: “That old man indeed treated you as his own. It looks like I was right to leave you and your sister to him.”</p>
<p>The old man chuckled. Even a powerful existence like him still smiled like a child before Li Qiye; it was as if he had returned to the past.</p>
<p>Back then, they were vagabonds without a home. Their days were filled with anxiety and fear, running from one place to another until they met a certain crow. That was the day that they found peace and understood what the word “happiness” meant.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, have you visited Big Sis?” The old man showed a pure smile like a little boy.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was quiet for a while before nodding his head: “Yes. I didn’t want to return after all these years, but I still had to bid her a final farewell.”</p>
<p>The old man pondered as well before replying: “Big Sis had no regrets. She only lamented the fact that she couldn't surpass her final dao test in her heart in order to accompany you to the very end. She wanted to apologize to you for being an obstacle to your eternal path.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently sighed: “Just let the past go, I don’t blame her either. I have forgotten about such distant matters. If I took everything to heart, I would never be at peace.”</p>
<p>The old man happily added: “I have always thought that Your Excellency would never return and that I wouldn’t be able to see you again. I’m quite content now to see you one last time.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded but stayed quiet.</p>
<p>Eventually, the old man softly asked: “Your Excellency, are you here to say goodbye?”</p>
<p>“You can say that.” Li Qiye affirmed: “It might be for good this time. Seeing you one last time will fulfill one of my wishes.”</p>
<p>He asked with a very strange and complicated expression: “Are you going up there now? It is a world where gods and emperors coexist...”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1263: Jian Wendi</h4>
<p>Chapter 1263: Jian Wendi</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled after seeing the old man’s dazed appearance and casually commented: “You said that your big sis couldn’t cross the final hurdle, but isn’t it the same for you?”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, you are right about that. It is the same for me, please don’t laugh.” The old man regained his composure and smiled wryly.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve in response: “If you wish to know, I can tell you.”</p>
<p>“No…” The old man shook his head with a firm demeanor: “I don’t want to know nor do I want to ask a single thing! He is he and I am I. Even if he was an Immortal Emperor admired by the masses, he is but a stranger in my mind!”</p>
<p>He resolutely declared: “Even though his blood runs through my veins, in my eyes, I have severed all ties with him, and so have my sister and mother. The moment we had to flee for dear life that day was the moment we were no longer related to him. My surname is Jian, my sister’s surname is Jian, and so is our mother’s!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sighed after seeing his expression: “Just let it go. Everything will be buried in the river of time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is over already, who will still remember or know about it?” The dazed old man quietly whispered: “But my big sis was haunted by this shadow her whole life. She was born to be extraordinary, destined to be great, yet she chose to live a mundane life! It was all because she had a father who wanted to kill his own daughter!”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi was the name of this old man. He was also the progenitor of the Jian Clan and Jian Wenxin’s younger brother.</p>
<p>The origin of the Jian Clan had always been a secret in the Heaven Spirit World. No one knew where they came from.</p>
<p>In fact, this matter hid a great secret that those who knew about would rather keep silent. The Jian Clan came from the Mortal Emperor World, and Jian Wendi and Jian Wenxin were the children of an Immortal Emperor. Unfortunately, they couldn’t enjoy their lives as a prince and princess.</p>
<p>This emperor used murder to prove his dao. The moment he reached the top, an inner demon appeared that he failed to defeat. Due to his murderous dao, he was doomed to a path of ruthless killing.</p>
<p>Before his ascension, he already had a wife and children. Because of this, he couldn’t reach the ultimate state of emotionlessness and ruthlessness. In order to do this, he had to remove his restraints. Thus, before the grand dao, he wanted to sever all emotions by killing his own blood in order to prove his dao.</p>
<p>Alas, he failed at first. His followers were able to save his family and take them away from him. However, he was only half a step away from becoming an emperor at this point, so he was completely unbeatable.</p>
<p>Those who protected his family couldn’t escape his wrath. From then on, Jian Wendi’s mother fled with her two children all across the nine worlds.</p>
<p>Later on, they met a crow who gave them the idea of faking their own deaths in order to escape.</p>
<p>Their father truly thought that they had died, so he finally defeated his inner demon to prove his dao and became an invincible Immortal Emperor.</p>
<p>After becoming an emperor, he became even more powerful. He was able to calculate his own bloodline and realized that his son and daughter were still alive.</p>
<p>The consequences were easy to imagine. All of the seniors that protected his wife and children died in the battle. The Dark Crow had to appear once again to rescue them from his clutches.</p>
<p>Because their father was an emperor, he was invincible in that generation with nobody capable of stopping him.</p>
<p>At the same time, the bloodline of their father ran through their bodies, so they couldn’t escape his vision no matter where they went.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in order to escape the hunt, their mother committed suicide while their bloodline was sealed by the Dark Crow. He then entrusted the children to another extremely powerful being that eventually hid them away.</p>
<p>Because their bloodline had been sealed and their bodies disappeared into the most secretive dimension in this world, even the emperor couldn’t calculate where they were hiding via their bloodline.</p>
<p>In the end, the emperor gave up. The sister and brother finally managed to escape this calamity.</p>
<p>As more generations went by, their sealed bloodline was eventually unlocked. They were able to appear in this world once more.</p>
<p>The invincible existence that had protected them all this time took them in as disciples. Because of this, these two were able to start the Jian Clan.</p>
<p>“It’s over, everything is now gone.” Jian Wendi eventually shook his head and said: “I am a member of the Jian Clan, the past no longer has anything to do with me.”</p>
<p>Ever since the start of their escape, the two had decided to take their mother’s surname in order to cut off all relations with their father.</p>
<p>Li Qiye felt a bit sorrowful while looking at Jian Wendi. Even though the two of them were able to escape, the whole experience still cast an indelible shadow that hung over their hearts for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Her sister was born to be extraordinary and extraordinary she was. Alas, she ultimately pursued the peaceful life of a mortal. Because of this, she gave up competing for the Heaven’s Will and a chance to become an emperor. Nevertheless, due to her great wisdom, she couldn’t truly experience this peaceful lifestyle.</p>
<p>Luckily, Jian Wendi handled it much better. Even though he couldn’t surpass the dao block in his heart, the Jian Clan — under his leadership — still prospered and became an inheritance that lasted to this day.</p>
<p>After a good while, Jian Wendi commented with regret: “It is a pity that I cannot follow you, Your Excellency, to serve you during your journey…”</p>
<p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve and flatly said: “It is enough for you to stay here and protect the Jian Clan. As for paying me back, your sister has done plenty. You don’t owe me anything.”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi disagreed: “No, Your Excellency. In my mind, you are my second parent. Without you, my sister and I wouldn’t have survived and my Jian Clan definitely wouldn’t be what it is today. I only hate the fact that I don’t wish to go further, I can’t face it!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sighed: “I’m also very happy to see the current Jian Clan. This place can be considered my home as well.”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi smiled innocently like a child in front of Li Qiye. It was thanks to Li Qiye that the two of them were able to have the courage to live on.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi issued a command: “Tell Longwei and Xiaotie to come here.”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei eventually entered with Jian Xiaotie behind him. The two were quite startled to see Li Qiye casually sitting there.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei was eight thousand years old now, but the times he had met the progenitor could be counted on one’s hand. Outside of earth-shattering events, the progenitor normally wouldn’t summon him.</p>
<p>As for Jian Xiaotie, he had only met the progenitor once. It was during his coming of age. From then on, he wasn’t summoned again.</p>
<p>In fact, not many members of any clan would be able to see their progenitors. This included the ancestors as well.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi ordered the two: “Kneel before His Excellency.”</p>
<p>Even though the two didn’t know the reason, they didn’t dare to disobey their progenitor, so they respectfully kneeled before Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi slowly said: “Longwei is the current clan master while Xiaotie is the next, so you two should know some things about our clan. His Excellency before you is our benefactor and the master of our clan! Our clan was able to exist because of his protection. Remember our eternal creed, His Excellency is our lord and his commands are my commands.”</p>
<p>The two of them were inevitably shocked to hear this. This was especially true for Longwei since he had been the clan master for a long time, so he was privy to a few secrets. He knew that there was a great and mysterious character that helped create the Jian Clan.</p>
<p>He didn’t expect that he would be able to see this legendary existence in his lifetime.</p>
<p>“This disciple greets Your Excellency.” He calmed down and bowed his head towards Li Qiye. Each bow was very sincere as his head touched the ground. Each knock seemingly came from his heart.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency…” Jian Xiaotie also did the same. He didn’t know as much as Longwei, but as the successor, he had still heard of a few things about this legend.</p>
<p>He didn’t expect to see a mythical being that could even ambush Immortal Emperors. Moreover, this existence had been right beside him for the last several days.</p>
<p>“Rise.” Li Qiye accepted the grand gesture from these two and gently waved his hand.</p>
<p>After these two stood up, Jian Wendi ordered: “Take your leave, I will talk to His Excellency now.”</p>
<p>They motioned a respectful gesture before quietly retreating.</p>
<p>“The children are filial and gifted at both fighting and scheming, so I am not worried about the Jian Clan at all.” Li Qiye nodded: “As long as the old geezer is still there, the Jian Clan just needs to do its own thing, nothing will be able to cause trouble for the clan as it continues to stand strong.”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1264: Garden In The Sky</h4>
<p>Chapter 1264: Garden In The Sky</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat together with Jian Wendi. The two of them chatted about different matters and the Jian Clan. Unwittingly, the two of them returned to the past when Jian Wendi was still a child while Li Qiye was still the same as ever.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, are you really going up again?” Jian Wendi knew the answer, but he still had to ask again.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled: “Yes, what must come shall come. I have to face it after all. You should know that no one can stop my journey to the very end. I am destined to do so because someone must.”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi knew that nothing could change this. The truth was that he knew what the answer was long ago.</p>
<p>In the past, his sister had tried to stop him as well, but like Li Qiye said, no one was able to stop his destiny.</p>
<p>“An age of gods and emperors together…” Jian Wendi sighed and didn’t know what to say. Perhaps he should wish Li Qiye luck.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and smiled: “It is a brilliant era that makes the blood boil. At the same time, it is also a cruel place. The greater the momentum, the more merciless it is.”</p>
<p>“I know, it is a shame that I won’t be able to see the scene of dragons competing against tigers with my own eyes.” Jian Wendi nodded softly.</p>
<p>Li Qiye replied: “You had the chance back then, you could have avoided Hong Tian’s generation and came out a few years later to become an emperor. Then you would have been able to see this brilliant era.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Jian Wendi revealed a smile that encompassed many different emotions. There was a mix of inexplicable bitterness yet acceptance as he answered: “Immortal Emperor… so what? Invincibility, so what? It is only an ephemeral firework blossoming above the river of time. I am very content with how many descendants I have now. There’s nothing else I would ask for.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye felt sentimental while looking at Jian Wendi. Neither of the brother and sister could overcome the void in their hearts.</p>
<p>Their father had left an unsurpassable shadow in their minds. It caused them to prefer a mundane life untempted by invincibility. Both were apprehensive about becoming an existence like their father.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi regretfully said: “I do wish that I could follow Your Excellency to the end of the world like Immortal Emperor Min Ren and the others.”</p>
<p>“I’m very happy about what you have today. Your Jian Clan is prosperous and stronger than anything.” Li Qiye happily smiled: “Plus, even if you become an Immortal Emperor, I wouldn’t want you to follow me to the end of the world. Like Immortal Emperor Min Ren and Empress Hong Tian, they have their own paths as well.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly explained: “The ultimate war is my personal ambition and desire. It has nothing to do with others, so I don’t want to tie them to my war chariot.”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi quietly nodded. There were too many things beyond his reach since someone as extraordinary as him was still trapped by his fate.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Qiye smiled and asked: “Has the old man run out again?”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi smiled back and replied: “It’s only natural that after being still for so long, Master would want to take a break and play outside.” [1. There is an idiom that is quite difficult to translate. The meaning is about a pendulum swinging from the extreme; the raw translation would be “motion from stillness”. In this case, Wendi is saying that his master has been quiet/reclusive for very long, so he naturally will want to come out and play as this is the natural order. I couldn’t really incorporate this particular idiom into the sentence without it sounding extremely rigid.]</p>
<p>“That’s good, I want to see him.” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
<p>With that, he gently tapped Jian Wendi’s shoulder and calmly said: “I should go now. Take care.”</p>
<p>Jian Wendi was quiet for a moment before nodding: “Your Excellency, take care. There is still a ways to go, I believe that you will eventually become invincible.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smilingly said before turning to leave: “Yes, nothing can stop my determination. Take care and live well!”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” He only managed to take a few steps before Jian Wendi shouted: “Will, will I be able to see you again?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t turn around, but he responded in a carefree manner: “I don’t know. Just consider this as our final farewell so that you can stop worrying about it.”</p>
<p>With that, he casually created a portal and disappeared.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi continued lying there in silence. Time seemed to have stopped for him.</p>
<p>Eventually, he quietly murmured: “See you again, Father.”</p>
<p>Tears inadvertently wetted his eyes as they closed.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The water splashed again as he sank into his water coffin to re-enter deep slumber. Perhaps when he woke again, it would be a different era.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In Rainbow City, there was a place where no one could visit. Many people didn’t know about it, including those from the Jian Clan. However, among those who did know, they called it the highest city or the final city in this region. Of course, some also referred to it as the place above the clouds.</p>
<p>It was not suitable to call this place a city since it was more of a garden floating in the clouds. At least, in appearance it was.</p>
<p>This great garden was not located in Dragonhark, Dragonwell, or even Dragonspring. It was floating in an unknown location.</p>
<p>Odd flowers and strange grasses were in full bloom. The whole garden had a wafting floral fragrance. Elegant and rich scents came from these flowers alongside very strange fragrances. This place had all kinds of rare species of the nine worlds. In the middle was a wooden house built in an exquisite manner.</p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine the craftsmanship that had gone into it. Perhaps during the building process, each wooden plank, beam, and column were dedicated for this building. Their weight, size, and appearance were scrutinized with an incomparably strict standard. The weight had to be perfect in order to make this house into a work of art.</p>
<p>There were many busy figures in this garden. Some were watering the flowers while others were taking care of the weeds or trimming the bushes. A few were loosening the soil and more were catching worms…</p>
<p>On a careful inspection, these busy people were all old men. Gray robes, huge coats, sleeveless shirts… all of their outfits were different as well.</p>
<p>They also looked different in terms of figures. Some were normal while others were incredibly thin or fat. However, at a second glance, regardless of their uniform or body shape, there was something very similar about them. It was difficult to pinpoint the similarity; perhaps it was their silhouette. This familiar contour gave others the feeling that they had seen these old men before.</p>
<p>In fact, if people were to think about it for a second, they would realize that they really had seen these old men before. For example, the old man that summoned the rainbow fish, the collector at Dragonhark Valley, or the shopkeeper at Rainbow Inn. All of them gave off this sense of familiarity, a deja vu of sorts.</p>
<p>Li Qiye appeared in this garden that was forbidden to outsiders without express permission from its master. Regardless of how powerful or heaven-defying one might be, they wouldn’t be able to enter this place.</p>
<p>Li Qiye had a beaming smile on his face while looking at the busy old men in this garden. He didn’t greet them and only headed straight for the wooden house.</p>
<p>The old men ignored Li Qiye as well and continued with their tasks as if they didn’t see his arrival.</p>
<p>In front of this cabin was a tea table with two wooden chairs. On one side was an old man fanning a fire to boil his tea. All of his attention was on this task. His eyes seemed to be jumping along with the fire while he was unaware of Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t break the old man’s focus and only smiled as he sat down. The wooden chair was so comfortable that it made people want to close their eyes to sleep. It was as if it was specifically tailored for Li Qiye. It fit his body perfectly. Just a bit longer would be too big while an inch less would make it too narrow. There was no room for criticism.</p>
<p>He slowly closed his eyes as if to sleep. Meanwhile, the old man making his tea still didn’t notice Li Qiye. All of his focus was on making his tea.</p>
<p>Eventually, the old man finally finished and added the tea leaves. A sweet fragrance came out as he poured himself a cup and one for Li Qiye as well.</p>
<p>The steam that rose from the hot tea actually condensed above the cups to form dragons. One could even faintly hear the wondrous cries of these dragons.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1265: Old Man</h4>
<p>Chapter 1265: Old Man</p>
<p>Li Qiye seemed to wake up as he accepted the teacup. He gently took a sip, letting the tea seep into his belly. There was an indescribable comfort that stemmed from the perfect temperature.</p>
<p>Dragon cries resounded from his belly as if he had just swallowed a gigantic dragon.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise: “A great tea like this dragon tea can only be found in this place.” The aftertaste was incredible as well.</p>
<p>He finally opened his eyes fully and found the garden to be at peace. The old men that were gardening earlier had all disappeared, only Li Qiye and the old tea-maker were left.</p>
<p>At this time, the old man seated himself in the other chair and slowly savored the taste of his tea in a natural and leisurely manner. It was as if he was drinking a tea of immortals. In fact, his tea was not far from being an immortal tea. Even Immortal Emperors wouldn’t necessarily be able to drink his dragon tea.</p>
<p>After finishing his cup, Li Qiye sighed with great satisfaction. The old man finished as well.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and teased: “Old man, it seems that you can’t stand the loneliness again? Is that why you are playing around like this?”</p>
<p>The old man lied down comfortably in his chair and chuckled: “Being in bed for too long makes my arms and legs numb, so I had to get up to do some work. Toiling is unavoidable in life after all.”</p>
<p>“Being hard at work is good, I was actually afraid you would panic from having nothing to do.” Li Qiye smiled back.</p>
<p>The old man happily looked at the countless strange flowers in the garden and said in a carefree manner: “What can I do with these old bones of mine? Don’t worry about that, Crow. Plus, I can’t leave the Giant Dragon Mountain either way, so I’m just running around and playing the merchant — just some coolie’s works.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed; he was truly enjoying the carefree atmosphere at the garden. This was a conversation with someone at the same level as him, yet they weren’t enemies. It was a very enjoyable matter.</p>
<p>“I thought you would continue to plot and hide behind the scenes until all the old men take action. I didn’t expect you to come out in this generation.” The old man stated: “It is quite surprising that you were able to resist the supreme artifact in the Immortal Demon Grotto as well. I actually thought that you would return there and try to seize it.”</p>
<p>“Am I really that kind of person?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “I have always been upright, I’m not the type to scheme like that.”</p>
<p>“Upright?” The old man burst out in laughter: “If a crow like you claims to be upright, then even the high heavens would start tearing up from laughing.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was amused as well. Eventually, he replied: “After I left, that existence in the grotto still figured out some way to make my situation very unstable. Lil’ Blackie was too anxious. In a fit of rage, he recklessly charged in there.” He sighed softly at this point.</p>
<p>“That brat always treated you as a father.” The old man dismissively said: “Outside of that little girl, nothing else is as important to him as you, so of course he did what he did.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye replied with remorse: “Back then when I took him to the Mortal Emperor World, I only hoped for him to be able to soar to the nine heavens like an eagle. Unfortunately, he couldn’t let go of a few things and decided to stay in the Mortal Emperor World. Because of that, well, you know what happened to him afterward.”</p>
<p>“His decision also made you lose the opportunity to seize the grotto. Haven’t you always been scheming for that item? Unfortunately, you failed.” The old man stood up and chuckled.</p>
<p>“It is true that I want the item, but only if it doesn't risk many people’s lives. I can only say that I got very close to doing so. I guess certain things were doomed from the start.” Li Qiye gently shook his head.</p>
<p>“Heh, this is fine too. If it wasn’t for Lil’ Blackie getting you out of there and, by chance, if you actually obtained that item, the old heavens would turn blind. If you could obtain all the supreme items that you wanted, how could others bear such injustice? Even the villainous heavens wouldn’t want to live on in such an unfair world.” The old man cheerfully gloated at Li Qiye’s misfortune.</p>
<p>“Just let the past go. I’ve grown tired of living after such a long life anyway.” Li Qiye smiled: “Since Lil’ Blackie has saved me, I’ll just live freely through this generation and go all out. I’ll finish what must be done, there’s no need to worry about life and death afterward.” [1. This sentence might not make sense unless you remember the artifact that is in the Immortal Demon Grotto and what it does.]</p>
<p>The old man emotionally sighed after insipidly stating: “Yes, it is tiresome to live for so long.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and teased: “I see that you are living quite well. You sleep for a bit then run out and play for a bit. How comfortable and carefree.”</p>
<p>The old man glared at him in response: “When the villainous heavens played me like this, what else can I do? I can’t die even if I want to, and if I want to live, I can only stay in this place! Luckily, my descendants didn’t let me down and managed to pass down my bloodline, so I don’t have many regrets.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at him and asked: “Have you not thought about going strong one more time to the end of the world?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, Dark Crow, don’t try to drag me down with you. This is your war, not mine. I’m just an ordinary old geezer now.” The old man chortled: “I am living a nice family life. Running around when I want to, making some tea when I feel like it, and sometimes beating up a few bad kids who won’t listen — I’m quite content with this kind of life already.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Back in that distant era, a dragon demon dared to fight all the way to the nine firmaments and opposed the villainous heavens himself. Where is that dragon now?”</p>
<p>“Damned crow, there’s no need to goad me.” The old man didn't become angry. Instead, he grinned and said: “I have no more aspirations and have nothing to say about my loss back then. I don’t have any grievances about being imprisoned here either. After all, I was not as strong as I imagined, but I can handle losing.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye pondered for a bit before nodding his head: “This is what I admire about you the most, you can see things clearly and are very open-minded. It is true that there is no humiliation in losing to the villainous heavens. This path is very difficult. For millions of years, countless others have tried, and just as many have become bones.”</p>
<p>“In the end, how many are still brooding right now?” Li Qiye gently sighed: “Being able to let things go is the sign of a real hero. I myself can’t get over this hurdle, I just can’t gracefully admit defeat and will try to get up from where I’ve fallen. No matter what it is or who it is, I will start from the beginning to sweep through it all by cutting down all those who try to stop me!”</p>
<p>“But being able to give up is really nice, really nice…” Li Qiye lamented: “By letting things go, everything else will feel acceptable in life. Or rather, many other things are insignificant compared to just being alive. As long as you don’t care, things that used to be important will no longer matter. Like the drifting clouds, they won’t be worth mentioning.”</p>
<p>“Damned crow, it is not the same for you.” The old man smiled and replied: “I have lost completely — this made me realize that I have other things to protect in life, such as my children.”</p>
<p>“If you give up, you would be wasting your immortality.” The old man reflected: “If possible, you should gamble everything just once. If you win, you will have everything. If you lose, at least lose everything as well after utilizing everything at your disposal.”</p>
<p>“After suffering an utter defeat, you might be able to see through it and let go.” With that, he smiled: “When you don’t have anything left to bet with, you will have no choice but to give up.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Li Qiye had a somber expression as he responded: “If I’m able to put everything on the table, then I might as well gamble it all away just once. When Wenxin asked me why I can’t stop, the truth is that I didn’t know back then either. Perhaps it is because I haven’t tasted true defeat, being left with nothing but empty hands. Maybe this defeat will even end with my death.”</p>
<p>“Regardless of victory or defeat or even death, there is nothing to be afraid of.” The old man said: “Your life has been quite productive. For many generations, who has led a more brilliant life than you? You have experienced and done everything possible. Even if you stay as an ant, it would still have been a good life.”</p>
<p>“An ant trapped between the heaven and earth…” Li Qiye eventually shook his head and smiled before putting on a determined look: “Even as an ant, I still don’t want to hide. One day, I will stand above all else. My destiny is my own, the heavens will not decide my fate!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I want to hear.” The old man laughed in agreement: “Even as an ant, you would still rather be an extraordinary ant than an insignificant one.”</p>
<p>“Well said.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Yes, I want to be an extraordinary ant!”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1266: A Joke For The Ages</h4>
<p>Chapter 1266: A Joke For The Ages</p>
<p>Li Qiye and the old man were quite pleased with their statements. They glanced at each other and laughed heartily; tears even came out.</p>
<p>They had experienced countless years and hardships. Once upon a time, they were the rulers at the peak of this world. Very rarely would they be able to laugh this sincerely.</p>
<p>In the eyes of outsiders, they were either unfathomable or too stern and stately. Others seldom spotted them laughing like this to the point their stomachs hurt.</p>
<p>They finally stopped after a long while.</p>
<p>“An ant between the heaven and earth, eh?” It took quite some time before the old man stopped grinning.</p>
<p>Li Qiye cheerfully added with a boisterous chuckle: “The villainous heavens is just a wretch!”</p>
<p>The two of them became tired from their own ruckus and sat back down to rest again with their eyes closed. It seemed that this kind of indulgence felt quite good for them.</p>
<p>In fact, this burst of laughter was very precious. As overlords, they rarely expressed their true feelings before others; they could only reveal their true selves before someone of the same level.</p>
<p>The old man smiled and spoke after resting for a bit: “Crow, in these long and boring years, it is a great joy in life to have met you.”</p>
<p>The gentle breeze blew by. Its gentle coolness was quite comforting, as if it was blowing all worldly troubles away.</p>
<p>“Geezer, I agree that there are fewer than few people who I can sit down and have a talk with.” Li Qiye still had his eyes closed as he happily replied: “Life is less boring from knowing you.”</p>
<p>The years were too long. For both the old man and the Dark Crow, there weren’t too many people that they could talk and laugh so freely with.</p>
<p>The world might be vast, but how many were actually qualified to become their friends?</p>
<p>The old man didn’t respond; he seemed to have fallen asleep in his wooden chair. Li Qiye did the same while basking in the sea breeze.</p>
<p>After a long time, Li Qiye commented: “Geezer, how come I don’t see as many clouds and mists in your mountain range this time? Are all of your kids staying at home obediently?”</p>
<p>“A wicked person just arrived. What if those little monkeys run wild and choose to be blind? You would then teach them a lesson by peeling their skin. I would lose all face if that were to happen, so I told them to play nice at home.” The old man answered with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled and leisurely said: “Don’t worry, with our friendship, I would show you some consideration. Even if I peeled their dragon scales, I would still spare their lives.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled in response. A bit later, he flatly asked: “Crow, you didn’t come here just to visit this old man, right?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye cheerfully replied: “Forget it, there’s no need to crawl out, your appearance is too terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t be so sure. Maybe one day, you will look even more horrifying than me. The villainous heavens won’t let you off so easily given your plans.” The old man laughed back.</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued: “We’ll talk again when that day comes. After all, the heavens has never forgiven anyone, so I don’t need it to show me any mercy either.”</p>
<p>The two of them paused their conversation again and enjoyed the serenity. Even though the outside world was endless, there was no need to worry about it in this place.</p>
<p>“Crow, what do you want?” After a long time, the old man finally spoke in a calm and plain manner. It was as if this was just an idle conversation between old friends.</p>
<p>Li Qiye opened his eyes to look at the drifting clouds up in the blue sky. He didn’t answer right away.</p>
<p>“The Immortal Dragon Rune, a weapon, or maybe my lifeguarding artifacts?” The old man leisurely listed a couple items.</p>
<p>This plain manner of speaking made it seems like the topic was insignificant, but if others were to find out that he was referring to supreme treasures, they would be scared silly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, you can keep your little items. I would be too greedy if I tried to take them away from you.” Li Qiye only smiled.</p>
<p>The old man smiled as well and didn’t seem to care too much.</p>
<p>“Geezer.” Eventually, Li Qiye got to the point: “Back then, that brat Bu Si came to ask you for help, correct?”</p>
<p>It was the old man’s turn to be quiet.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled before continuing: “I don’t know what that brat was playing with or how he shattered. I don’t care what plans he left behind either, I only want to know about one thing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it's as you guessed, I have been to the Bonesea.” The old man didn’t try to conceal this at all.</p>
<p>Li Qiye went on: “I knew it. When his skeletal horse disappeared here, I understood some matters right away. That brat was still thinking about those things.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled: “Bu Si’s foresight was not bad, but it is quite limited compared to yours. He was fixated on becoming immortal. However, all of this led back to one thing; it must be traced back to the source.”</p>
<p>Immortal Emperor Bu Si had died many times just to revive again. He was a reason for awe during his generation, but in the mouth of these two, he was only a junior.</p>
<p>Li Qiye eventually spoke: “Old man, I want you to open it for me.”</p>
<p>“Hah, Crow, that’s easy for you to say.” The old man responded: “I have spent painstaking efforts on it already. Even though I’m not using it, who knows if I will need it in the future or not?”</p>
<p>“I know.” Li Qiye smiled: “You aren’t sure if that day will come either, but since you aren’t using it right now, lend it to me.”</p>
<p>“Crow, what are you thinking?” The old man was still hesitant: “Don’t tell me you are looking at the Trident? It won’t be that easy.”</p>
<p>“Heh, old geezer, you are underestimating me too much.” Li Qiye answered: “The Trident might be nice, but I have never thought about obtaining it. I have more than enough treasures in this generation so possessing it doesn’t matter. There’s no need to suffer in the Bonesea just for the Trident.”</p>
<p>“The Bonesea, eh.” The old man sighed after hearing this: “That day will come to Heaven Spirit after all. Many things are simply inevitable.”</p>
<p>The Bonesea was one of the twelve burial grounds and the most dangerous place in the Heaven Spirit World. It was full of mysteries, a land where countless have fallen, but this didn’t deter people from going there.</p>
<p>“That place isn’t pleasant at all.” Li Qiye chuckled: “But I do have to admit that it isn’t a bad location. It is worthy of making so many people drool with greed.”</p>
<p>“Greed?” The old man chortled: “It’s the same for all twelve burial grounds, but in those devilish places, only the living can enjoy the spoils.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter since I’m not trying to find a nest or anything.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, there is something I need over there. Old man, you have been there many times before, so I need you to open it for me. This is the only way for me to get things done.”</p>
<p>The old man didn’t answer; it was as if he was sleeping in his chair. Li Qiye didn’t rush him either. It seemed as if he had forgotten about his own question while enjoying the breeze.</p>
<p>“Crow.” The old man took a long time before answering: “We might be friends. After all, I took in those two as my disciples since I needed to pass down my lineage. The brat married my daughter and this was perfect to make up for my lacking bloodline. However…”</p>
<p>“I know, there is no free lunch.” Li Qiye replied: “Geezer, tell me what you want. As long as I can get it, I will seriously consider.”</p>
<p>The old man lied there as if he was contemplating the issue. Eventually, he opened his mouth: “Crow, I am now old. I don’t know how much longer this old body of mine can last. I have already obtained pretty much everything I’ve ever wanted. As for treasures, they are just worldly possessions, I have no need for them.”</p>
<p>“Old man, don’t tell me you want to betroth another daughter somewhere to me.” Li Qiye joked: “If that’s the case, then forget it.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled and shook his head: “Come on, Crow, others don’t know who you are, but I do. If I betroth a daughter to you, she’ll just live a life of suffering! I don’t want my little girl to wash her face with tears every day.”</p>
<p>“My little girls aren’t worthy to climb up your high branch.” The old man half-jokingly smiled and said: “I only want them to be safe and live happily.” [1. The first sentence is an expression of polite refusal, it is quite common.]</p>

<h4>Chapter 1267: Bidding Farewell</h4>
<p>Chapter 1267: Bidding Farewell</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t mind the rejection from the old man, evident by his smile.</p>
<p>The old man eventually continued: “Like I said, Crow, I don’t have any more pursuits, and this is the case for that item too. If you want it, then I shall perform the opening.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Li Qiye mused it through and said: “After all is said and done, old man, you want me to owe you a favor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you will owe me a favor.” The old man happily replied: “Crow, if you lose, then consider the item as a gift. But if you win... then regardless of what happens in the future, in the new world and era, just don’t forget that you owe me a favor.”</p>
<p>He leisurely went on: “It doesn’t matter to me how much longer I have to live, I just hope that you can remember this favor and take care of my descendants. What do you think, Crow?”</p>
<p>“Old man, in the end you just want me to babysit your descendants.” Li Qiye laughed it up and replied: “Everyone says that those who manage to grow old are all wily. You are quite calculating nowadays.”</p>
<p>“Old people are sentimental as well.” The old man only smiled: “Even though I don’t have that many children, their very being is a treasure. If I actually die one day, perhaps they will become other people’s prey.”</p>
<p>“Dragons, huh.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “If that day actually comes, dragon blood will indeed be very tempting. After all, who doesn’t want a piece of such a nice meal?”</p>
<p>The old man cheerfully replied: “I do want the little monkeys to turn into true dragons one day, but even if that day comes, it will be a calamity as well. The gods and emperors will all want them.”</p>
<p>After a long time, Li Qiye gave a carefree smile and declared: “Why not?! If I can win the final war, then nothing else will matter. I’ll just be a babysitter then; old man, you have my promise.”</p>
<p>The old man only gave a plain smile. This was within his expectations, so he wasn’t overly surprised or lost in jubilation.</p>
<p>The conversation stopped for a while before the old man spoke again: “About Little Jian... I’m sorry, even as her master, I was powerless to help her.”</p>
<p>There was a doleful look on Li Qiye’s face. He eventually sighed and said: “Old man, you were a good master and did all you could for both the brat and the girl.”</p>
<p>“There are a few uncrossable ridges in life. Not everyone can always be strong.” He helplessly lamented: “She was nearly flawless. It is a shame that she couldn’t escape the shadow of her past.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere became solemn. There were a few things that couldn’t be changed by even the most heaven-defying of people.</p>
<p>The old man eased up and smiled: “Well, I don't think she had any regrets even in her last moments. In fact, you might be the only one who feels remorse.”</p>
<p>“It was her choice back then.” Li Qiye faintly smiled: “She wanted to die due to her pursuit of normality. She was a good girl and has done many things for me.”</p>
<p>“Just dismiss the past from your mind.” The old man added: “You have always been the most important person in the girl’s heart, and she believed that she lived a fulfilling life. Despite not being able to overcome her shadow, you brought light to her world. Amidst the hues of carnage and shades of despair, you gave them life. When they were at their most vulnerable, you gave them the courage to live on.”</p>
<p>“Thus, consign the past to oblivion.” The old man nonchalantly declared: “The brat once said, the light you have given them is brighter than the darkness of the past.”</p>
<p>“But the light cannot shine to every corner of the world.” Li Qiye had a profound expression as he stared at the sky. It was as if he was peering through everything. After a while, he flatly replied: “There is no savior in this world. Everyone needs to rely on themselves.”</p>
<p>The old man laughed in response: “A savior? Those types of people should go to hell! Everyone wants a savior, but such beliefs will turn this savior into a devil! They would only breed inactivity and stagnation. People should be their own saviors; if they can’t save or change their own lives, how can a ‘savior’ do anything?”</p>
<p>“Makes sense.” Li Qiye bemoaned: “I saved the lives of those two, but could not save them from their fate.”</p>
<p>“Damn it!” In the end, the old man playfully cursed: “Crow, our combined age is older than just about anyone, why are we bewailing like two old women? To hell with this melancholic conversation!”</p>
<p>“Well, old people tend to blabber on and on.” Li Qiye grinned.</p>
<p>The two ended up quietly looking at the sky as if it was the most beautiful scene in the world.</p>
<p>This moment of solace was undisturbable. It was a time true overlords like them could find peace.</p>
<p>After a long time, the old man spoke again: “Crow, I will not see you off. Return from whence you came.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye quipped: “Fine, it would be too scary if you climbed out of the nest. I know the way.”</p>
<p>Just like that, Li Qiye stood up and looked at the old man to say: “Geezer, this is farewell. Perhaps this will be our last meeting.”</p>
<p>“Take care, damned crow.” The old man responded with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded and turned around without saying anything else.</p>
<p>“Crow!” He didn’t get far before the old man cried out. Li Qiye paused his steps.</p>
<p>The old man sat up straight and put on a solemn expression to say: “There are some legends that you have probably heard about. Once you cross that line and reach a certain threshold, destruction is imminent.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a legend.” Li Qiye became quite austere as well: “It is the truth and I’ll face it even when I have to cross that juncture.”</p>
<p>The old man slowly asked: “Are you prepared?”</p>
<p>“I shall be fearless and fight to the very end when that day comes. As long as I don’t fall, nothing will happen!” His voice resounded in the clouds.</p>
<p>The old man softly sighed and murmured: “The inevitable will come after all. I’m afraid no one will be able to escape.”</p>
<p>“I believe you can.” Li Qiye joked: “Old man, be ready for when it does come. I know you have the power to do so.”</p>
<p>He left after saying this.</p>
<p>The old man sat there in silence. After a very long time, he muttered to himself: “Either the start of a new age or the withering of all...”</p>
<p>He ended with a woeful sigh and disappeared. The garden became extremely quiet. This was an eerie silence. If it wasn’t for the odd flowers and other vegetation here and there, people would mistake this place for a dead zone.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Li Qiye finally returned to the Jian Mansion and was immediately greeted by Jian Longwei and Jian Xiaotie. They bowed before him and said: “Your Excellency.”</p>
<p>“No need for formalities.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “Act as before. I won’t be staying here for too long, I will be leaving after finishing some matters.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, the two couldn’t do anything except bow their heads again. They hoped that Li Qiye could stay and teach them a thing or two. In their eyes, if they could be taught by the legendary teacher of Immortal Emperors, they would gain lifelong benefits from it.</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie busily told Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, a few things have happened at Dongting Lake, so Master Hong wishes to see you.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye ordered: “Tell him to come and see me. Dongting Lake has ties with me, so I shall help them.”</p>
<p>A bit later, Hong Tianzhou came running in. He quickly bowed his head after seeing Li Qiye: “Young Noble, things aren’t looking too good. Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village demand an answer from us or else they’ll send in their troops.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye had killed Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion. This enraged these two powers, prompting them to demand that the lake hand Li Qiye over. Otherwise, they would crush the lake.</p>
<p>“Send in their troops?” Li Qiye smiled: “Let them come so that their blood can dye the blue ocean red. This shall be a baptism for the sea demons to understand the strength of the human race.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou was shocked after hearing this. He couldn’t help but recall the events at the Peacock Land and how terrifying it must have been when a billion fish were sacrificed!</p>
<p>“Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village are nothing.” Jian Xiaotie was stirred. He said: “Give the order, Your Excellency. Our disciples shall trample both of them with haste.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou was stunned after hearing this. Even the Jian Clan was working for Li Qiye? This was simply inconceivable to him.</p>
<p>He calmed down and shuddered before hesitantly speaking: “I heard the Bloodshark Sovereign is a sea god…”</p>
<p>“Just a false god.” Jian Longwei replied nonchalantly: “Does he really think he is a sea god after being recognized by the Trident? If he dares to show himself, I’ll behead him in front of Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei declared this in a matter-of-fact manner. This was enough to show the strength of their clan!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1268: Besieged</h4>
<p>Chapter 1268: Besieged</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou was astonished after hearing this. If an existence like the Bloodshark Sovereign was regarded with such disdain, then just how fierce and domineering was this Jian Longwei?</p>
<p>At the same time, he felt his blood boiling because his lake would definitely be able to overcome this crisis with the Jian Clan’s help.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it myself.” Li Qiye voiced his refusal with a gesture and flatly said: “It is time for the sea demons to open their eyes to the proud human race. Let them know that even at the Dragon Demon Sea, humans can still suppress the heavens!”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei didn’t dare to compete against Li Qiye for this merit. They understood that this person was a supreme overlord. Even if a sea god came along, they would be annihilated. Li Qiye was someone who had killed Immortal Emperors after all!</p>
<p>Li Qiye told Hong Tianzhou: “If the enemies come sieging, then we shall fight and bury them beneath the sea.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou opened his mouth, but no words came out due to some hesitation.</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “No need for scruples, say what you want.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou took a deep breath and made up his mind: “The ancestors, they, they want to negotiate for peace and are willing to accept the demands from Wyvern and the village.”</p>
<p>“Negotiate for peace?” Li Qiye laughed and coldly uttered: “Since when did Dongting Lake become so weak? Would your ancestors ever negotiate with their enemies? When they were still around, surrender would not cross their minds even if they were whittled down to the very last man on the battlefield! Their bones were cast from iron and their hot blood could erect the strongest citadel in this world!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye angrily scolded Hong Tianzhou: “In those years, Godkings and imperial lineages were nothing in your ancestors’ eyes. The banners of your clans symbolized a will made of steel and the most invincible corp that annihilated their enemies and crushed all cities in their way. But look at their descendants now. Even ants like Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village can walk all over you, subjecting you to servility! Have you no shame in letting down their supreme, hard-earned prestige?”</p>
<p>Tianzhou felt his face and blood getting hotter. He recalled the glory days of his ancestors when Dongting Lake could look at the rest of the world with disdain. It was just as Li Qiye had said, his ancestors were invincible with nerves of steel.</p>
<p>When they were alive, they proudly trod through the nine worlds and swept through all of their enemies. Hong Tianzhou was ignited. If they were to kneel before these great powers today, it would be a great letdown to their ancestors!</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhou threw caution to the wind and clenched his teeth before declaring: “Young Noble, if you are willing to help me, I am ready to lead our disciples to battle instead of negotiating for peace, even if the elders do not agree!”</p>
<p>“It is good that you have this determination.” Li Qiye looked at him and nodded: “Return to Dongting Lake and observe how Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village, these ants, shall be trampled by your ancestors! Let the descendants of the lake remember their invincibility once more so that they will never dishonor their ancestors’ prestige again!”</p>
<p>“We shall fight alongside you, Young Noble!” Hong Tianzhou’s blood was boiling in this moment as he clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei nodded his head approvingly after seeing this. He knew that Hong Tianzhou’s momentary burst of heroism had won Li Qiye’s favor. This will change the fate of the lake as well as his own.</p>
<p>If he had faltered earlier and wanted to negotiate, Li Qiye would drop this matter right then and there. From then on, the lake would never rise again after falling into the hands of its enemies.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Both Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were furious at the murderer, Li Qiye. Shangguan Feiyan, who had suffered defeat to him, vowed to kill him as well.</p>
<p>In just one night, these two powers mustered a one-hundred-thousand-strong army. They quickly mobilized to Dongting Lake and released a message about their intent to destroy it.</p>
<p>This commotion excited this marine region. Many cultivators and sects eagerly awaited the show. Some sea demons were quietly gathering in the dark as well.</p>
<p>Dongting Lake was coveted by many due to its rich nature. So now, when the lake was about to fall, everyone would want to share a cup of the soup.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the sea demon sects close to Dongting Lake. They were secretly waiting for this battle to end. If the lake were to lose, then they would divide it. If the other two powers were to lose, then that would signal an eventually decline, meaning that there would be more promising territories up for grabs.</p>
<p>“Dongting Lake, listen up. Hand over the human brat, Li Qiye, and put down your weapons in surrender. We may forgive you then. Otherwise, your lake shall be crushed!” The village master and king of Wyvern personally led this expedition.</p>
<p>Before the grand army had even arrived, they already sent out this demand to the lake.</p>
<p>With the siege looming over their heads, everyone in the lake became quite nervous. The ancestors here held a meeting throughout the entire night.</p>
<p>The Xu, Lin, and Hong Clans were very unhappy with Hong Tianzhou for contributing to this trouble. It could even be said that they were furious. In their eyes, he was inviting a disaster to the lake.</p>
<p>Originally, they wanted to form a marriage pact with Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. This development would be mutually beneficial since they could bolster their own status and authority. However, there were no longer any marriages, only enmity.</p>
<p>“Rumble!” On this day, this sea region was full of monstrous waves. Two great armies came from both sides of the lake in a pincer maneuver.</p>
<p>On the left was Wyvern and on the right was the Bloodshark Village. This was a premeditated military deployment.</p>
<p>Wyvern’s army consisted of many gigantic serpents soaring above the surface. This was a sea demon lineage that claimed to be descended from true dragons; the blood of true dragons flowed inside them.</p>
<p>Of course, this was only them exaggerating their own worth. A more credible explanation was that their ancestor was a gigantic sea serpent. The dragon blood inside them was very thin. As for what type of dragon it was, this was still up for debate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the disciples from Wyvern were born as sea serpents. After becoming powerful enough, they would finally gain a humanoid form. Having a humanoid form at birth meant that their bloodline was extremely noble. [1. Just a clarification on the name Wyvern. The raw word means “a dragon with horns not yet grown”, thus a lower-level dragon. I consider wyvern to be closely related to dragons, but at a lower level, so I chose Wyvern. The issue here is that the author is talking about the traditional Chinese dragon, which is more of a serpent, to describe these creatures. If I knew this beforehand, I probably wouldn’t have chosen Wyvern. Maybe Hydra or Drake (not the rapper) would have been a better fit, or Hornless Dragon Country to play it really safe.]</p>
<p>Of course, the masters of this country were willing to maintain their true forms because it had a greater battle prowess. This, however, was very unfavorable for passing down their bloodline.</p>
<p>At this time, a very long sea serpent resembling a gigantic dragon swam closer with a ferocious momentum. It looked like 100,000 dragons were dancing in the sky.</p>
<p>At the same time, bloodsharks were cutting through the towering waves. Each of them was quite large, so surging tides were generated with each sweep of their tails.</p>
<p>They had long and sharp white teeth. When they opened their jaws, these teeth looked just like swords; their cold glints instilled fear into the spectators.</p>
<p>Old men were standing on some of them. These were all elders with soaring blood energies that made it seem as if they wanted to tear the world apart.</p>
<p>“Dongting Lake, we give you one day to hand over Li Qiye and surrender or face the consequences!” Shangguan Feiyan finally showed herself in this great army with her divine halos.</p>
<p>She fled the Jian Clan after suffering a complete defeat and was able to stay alive. This time, she came back with help.</p>
<p>She didn’t only want revenge but also to take this opportunity to turn Dongting Lake into her own. She came prepared this time and had great confidence in herself. Even if Li Qiye and the lake were stronger than expected, they would still die!</p>
<p>The encirclement around the lake left the crowd with varying emotions. Some were happy, some were shocked, and some had ulterior motives. Of course, there were some spectators that were watching purely for entertainment.</p>
<p>Someone murmured while watching Dongting Lake under siege: “Shangguan Feiyan wants to wash away the humiliation from the Jian Clan. Li Qiye was really vicious then.”</p>
<p>“He is indeed very ruthless, he even dared to kill the concubine of the Profound Monarch. It looks like he doesn’t give a damn about anything.” A sea demon sect master said: “But he might have difficulty escaping unscathed this time, even with Dongting Lake’s protection. I heard Shangguan Feiyan didn’t only come prepared, she also brought a weapon of a sea god. More importantly, I heard some rumors that she has been able to convince the Bloodshark Sovereign to come and personally destroy the lake.”</p>
<p>“The Bloodshark Sovereign!” Both humans and sea demons were shivering after hearing this name.</p>
<p>“Wow, a legendary sea god. When he comes out, who will be able to contend against him?” A newly debuted cultivator was full of awe.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1269: Foreign Aggression And Internal Turmoil</h4>
<p>Chapter 1269: Foreign Aggression And Internal Turmoil</p>
<p>The Bloodshark Sovereign’s reputation spread far and wide. Many people were startled to hear this name. This was especially true for the youth who had just made their debut; they thought of the sovereign as an untouchable existence.</p>
<p>“It really is a bit too much to call him a sea god, but he is powerful without a doubt.” A paragon who knew about what happened back then shook his head: “Yes, I can’t deny that he is strong, but he didn’t become a sea god back then. The Trident ultimately abandoned him.”</p>
<p>“Even if he isn’t a sea god, if a real one doesn’t show up, who can stop him?” A youth said: “Once the sovereign is here, Dongting Lake will be destroyed and Li Qiye will die. This is fine, the humans will know the consequences of opposing sea demons in this region.”</p>
<p>Some humans were quite annoyed at this rhetoric. Another couldn’t help but retort: “Generations are always changing. So what if the Bloodshark Sovereign is strong? Li Qiye is the strongest genius of the human race. He has sacrificed billions of Teeming Fish, defeated Feiyan with one hand and stomped Meiyu to death. He will be invincible in the younger generation!”</p>
<p>The humans had been weak in this world for very long, but they had high hopes in Li Qiye, the rising star of the younger generation. If, say, a human could become an Immortal Emperor in this generation, then the human race would have a greater status. They could even suppress the sea demons in this world.</p>
<p>“Hmph, don’t flatter him too much.” An unhappy young sea demon replied: “Everyone in the world knows that it was the Peacock Tree who performed the sacrifice, Li Qiye was only the errand boy. As for him hurting Miss Shangguan, it was only because he is a despicable wretch and ambushed her when she wasn’t paying attention. Otherwise, how could he hurt a God-Monarch like her?”</p>
<p>“Oh? Then what about Gongsun Meiyu? He killed her with one stomp. Hmph, in my eyes, he will surely become the next Immortal Emperor.” The human cultivator didn’t back down: “Maybe you sea demons are afraid of him becoming an emperor and suppressing you all…”</p>
<p>Before one knew it, small quarrels broke out among the youths before the battle had even started. The humans and sea demons were unrelenting. The young sea demons were certain of Wyvern and Bloodshark Village’s victory while the young humans had absolute confidence in Li Qiye killing Feiyan and crushing Wyvern.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the older generation was quiet, especially the ones with sects closest to Dongting Lake. Regardless of the victor, this war might spread to them as well.</p>
<p>“Dongting Lake, huh.” A charming spirit imperial lineage heard this news. An ancestor smiled and gently shook his head: “It has been too long, the sea demons have probably forgotten how the lake was established. Back then, in the entire Dragon Demon Sea, they didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. But now, when the lake is in decline, those ants actually want a piece of the cake. Fine then, let them take the lead. I want to see if the lake is still as strong as before or not!”</p>
<p>The 100,000 strong army surrounded the lake in a short period of time. Alarms rang everywhere across the lake. It didn’t matter if the disciples were willing to fight or not, they had to prepare for war.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu brought Hong Yujiao back to the lake overnight. Of course, Li Qiye was with them as well.</p>
<p>The lake had entered a state of alert. All locations were heavily guarded with checkpoints scattered across the eighteen docks full of patrolling disciples.</p>
<p>The eighteen docks were the largest foundations of the lake as well as their most fortified strongholds.</p>
<p>The great clans all had their businesses in these docks. According to the iron laws of the lake, these docks and mountains belonged to the lake itself and couldn’t become private properties. For a long time, the clans obeyed these creeds and ruled the lake together.</p>
<p>However, the ancestors later on abandoned the iron laws in order to gain more power. They divided the eighteen docks and the nearby mountains into their own properties.</p>
<p>With that, the division of power became chaotic and messy. Changes of power were frequent, resulting in the lake being lost in chaos.</p>
<p>From then on, the clans became even more disunified and followed their own whims. By only worrying about themselves, many past covenants and pacts with other powers could no longer be carried out.</p>
<p>After Hong Tianzhu returned, he saw many disciples along the way. However, the disciples looked at them with strange stares. Some even avoided the group like a plague.</p>
<p>After seeing this situation, Tianzhu felt quite negative and knew that something big had happened. He knew that the situation was not favorable.</p>
<p>Even juniors like Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin could feel that something was amiss. They became quite nervous as well.</p>
<p>Only Li Qiye was smiling without a care while leisurely walking through the lake.</p>
<p>A disciple quickly told Miss Lin along the way: “Senior Sister Lin, Senior Uncle has called for you.”</p>
<p>With that, Miss Lin stopped to look at Li Qiye and Hong Tianzhu.</p>
<p>In fact, this didn’t only happen to her, several other disciples had the same happen to them.</p>
<p>“Brother Xu, the ancestor wants you to come back right now…” Previously, many disciples didn’t know how to start this conversation, but after the Lin disciple took the initiative, they all came up and opened their mouths.</p>
<p>The group consisted of many excellent disciples from the different clans. They came with Hong Tianzhu to the Jian Clan in order to befriend them.</p>
<p>These disciples glanced at Hong Tianzhu at this time. They weren’t stupid and knew that something was wrong.</p>
<p>In their minds, Hong Tianzhu was a good clan master. He was ambitious with great vision, so they were willing to follow him.</p>
<p>“You all should go back.” Tianzhu gently sighed. He knew exactly what was going on, but he didn’t explicitly reveal it.</p>
<p>These disciples were silent for a moment. Miss Lin bit her lips and secretly glanced over at Li Qiye. In the end, she gathered courage out of nowhere and said: “Junior Brother, you go back, I won’t be returning just yet.”</p>
<p>Miss Lin and Hong Yujiao were good friends. They grew up as sisters, so their bond was quite deep. In this key moment, she chose to weather the storm together with Hong Yujiao.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m willing to follow the sect master as well.” A different senior brother said: “Go back and tell that ancestor this: if the lake has made any decision, it should be publicly announced. Don’t treat us as pawns for those ancestors’ benefits.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, senior sisters aren’t objects, the ancestors can’t betroth them to whoever they want. One day, it might be us next.” A male disciple stated his displeasure as well.</p>
<p>Some of the disciples felt cheated after finding out that the ancestors from several clans had privately decided the marriage of the two girls. They weren’t stupid. Today, it was these two, tomorrow, it could be them!</p>
<p>Such arbitrary decisions had made them very unhappy. Moreover, Hong Tianzhu was vigorously opposing these marriages. This was something as clear as day to them.</p>
<p>At the very least, their current master was willing to fight for their sake. But as for those ancestors, they treated marriages as a means for their own gains. It inevitably led to some aversion in the minds of these brilliant disciples.</p>
<p>“Yes, we are willing to follow Clan Master through the turmoil. Everything should be transparent instead of being decided in secret meetings! We are not cattle!” All the other disciples were quite unhappy.</p>
<p>After seeing the revolt, Li Qiye smiled and commented: “Not returning is fine.”</p>
<p>The group’s eyes darted towards Li Qiye. Even though they hadn’t known him for too long, he gave them great confidence. His invincibility and decisiveness had conquered their hearts.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have decided! The fate of Dongting Lake should be decided by everyone together, not a few ancestors!” One more disciple concurred.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu gently sighed after seeing this. He didn’t know whether to be happy or hapless. He was glad because at least the younger generation was opposing the old. What made him feel sad was that a disaster was befalling the lake, yet these ancestors were still vying for their own benefits.</p>
<p>“Master!” A male disciple rushed over. He immediately whispered after seeing Hong Tianzhu: “Master, you need to run now. The ancestors have decided to depose you and want to keep you under house arrest. I heard them privately say that they want to hand you over to Wyvern as a token of apology!”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression sank. He understood why those disciples from before looked at him as if he was a plague.</p>
<p>Being deposed was something he had expected, but being handed over to Wyvern never crossed his mind.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1270: Glory Of The Ancestors</h4>
<p>Chapter 1270: Glory Of The Ancestors</p>
<p>After hearing this, the disciples accompanying Hong Tianzhu were infuriated. This had completely exceeded their imaginations.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao indignantly asked: “The ancestors are going too far. Do our Hong ancestors share the same opinion?”</p>
<p>The messenger nodded: “Our ancestors have passed this proposal as well after discussing things.”</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao angrily stated: “Do they have no shame? My father has toiled for the clan even if he didn’t perform any meritorious deeds. If a great power sends off their own sect master to another power as a token of apology, how will we ever show our face in Heaven Spirit again? This is an affront to the reputation of the human race! Not to mention that our enemy is Wyvern, even if it was a sea god’s lineage like the Roaring Conch, we still can’t do such a thing! This is the epitome of humiliation that will stop us from ever raising our heads again!”</p>
<p>“Yes, why can’t we resist their oppression?!” These excellent disciples chimed in: “Our lake is not weaker than Wyvern, so we might as well go all out against them. As one of the three great human powers in Heaven Spirit, if we surrender even though we have the ability to fight, we’ll live a life subservient to the sea demons from this day onward…”</p>
<p>One more disciple angrily exclaimed: “The ancestors are taking things too far this time. Even human vagabonds have more backbone than this. Why should we, a great power, kneel and lick our enemies’ boots?! At worst, we’ll fight to the death so that they can see our determination!”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu sighed and cast a glance at Li Qiye to ask: “Young Noble, what should we do now?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye said: “Go to the meeting chamber. Summon all the ancestors, protectors, elders, and supervisors of the lake.”</p>
<p>“Okay, we’ll go to the chamber.” Hong Tianzhu firmly made his decision. For him right now, this was inevitable. There was no path of return, so he might as well risk it all for the lake’s final chance.</p>
<p>The meeting chamber was used for deliberations and meetings for the lake. Many of their past decisions were negotiated and decided here.</p>
<p>Later on as the competition for power intensified, the chamber was used less and less often. The ancestors rather negotiated privately and made decisions by themselves instead of deliberating publically.</p>
<p>The chamber had a rustic feel, making it seem as if it was built next to Dongting Lake. One could see the entire lake while sitting in the lobby.</p>
<p>A plaque was hung in the main lobby with the phrase, “seeing clearly the downy feather of autumn”. These simple words were majestic and all-deterrenting. [1. Idiom meaning sensitive to the finest detail, omniscient, able to distinguish right and wrong with acuity.]</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu came to the main lobby, but they were immediately stopped by the disciples there.</p>
<p>“What, you want to rebel?” Hong Tianzhu’s expression darkened as he became quite oppressive. He was still the current sect master of the lake and had an important status in the minds of the disciples here.</p>
<p>The guards hesitated for a moment before answering: “Sect Master, the ancestors’ decision…”</p>
<p>“Their decision?” Tianzhu coldly uttered: “I have assumed the role of sect master and have been in charge of Dongting Lake until this very day. It is fine if the ancestors want to oust me, but tell them to come confront me in person. The elders and supervisors will transcribe everything. If I have violated the iron creeds of the lake, then I will surrender myself to the lake’s disposal. Otherwise, the ancestors need to give me an acceptable answer!”</p>
<p>The disciples hesitated for half a day, not knowing the right words to say. On one side were the ancestors and the other, Hong Tianzhu.</p>
<p>In the end, Hong Tianzhu became angry and shouted: “Go, ask your ancestors and the high ranking members to come. If everyone wants to judge me, I want them to do so in the main chamber in front of our forefathers!”</p>
<p>A disciple quickly affirmed and went to report to the upper echelons. This matter was far beyond their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The group entered the grand chamber that could accommodate more than a thousand people.</p>
<p>In the center of the chamber was a large chair. It struck an archaic chord to the spectators. What was even stranger was that there was a crow engraved in the back. The bird stood there in repose with resting eyes.</p>
<p>There were many paintings along the wall. The people portrayed were magnificent. Some were adorned in armor with long swords in their hands. Others were scholars with their feathered fans, and more were riders trying to cross mountains and rivers…</p>
<p>The paintings surrounded one particular banner with a silver fox embroidery. This fox looked incredibly realistic. Above it was the word, “Indomitable”.</p>
<p>The young disciples looked all around since they rarely came here. Meanwhile, Tianzhu mirthlessly smiled. Outside of the ceremony when he was crowned as the sect master, there were too few conferences in this place since the ancestors would rather scheme with their own groups instead of caring about the overarching picture.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stood before the big chair and glanced at the portraits. He saw the familiar faces once more, stirring some emotions and buried memories within him. Here were numerous generals that have grown old, countless soldiers that have been laid to rest.</p>
<p>The banner itself created waves inside his heart. It once represented an unquestionable prestige and an indomitable legion.</p>
<p>“Sigh, I didn’t expect my final verdict to be decided before the old forefathers.” Hong Tianzhu peered at the portraits and gave an ironic smile: “It is a bit amusing. Normally, no one comes here to worship and give tribute to the forefathers, but now, here we are.”</p>
<p>The disciples didn’t answer. They understood that the sect master had no chance of reversing the situation after the verdict was made. Once the ancestors from the clans made up their minds, even the high elders wouldn't be able to do anything about it, let alone the lower tiers.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t offer his opinion. He simply looked at the banner and stared nonchalantly at the group: “Does any of you know what this banner represents?”</p>
<p>The young ones exchanged glances. They knew very little about their older ancestors. Even though the banner was placed here, they didn’t know of its significance.</p>
<p>Tianzhu hesitated for a bit before answering with uncertainty: “I heard our ancestors brought it back from a battlefield. We had a very powerful legion once.”</p>
<p>Despite being the sect master, he still didn’t know too much about his older ancestors. In fact, ever since their clans decided to abandon the iron creeds and abolished the unions, they no longer brought up the forefathers. After all, they were the ones who chose to disobey the old laws.</p>
<p>“More than just powerful.” Li Qiye looked at the banner and flatly said: “The Indomitable Battalion of the Silver Fox Legion was renowned for being cunning with many illustrious merits. They are definitely among the top of all the famous battalions in existence! This banner represents your ancestors’ supreme prestige. Under this symbol, they fought all over the nine worlds and fought crusades against true gods and other Immortal Emperors’ legions! Even the ominous grounds couldn’t repel their advance!”</p>
<p>“They fought against imperial legions?” The youths became wide-eyed and were startled after hearing this.</p>
<p>“Yes, they fought against imperial legions.” Li Qiye nonchalantly continued: “In the distant years, one particular imperial legion considered themselves to be untouchable and provoked the supreme prestige since they thought they could fight against the Silver Fox Legion! Your ancestors personally volunteered to fight. After ten victories, they conquered the imperial city and forced the imperial cavalry to leave Heaven Spirit. In the end, even this Immortal Emperor personally admitted that the prestige of the Silver Fox was not to be provoked!”</p>
<p>“In the nine worlds, who still knows about the Indomitable Battalion and their cunning? Winning victories despite being fewer in numbers, they’re experts at lightning speed ambushes!” Li Qiye ended with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Ten victories and conquering an imperial city…” Hong Yujiao was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>In their minds, Immortal Emperors were invincible. Meanwhile, their legions were an extension of their peerless will. Wherever they went, they would sweep through in an unbeatable manner.</p>
<p>But today, they found out that their old ancestors had once defeated an imperial legion!</p>
<p>Just imagining the style and indomitable spirit of their ancestors roused them with heroism and pride. They could envision the scene of their ancestors riding their cavalries through the majestic lands! They never knew of this prestige and glory that belonged to their ancestors who once deterred the nine heavens and ten earths!</p>

<h4>Chapter 1271: Forced Abdication</h4>
<p>Chapter 1271: Forced Abdication</p>
<p>With the banner before him, Li Qiye spoke forlornly: “An imperial legion was nothing. They were mercilessly killed after provoking the supreme prestige!”</p>
<p>Back in those years, the Zhang, Hong, Xu, and Lin ancestors decided to retire from the Indomitable Battalion, so he personally gave them this banner. Their descendants were allowed to hold onto this banner, the symbol of his will!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after they passed away, their offspring declined one generation after another. This banner was never again raised in Heaven Spirit, it was just left in this corner as a rotting piece of tribute.</p>
<p>The youths felt their blood churn while clenching their fists. They wondered when their lake would be able to relive their old might and glory.</p>
<p>“What a shame, this banner can’t shake Heaven Spirit with its gallant dance on the battlefield anymore.” Li Qiye gently sighed.</p>
<p>Hong Yujiao’s group became dejected as well after comparing the old prestige to the dysfunctional power grabbing situation in the present.</p>
<p>“One day, our ancestors’ war banner will flutter again!” Hong Yujiao clenched her fist after making this claim.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t say anything. He slowly sat down on the big chair in the middle, situated higher than the rest of the chamber.</p>
<p>For some odd reason, the others didn’t feel that this was out of place at all. It seemed as if the chair was created just for him. Him sitting there was a natural occurrence.</p>
<p>“Squeak.” At this time, the door to the chamber was opened. Some elders walked in, followed by protectors and supervisors.</p>
<p>After entering, this group darted their eyes at Hong Tianzhu and then Li Qiye, who was sitting in the main chair. They quickly exchanged glances.</p>
<p>They went and sat down in their own seats. One elder looked at Tianzhu and spoke after a short contemplation: “Sect Master, why have you dragged an outsider to this place?”</p>
<p>“Drag?” Tianzhu took a deep breath and coldly answered: “Even if Young Noble Li is an outsider, what about Yujiao and the others? How did the ancestors treat them? Their most important life decision was decided in secrecy. It is one thing to betroth them to humans, but why are we sending off our most excellent bloodlines to be used as incubators for the sea demons!”</p>
<p>“Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village have always harbored malicious intentions towards us. They are hungry tigers and bloodthirsty sharks that prowl our lake. Sooner or later, they will try to divide us. Marrying our own blood to them is simply inviting wolves to our home!” Hong Tianzhu harshly scolded the elders and the others.</p>
<p>For him, today was the day that he would break all pretenses with them. He abandoned caution and chose to go all out, even if the situation was unfavorable!</p>
<p>“Everything in Dongting is decided by us old men. We have our own reasons.” A cold voice sounded at this time.</p>
<p>Powerful auras came in one by one; gray-haired old men filed inside. Despite their old age, their eyes flashed with shudder-inducing glints.</p>
<p>The lower-tiered members didn’t dare to say anything after these old men arrived since they were only juniors in the hierarchy. The old men were all ancestors of the lake from the great clans, aside from the Zhang who had left in the past.</p>
<p>The ancestors here were at the paragon level. Their power was enough to suppress all the juniors here, so they had complete control of Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>Because of this, even if the juniors disagreed with them, there was nothing they could do to resist.</p>
<p>The ancestors’ flashing gazes swept by the crowd. When they saw Li Qiye in the high chair, they scowled. One of them coldly said: “It is good that you are here!”</p>
<p>They knew who Li Qiye was without a doubt.</p>
<p>“Tianzhu, since you want a trial, we shall give you a trial!” A Xu Ancestor began: “You colluded with an outsider and indiscriminately killed the innocent, leading to creating powerful enemies for our lake and causing a great disaster for us all. On the basis of these crimes, we hereby remove you from your position as the sect master!”</p>
<p>Tianzhu powerfully retorted against these accusations: “Ancestor, even if we assume that I am colluding with an outsider, at the very least, he is still a human! Ancestors, ask yourselves, are you not inviting wolves to our home? Against the wishes of your own disciples, you all chose to betroth them to the sea demons, our most excellent bloodlines at that! What kind of crime is this compared to mine?!”</p>
<p>“Ancestors, it is better to be direct and frank from the start, so I’ll speak.” Hong Tianzhu sneered: “The disciples of the lake aren’t properties of the clans. They are the resources of our lake. Each of them belongs to the lake, not any individual clan! They follow the laws of the lake and not the will of any ancestor who wants to influence the fate of the lake!”</p>
<p>“I am not the one violating the iron creeds of our lake, it is all of you ancestors!” He continued on: “So the first to be removed from your positions should be you, not me.”</p>
<p>“If the lake wants to oust me, fine, I have no problems with this. As long as everyone follows our creeds, remove the ancestors first, then remove me as well!” Tianzhu had decisively and completely sided against the ancestors since he had made up his mind prior to this.</p>
<p>An ancestor shouted: “How impudent, you unfilial brat!”</p>
<p>“Tianzhu, you have crossed the line.” Even an ancestor of the Hong Clan deepened his tone: “Marrying Yujiao to Wyvern is for the sake of an alliance. Is there a better union than this? It will give us another ally.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu responded with a deep breath: “Ancestor, you are my senior, so I should respect you. However, what you have done in this matter leaves the hearts of myself and that of our disciples cold! Don’t be bringing up the lake with such cliche excuses. If you want to berate me, then take out the agreements that you have with Wyvern and Shangguan Feiyan. Show it to all of us disciples.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu gazed at his own clan’s ancestor and said: “Ancestor, don’t think that I don’t know about your selfish motives for these unions! Don’t tell me that you ancestors didn’t ask for longevity pills from the Roaring Conch with Feiyan as the middleman.”</p>
<p>“This so-called union for allies is only a guise for your own sake, for the pills from the Roaring Conch! In order to live longer, you don’t give a damn about the lives of your disciples! They are only objects to trade, mere cattle in your eyes!”</p>
<p>The Hong ancestor’s embarrassment turned into fury as he cried out: “Enough, Tianzhu, this is not only disrespectful, you are also betraying your ancestors! It is a capital offense!”</p>
<p>“I agree that I am being disrespectful, but as for betrayal? I, Hong Tianzhu, can use my true fate to swear that if I am betraying my ancestors, lightning shall condemn me to eternal damnation!” Tianzhu angrily shouted back: “There, now, dear ancestors, do you all dare to pat your chests proudly and swear that you haven’t betrayed your ancestors? Who are the ones who have abandoned our laws and creeds?! Who betrayed the ancestral teachings?! I was not the one to do so, take a moment to reflect on who the real traitors are!”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s rage was at its limit. He had thoroughly lost all vestiges of faith in these ancestors after he found out that they wanted to hand him over to Wyvern. They were only working for their own benefits with wanton regard for the lives of their disciples!</p>
<p>Several ancestors were tongue-tied and unwilling to face this topic. Meanwhile, the elders, protectors, and supervisors didn’t dare to interject.</p>
<p>“Tianzhu, as long as you recognize your mistakes and apologize to us and ask for forgiveness from Wyvern and Bloodshark Village, I’m certain they will forgive your misdeeds.” An even older ancestor from the Hong Clan with a higher position spoke austerely.</p>
<p>“Ask for forgiveness?” Tianzhu snorted: “Ancestors, I’m already standing here today, there is no chance I would beg the enemies for mercy! I can accept being tried and admit my mistakes and incompetence to the old forefathers, but don’t even think about making me apologize to the enemies!”</p>
<p>“I was born in Dongting Lake and I shall die a ghost in Dongting Lake. Behead me if I was wrong, I shall die without uttering a single complaint! But if you ancestors must act so servile towards those two powers, then go ahead, take my head and hand it to them!”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1272: Drawn Swords and Bent Bows</h4>
<p>Chapter 1272: Drawn Swords and Bent Bows</p>
<p>His speech silenced the entire chamber. None of the members here wanted to talk.</p>
<p>As for the ancestors themselves, they didn’t think Tianzhu would suddenly act so tough and openly revolt against them by challenging their authority.</p>
<p>“You traitorous disciple, daring to bluster like this!” A Lin Ancestor shouted: “Go, tie this traitor up and punish him.”</p>
<p>No one moved after this command came out. All the elders, protectors, and supervisors remained still.</p>
<p>“First Elder, what are you waiting for, go capture this traitor.” The ancestor raised his voice.</p>
<p>Among the section for elders, one elder looked at the Lin Ancestor and Tianzhu before answering with apprehension: “Ancestor… about this…”</p>
<p>In fact, no one wanted to take action in this matter. Capturing Hong Tianzhu was one thing, but handing his head over to Wyvern was something no one wanted to do.</p>
<p>Not to mention that cutting off the head of their sect master and giving it to their enemies was an act that would cause their lake to never be able to lift its head again, none of the members here wanted to bear this infamy.</p>
<p>Whoever cut off Tianzhu’s head would be recorded in the annals of history. Strictly speaking, Tianzhu didn’t quite violate any laws from the lake. Under such circumstances, the one who decapitates him would be remembered and reviled by the future generations for an eternity.</p>
<p>Thus, who would be willing to carry out the order of these ancestors? The members here weren’t fools. The ancestors were willing to kill Tianzhu for their own gains — this meant that no matter who became the next sect master, their head could fall if they went against the interests of the ancestors in the future as well.</p>
<p>These ancestors were in control at this moment, so they used the lake’s resources as their own. The members needed someone who could contain the ancestors so that they wouldn’t be able to do as they please, so that they can’t sacrifice the lake for personal gain.</p>
<p>Tianzhu’s upheaval was a good beginning. If he could accomplish his goals today, then the juniors from the lake could stop the ancestors from their dictatorial nature later on.</p>
<p>However, if Tianzhu were to be killed today, the lake would completely belong to the ancestors and they would become mere pawns. The regulations and laws of the lake wouldn't be able to stop these ancestors any longer.</p>
<p>“All of you want to rebel as well?” The Lin Ancestor shouted after seeing the First Elder staying still.</p>
<p>Li Qiye commented out of nowhere at this time: “At least Dongting Lake can still be saved with some people who can see the big picture. They understand that the lake doesn’t belong to you.”</p>
<p>The Lin Ancestor furiously shouted: “Shut up, junior, we’ll deal with you in a second—”</p>
<p>In a flash, Li Qiye disappeared. Before the ancestor could finish his words, he was sent flying from Li Qiye’s punch while spurting blood. He didn’t even have the chance to stand before Li Qiye had him by the neck.</p>
<p>“Junior, don’t be crazy!” A different ancestor from the Lin Clan instantly stood up and screamed, but he didn’t dare to do anything while his peer was in Li Qiye’s grasp.</p>
<p>The ancestor in his clasp cried out: “Junior, if you, you even dare to hurt half a hair of mine, don’t even think about leaving the lake alive.”</p>
<p>“I could have spared your life out of consideration for your ancestors. Unfortunately, you are too stupid.” Li Qiye glared at this ancestor.</p>
<p>“Crack!” He easily crushed his neck then threw the corpse to the side like trash.</p>
<p>All this happened incredibly quickly. The other ancestors could only watch the death of their fellow ancestor.</p>
<p>When their minds returned, Li Qiye was already back in the high chair. In an instant, all the ancestors from the clans surrounded him.</p>
<p>A Hong ancestor sternly stated: “Junior, you think you can do whatever you want just because we want to capture you alive?”</p>
<p>A Xu ancestor exclaimed: “Capture and hand him over to Miss Shangguan!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye glared at these ancestors and spoke with contempt: “Just a bunch of Virtuous Paragons, yet you dare to bluster in front of me? Are you all too stupid to gather information? Shangguan Feiyan is a God-Monarch, yet I took her down with one fist. What can any of you do?”</p>
<p>The ancestors shuddered after hearing this. They exchanged glances and immediately took out their best weapons. The group was still eager to try with an imposing momentum.</p>
<p>A Lin ancestor retorted: “Junior, even if you are powerful, don’t forget that this is Dongting Lake. Since you’re here, don’t even think about leaving.”</p>
<p>They weren’t willing to back down at this moment since their lake still had an ace up its sleeve. Their great formation was still dormant; once they activated it, they would be able to trap a powerful God-Monarch like Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye coldly declared: “If you had half this courage when facing the enemies outside, your Dongting Lake wouldn’t have been reduced to this pathetic state of bending over and scraping for favors. Only a bunch of idiots who can only bully their own nest. Very well, I will massacre all of you today and eradicate your ancestors’ unfilial descendants in their stead.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s heart skipped a beat after hearing this. He quickly interjected: “Young Noble Li, please show mercy.”</p>
<p>Even though he was going against the ancestors, he never thought about killing all of them. After all, they were still his seniors. It would be a huge sin if he was part of the reason why they were all killed.</p>
<p>Li Qiye dismissively countered: “They’re just a group of fools, leaving them behind will only cause more trouble for the lake.” His eyes revealed a murderous glint.</p>
<p>The ancestors’ hearts jumped after seeing the terrifying murderous glint in Li Qiye’s eyes. They received a wake-up call of just who they were dealing with and immediately cried: “We beseech the Virtuous Ancestors.”</p>
<p>“Such arrogant words!” A heartless voice emerged. It had a hint of stateliness that prevented others from resisting.</p>
<p>At this time, four old men were carried inside. They were sitting on big chairs with tiger fur linings. They were extremely hoary and gave off the feeling of death. Their eyes were half closed; it was as if the moment they closed them completely, they would bid farewell to this world.</p>
<p>Moreover, their blood energies were essentially non-existent. Nevertheless, their half-closed eyes still emitted flashes as sharp as swords capable of tearing through all things.</p>
<p>“Virtuous Ancestors!” Hong Tianzhu was completely shocked after seeing the four ancestors and had to take a step back to calm himself. The other members were astonished as well and bowed their heads.</p>
<p>These four were the strongest ancestors that currently presided over Dongting Lake and had been living reclusively. They were also the ones behind the old reformation that abandoned the old creeds and unions. In the end, they forced the Zhang Clan away and divided all the properties of the lake.</p>
<p>Even though they rarely showed themselves, the direction of the lake was entirely under their control. All of the ancestors here were either their disciples or direct descendants. It could even be said that in order to prolong their lives, they kept a vast amount of resources from the lake for themselves.</p>
<p>The ancestors made way for the four old men. They quickly formed a formation to surround Li Qiye.</p>
<p>At this moment, no one dared to say anything. The elders and protectors dared to challenge the other ancestors, but they lost their courage in front of these four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
<p>Some of the elders who were privy to past information were even more fearful of these four ancestors. They were aware of the four’s cruelty. Any disobedience would result in either banishment or house arrest. Nothing good would come from opposing them.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s face paled; he secretly winked at Li Qiye to let him know how bad the situation had become.</p>
<p>“First, capture that traitor Tianzhu.” The four ancestors didn’t bother glancing at Tianzhu. They had absolute power and controlled the life and death of the lake’s disciples.</p>
<p>A younger ancestor immediately came closer to capture him. At this time, Hong Tianzhu could only stand there with an austere demeanor. He knew that resistance would be futile due to his lack of strength.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1273: Spirits Of The Ancestors</h4>
<p>Chapter 1273: Spirits Of The Ancestors</p>
<p>An ancestor shouted at Hong Tianzhu: “Traitor, surrender now!”</p>
<p>Tianzhu instinctively stumbled back and shouted as well: “Young Noble Li, go!” He became desperate the moment the four Virtuous Ancestors showed up. There were no chips he could use to bargain against them.</p>
<p>“Get down!” Li Qiye’s eyes focused as he chanted an oppressive mantra.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The ancestor that wanted to capture Tianzhu lost control of his body. He was struck by Li Qiye’s spell and was forced several steps back.</p>
<p>The four Virtuous Ancestors turned serious after seeing the mantra Li Qiye chanted. They immediately opened their eyes completely. The sharpness of their vision painfully scraped others’ skin.</p>
<p>“Junior, you are indeed strong.” One of them coldly uttered: “But you are wrong about one thing. Our Dongting Lake might be willing to negotiate for peace with others, but this does not mean we are weak!”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Li Qiye chuckled: “You want to use Wyvern to suck up to the Roaring Conch like a dog in order to obtain longevity pills from them. This is throwing away all the face of your ancestors, no, you descendants are spitting on your ancestors’ faces.”</p>
<p>“Little animal, you can keep running your mouth.” A different ancestor sneered: “We’ll sever your limbs and muscles before handing you over to Miss Shangguan.”</p>
<p>With that, all four took out their weapons. Their expressions became quite solemn and ruthless afterward.</p>
<p>These four weapons were quite old; their spots and scars spoke volumes of the many battles they had seen. The ancestor’s battle intents surged with the appearance of the weapons, like a battle horn riling up the mighty cavalry.</p>
<p>In a short amount of time, a ferocious bloodthirst filled the entire chamber like a true dragon entering the sea, a thirsty tiger leaving the mountain or a direwolf leaving its cage. The four weapons’ will to kill was unstoppable. They could destroy everything standing in their way!</p>
<p>“The forefathers’ weapons.” The members here were dazed at the sight of these ancient weapons and retreated. There was a sense of reverence in their eyes.</p>
<p>“Junior, accept your defeat.” The four ancestors revealed menacing smiles. They shouted at the same time and attacked with their weapons. It was the start of a great formation!</p>
<p>They had confidence that the moment this formation was formed, they could even stop a Godking, let alone a young junior.</p>
<p>“Whoosh!” However, before the four weapons could suppress Li Qiye, he slammed both hands down on his chair and an order writ came flying towards the banner on the wall. The fox on it seemed to be coming back to life.</p>
<p>In this split second, the four weapons continued to fly towards Li Qiye, but not to attack him. They jumped to him as if they had just seen a family member.</p>
<p>An incredible thing happened. The weapons floated above his head in a very happy manner, like singing skylarks.</p>
<p>The four ancestors were aghast before this scene. These weapons had always been in their possession. After abandoning the iron creeds, they had gained full control of the weapons until today.</p>
<p>“Return!” The four recalled the weapons in unison. However, there was no reaction. The weapons continued to float above Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Start!” The four didn’t give up and didn’t mind using their own longevity blood to amplify their summons. Alas, it was still useless.</p>
<p>“Impossible!” This spectacle left everyone speechless. Their lake’s weapons were being controlled by an outsider. However, how could they possibly know that these weapons were personally created by Li Qiye who then handed them down to the forefathers of the Hong, Zhang, Xu and Lin Clans? Who in this world could understand these weapons more than their own creator?</p>
<p>“The four weapons of the Indomitable Battalion belong to everyone, they’re not the personal properties of you fools.” Li Qiye coldly uttered: “Your foolishness has ruined your ancestors’ prestige and glory. Today, on their behalf, I sentence you to death!”</p>
<p>While issuing large explosions, the four weapons immediately attacked the four Virtuous Ancestors; all of them were aghast. They took out their own strongest weapons in order to resist the assault.</p>
<p>“Boom!” Another loud blast resounded. The four ancestors were forced to take several steps back. They were indeed powerful and stopped one attack from these ancient weapons.</p>
<p>Li Qiye shouted: “Where are my generals of the Indomitable Battalion?!” At this time, the crow on the back of the seat suddenly came back to life. It spread its wings and covered Li Qiye completely while flying above him.</p>
<p>This was initially a carved image of a crow, but it suddenly came back to life. It poured down one holy, untouchable law after another.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The part of the lake that faced the chamber had bubbles and waves everywhere. Four sturdy figures emerged from the lake.</p>
<p>These four came into the chamber. They were made from the lake water, so they were sparkling and translucent.</p>
<p>The crowd became astonished the moment they saw the faces of these figures made from water. One person glanced at the portraits along the wall and screamed: “Ancestors!”</p>
<p>Though there were many portraits on the walls, the paintings of these four were bigger than the others. Without a doubt, their status was much higher as well.</p>
<p>At this time, the members here found four particular portraits that matched these figures. They were the first forefathers of the Lin, Zhang, Xu, and Hong Clans!</p>
<p>“Our ancestors’ spirits!” Hong Tianzhu shouted while recalling what Li Qiye had said before. He quickly prostrated on the ground, bowing his head.</p>
<p>This scene was too shocking. Their oldest forefathers suddenly appeared in spiritual form. All the ancestors and lower-ranking members were scared out of their minds. They never thought that such a day would come.</p>
<p>“Ancestors…” After seeing Tianzhu kneeling on the ground, the other elders and protectors quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>“Unfilial bastards!” The four men made of water released a shout that shook the mountains and rivers. They were existences that had once swept through the world. All the ancestors here shivered in the face of the pressure they let off.</p>
<p>The four Virtuous Ancestors turned pale and turned to flee. They had abandoned the iron creeds and the union — this was a clear violation of the ancestral teachings. They had a guilty conscience, so the appearance of these spirits made their souls fly away and scatter from fear. All they wanted to do was to get the hell out of this place.</p>
<p>However, these water figures wouldn’t let them escape so easily. They casually reached out and the four weapons fell into their hands. This heralded the coming of four godly generals.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The weapons mercilessly suppressed this entire area and set off a monstrous battle aura.</p>
<p>“No…” The four Virtuous Ancestors had already lost their will to fight and couldn’t react in time. All four were swiftly suppressed by these weapons.</p>
<p>The water figures threw these suppressed ancestors down before Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stared and coldly uttered at the four Virtuous Ancestors on the ground: “The Dongting Lake of today and the Indomitable Battalion of past, what is the judgment in accordance to the iron creeds?”</p>
<p>The four water figures mercilessly replied: “Death!” At the same time, all the portals on the walls lit up. Every single one of them exuded an invincible battle aura. Ruthless laws emerged from these paintings, the symbols of their honest and incorruptible creeds within a martial order.</p>
<p>“Kneel!” Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold. The crow above his head exuded a supreme divine aura. It seemed like an eternal existence was coming back to life. This crow proceeded to glare at everyone present. At this time, Li Qiye’s words represented an untouchable will.</p>
<p>“Bang!” The four water figures kicked the ancestors, forcing them to kneel on the ground.</p>
<p>“Kneel!” Li Qiye shifted his attention towards the other ancestors from the great clans. At this time, all the elders and protectors were already prostrating while these ancestors were trembling with fear.</p>
<p>After seeing his cold glare and the iron creeds within the portraits, they didn’t dare to resist and immediately kneeled on the ground.</p>
<p>Li Qiye declared: “Abandoning the iron creeds, shattering the union, violating the ancestral teachings, what should the punishment be?”</p>
<p>“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic reverberations came about. The iron creeds within the portraits intertwined to form a tiger tally with the word “death” on top of it. [1. The two-piece tiger tallies (hu-fu, 虎符 in Chinese) were used by kings or emperors to command and dispatch their army. The right piece was retained in the central government while the left piece was issued to the local officials or commanders. If someone wanted to dispatch the troops from a certain area, he had to show the right piece of the tiger tally in order to gain authorization; both pieces of the tally had to match each other. I thought a fox tally would be more fitting in terms of the context, but a tiger is the historical symbol.]</p>
<p>The word was full of blood and instilled fear into all the spectators.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1274: Suppression</h4>
<p>Chapter 1274: Suppression</p>
<p>Everyone present trembled before the iron creeds. At this time, they understood the real meaning behind the creed. This was a real entity meant for rewards and punishments, it wasn’t just a concept.</p>
<p>“Kill.” Li Qiye mercilessly declared the fate of the four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
<p>Four water swords protruded from the water figures’ hands. They raised these swords and cut down at the same time.</p>
<p>“Pluff!” The Virtuous Ancestors’ heads fell to the ground. Blood rushed out from their necks and dyed the chamber red.</p>
<p>All the ancestors here trembled when they saw the rolling heads. Their arrogance from earlier disappeared right away. Even their Virtuous Ancestors were killed, and they were not much in comparison.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat back in his high chair and coldly swept through everyone with his piercing eyes. Everyone was now kneeling while feeling a fearful chill, Hong Tianzhu included.</p>
<p>They finally understood what a supreme authority was. This was the true suppression of the nine heavens. The moment the Dark Crow spread its wings, the entire world would be blotted out. Billions of existences would begin to tremble.</p>
<p>Li Qiye questioned them: “Before your forefathers and the iron creeds, do you confess your sins or do their spirits have to force you?”</p>
<p>The four water figures came forth emotionlessly. Even before their descendants, they were as cold and ruthless as ever. Each took over a corner with their sword raised. Even though these blades were made out of water, they were still flashing with bloodthirst. These were god-slaying weapons.</p>
<p>The ancestors here were aghast when the spirits of their ancestors blocked the four directions. They understood that if they tried to escape, these spirits would show no mercy in striking them down.</p>
<p>“I, I confess my sins.” A Hong ancestor realized that the situation was no longer salvageable. Struggling any further would be futile and suicidal, so he dropped flat to the ground and said: “I am guilty and willing to accept the punishment of the iron creed.”</p>
<p>“I, I confess as well.” With someone taking the lead, the rest of the ancestors eventually bowed on the ground, no longer daring to resist. People all valued their lives. In their eyes, a clean and honorable death was no match for a borrowed life.</p>
<p>“Very well, the capital punishment can be forgiven, but judgment must be delivered.” Li Qiye coldly uttered: “In accordance to the iron creeds, they shall be punished for their gravest sin. Their sentence shall be banishment to the detention precipice. Their lives shall be spared so that they can serve the lake in the future.”</p>
<p>“Clank, clank, clank!” Iron laws flew out from the portraits and instantly nailed themselves into the bodies of these ancestors. They then dragged these ancestors away without meeting any resistance.</p>
<p>The iron creeds were the vows of their forefathers and all the brothers in the Indomitable Battalion. These laws contained their unbendable will and heroism. To resist these iron laws was tantamount to resisting the entire battalion.</p>
<p>In the past, these newer ancestors chose to abandon the creeds. Not only did they stop passing down its teachings, they made decisions in secret instead of debating using this chamber. In the end, they didn’t have the ability to destroy the creeds themselves.</p>
<p>The lower-tier members were continuously shivering while watching their ancestors being dragged away. Even Hong Tianzhu was startled.</p>
<p>They had heard about the iron creeds in the past despite their ancestors’ unwillingness to talk about this subject. However, they thought that the creeds were only a written set of rules like the ancestral teachings. They didn’t expect it to have such power.</p>
<p>They finally realized why the Virtuous Ancestors chose to abandon the creeds and stopped debating in this grand chamber. So it turned out that these four were afraid of the creeds.</p>
<p>It all became clear now. If everything was carried out in accordance with the creeds, the clans could only carry out their own responsibilities without taking advantage of the lake. There was no way of imposing their will on the laws and direction of the lake.</p>
<p>Li Qiye coldly declared: “I don’t care how many resources and docks your clans have occupied. From today on, the iron creeds are in effect again. I will give you one year to complete this process. The violators shall be at the mercy of the creeds.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu was the first to agree to the re-implementation of their old legacy. He prostrated on the ground and quickly declared: “I shall obey the iron creeds.”</p>
<p>“We also agree.” The others quickly did the same and stated their willingness. In their eyes, even the ancestors were powerless to stop this, let alone them.</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly said: “Very well, I am here today to represent your forefathers in order to clean up this mess, but ultimately, the authority of the lake still belongs to all of you. The fate of the lake is within your grasp.”</p>
<p>The crow floating above him returned to the chair while the portraits on the wall turned still once more after the iron creeds slowly went back inside them. The four water figures also returned to the lake.</p>
<p>“We respectfully bid farewell to the ancestors.” Hong Tianzhu thought about a legend after seeing the features of these figures that were completely identical to the portraits on the wall. He bowed his head once more to the spirits.</p>
<p>“Farewell, Venerable Ancestors.” The others did the same. They understood that the spirits of their ancestors had always been within the lake.</p>
<p>“I come bearing news!” After the four water figures left, a disciple hastily rushed in. When he saw the scene within the chamber, he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>While still in his chair, Li Qiye spoke in an aloof manner: “What’s the matter, speak.”</p>
<p>A stranger sitting in the main seat of the chamber was a very strange event. However, this disciple uncontrollably answered: “Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village have declared war. They demand an answer within forty-five minutes or else they’ll begin the siege.” [1. The raw is three-quarters of an hour.]</p>
<p>Li Qiye sneered: “Naive fools. Very well, today, everyone in the Dragon Demon Sea shall open their eyes to witness the true might of Dongting Lake!”</p>
<p>“With the exception of the elders and protectors who need to maintain their posts, everyone else follow me. It is time for all of you to see the invincible prestige of your ancestors, their style as they swept through the nine worlds. Be ready to engrave it in your minds.” With that, he stood up and went outside.</p>
<p>Outside of those who had to return to their posts, the rest followed Li Qiye outside. The great armies of Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were surrounding the lake. They had made preparations to attack with both the village master and the King of Wyvern boosting their morale. They awaited the order to attack.</p>
<p>The disciples from the lake guarding the checkpoints were quite nervous. They didn’t know whether the lake could withstand this looming disaster. Many great powers and cultivators from all over the seas eagerly watched. Some just wanted to have some fun while others aimed to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Shangguan Feiyan rose to the sky and declared: “Forty-five minutes have passed. Elders, if you don’t give us a reply, don’t blame us for attacking your lake.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a response right now.” A dismissive voice came about. Someone was floating above the lake’s sky with Hong Tianzhu’s group right behind them.</p>
<p>“Li Qiye!” Shangguan Feiyan immediately became aggressive. Her eyes turned red upon seeing her enemy again!</p>
<p>“It’s Li Qiye.” The others watching from the horizon were surprised to see Hong Tianzhu together with Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Shangguan Feiyan angrily blurted: “Li, you actually dared to linger here?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled in response: “Why not? You think you are a threat to me? You’re just a loser who lost to me before.”</p>
<p>“You!” Feiyan had no retort to this nonchalant statement. Meanwhile, the others exchanged glances. Even though some thought that she lost due to her own carelessness, this was an irrefutable truth.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and said: “Li, someone else will take care of you. I am talking to the lake right now.”</p>
<p>With that, she shifted her gaze towards Hong Tianzhu and coldly said: “Hong Tianzhu, where are your ancestors? They have agreed to hand Li Qiye over, this is the condition for surrender.”</p>
<p>So it turned out that the ancestors from the lake had already finished negotiating with Feiyan on the conditions of surrender the moment she gathered her troops here.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1275: Bloodshark Sovereign</h4>
<p>Chapter 1275: Bloodshark Sovereign</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu was unperturbed while standing behind Li Qiye. He flatly replied: “Miss Shangguan, Young Noble Li is our lake’s plenipotentiary. If you wish to talk, you can talk with him.”</p>
<p>“A plenipotentiary?” Not only were the spectators surprised, even the guarding disciples of the lake were caught off guard.</p>
<p>Such a large lineage like the lake actually gave complete authority to someone this suddenly. Moreover, it was under duress. How could people not be shocked by this development?</p>
<p>The disciples from the lake didn’t even know who Li Qiye was, let alone understand him.</p>
<p>Feiyan’s expression changed after hearing this as well. She didn’t expect this reversal.</p>
<p>She coldly uttered: “Tianzhu, you should think twice. This is an existential crisis for your Dongting Lake!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled in response before Tianzhu could answer: “There’s no need to waste time. Didn’t you want to talk? Go ahead, I am a very open-minded person. Say what you want.”</p>
<p>Judging from the lack of response from Tianzhu and the other elders, Feiyan knew that the lake was on Li Qiye’s side.</p>
<p>In spite of this, she still thought that she had a strong card up her sleeve, so she was full of confidence: “Li Qiye, if you want to save the lake, first kneel and confess your sins, I will be the judge. Second, the lake must hand over fifty female disciples with excellent bloodlines to become our incubators. Third, Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village will station troops at the lake. Only when these three conditions are satisfied will we withdraw our troops.”</p>
<p>A disciple blurted out: “Bullshit!” No one with a sliver of pride would ever accept such conditions.</p>
<p>This was a great humiliation to their lake. If they were to agree to these demands, they would never be able to lift their heads up again. This was an indelible shame.</p>
<p>The cultivators nearby secretly shook their heads. These conditions were too outrageous. No lineage would agree to them.</p>
<p>“And if we refuse?” Li Qiye didn’t become angry. Instead, he gently smiled.</p>
<p>Feiyan’s eyes turned serious, just like her tone: “If you refuse, well, it won’t be up to you. We’ll capture you and flay your skin before ripping out your tendons! As for the lake, we will trample it, kill all the men and enslave the women!”</p>
<p>This remark definitely didn’t win over the disciples from the lake. They became even more furious.</p>
<p>A disciple angrily shouted: “We’ll fight to the end!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Fight to the end!” Many echoed the sentiment with blaring roars towards Feiyan.</p>
<p>Li Qiye remained calm and faintly smiled: “Do you want to hear my opinion? It is very simple, you will be the one to kneel and present your head as an apology. Second, all the disciples from Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village must surrender to my whim. If you can agree to this, then I will only kill your ancestors and elders while sparing the others. If not, then it will be even simpler. I shall massacre Wyvern and the village and trample through your ancestral grounds, turning everything to ashes. Your lineages shall be no more in the Dragon Demon Sea from tomorrow onward.”</p>
<p>Such outrageous words shocked everyone present. One person among the spectators commented: “That’s an incredible response.”</p>
<p>Gongsun Meiyu's death had shown everyone that Li Qiye was strong, but it was a bit ridiculous to declare the destruction of two great powers.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister, give the order, let us kill this little animal!” The disciples from wyvern were enraged and primed to fight.</p>
<p>Feiyan’s expression was as cold as ice as she replied: “You’ll defeat us with just your empty words?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Li Qiye dismissively said: “A loser like you isn’t qualified to negotiate with me.”</p>
<p>This repetitive retort left her face red. It was too great of a blow to her; the only way she could erase this disgrace was to kill him.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, such blustering. I have traveled across the four seas, yet I still haven’t heard of someone declare that they would destroy my Bloodshark Village.” While Feiyan had yet to respond, a gloomy voice came about instead.</p>
<p>In this great army of one hundred thousand soldiers, an old man was being carried out. He was seated on a great throne and had an imperious temperament.</p>
<p>People finally noticed his great stature when he slowly stood up. They felt much smaller after seeing his full size.</p>
<p>However, his physical prowess was not the only reason why others felt insignificant before him. He exuded a divine aura that made him seem as if he was untouchable, like a god overlooking all creation.</p>
<p>An old paragon recognized his identity and shouted: “Bloodshark Sovereign!”</p>
<p>“Bloodshark Sovereign!” Even the younger ones who had never seen him before had heard of his fame. They became quite frightened due to his notoriety.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu’s group took a step back in astonishment.</p>
<p>“He is a heaven-defying expert that had the chance to become a sea god back then.” Older paragons stared at him in awe.</p>
<p>This was a preeminent character during the last generation, someoneaccepted by the Trident. His fame was at an all-time high during that period because everyone in Heaven Spirit assumed that he would be the next sea god.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the Trident left him later on and accepted a different sea demon as its master. That sea demon later became the Lithodidae Sea God!</p>
<p>Despite being abandoned, the sovereign still reached the top to become one of the most powerful demons of his time.</p>
<p>Today, his personal arrival left everyone gasping. They understood now that Wyvern and the village had no intentions of peacefully resolving the issue with the lake. Its destruction was their primary goal.</p>
<p>Some sea demons became quite excited and muttered: “I’m afraid the lake will become ashes the moment the sovereign takes action.”</p>
<p>“Feiyan is quite influential, to actually be able to tempt even the sovereign.” Some now realized why Feiyan was this confident. With a hidden card like the sovereign, victory was certain.</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned tense to the extreme. The lake’s disciples went pale after seeing the famous sovereign. Despair reared its ugly head in their hearts since their lake was facing probable destruction.</p>
<p>Outside of the battlefield on the distant horizon, many powerful charming spirit ancestors watched everything play out. In this region, charming spirits didn’t want to mingle with sea demons, especially those at the ancestor level.</p>
<p>This ancestor from an ancient lineage with astral eyes murmured: “That devil Bloodshark wants to take action, I wonder if the lake’s real power is still there or not.”</p>
<p>A disciple next to him curiously asked: “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>In the eyes of many youths and even the previous generation cultivators, Dongting Lake could be considered a great power, but it couldn’t compare to actual first-rate sects.</p>
<p>“It is an ancient legend that I have only heard of.” The ancestor explained: “The tales speak of the lake’s incredible ancestors that once contributed to an invincible legion. Our own ancestors have said that their ancestors left behind an incomparable protection for their descendants.”</p>
<p>This was the first time this junior had heard of this legend, so he skeptically replied: “Really?”</p>
<p>“Most likely.” The ancestor continued: “The lake is a coveted treasure ground. If they didn’t have this protection, others would have destroyed it already, there wouldn’t be any need to wait till today.”</p>
<p>Back on the battlefield, the atmosphere was quite solemn. The disciples from the lake all felt a cold chill and thought that they wouldn’t be able to escape this disaster.</p>
<p>“Haha, it seems like disappearing for a single generation has made the youths much more arrogant.” The sovereign coldly stared at Li Qiye: “You must be tired of living to bluster about destroying my village when I am still around.”</p>
<p>No one found his words unreasonable due to his established prestige.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1276: Indomitable Battalion</h4>
<p>Chapter 1276: Indomitable Battalion</p>
<p>The fearful crowd didn’t dare to oppose the burly Bloodshark Sovereign. Even though he failed to become a sea god, he was still frightening all the same.</p>
<p>“Just a fake god, yet you still dare to spout your nonsense here?” Li Qiye nonchalantly cast a glance at the sovereign: “Not to mention a pretender like you, even if a true god came, I would still nail him to death.”</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned after hearing this. God-slaying was what came out of Li Qiye’s mouth. Perhaps in the entire world, no one would be able to do this, let alone someone from the younger generation.</p>
<p>The Bloodshark Sovereign’s expression soured. As a very powerful sea demon, the world had always been respectful to him even before he came out. But now, when his true body was here, a junior showing such public disdain left him without any face.</p>
<p>“Naive fool.” He turned scarily stern while a murderous bloodthirst surged from his glare like two great rivers of stars. It made the whole region tremble.</p>
<p>Living beings shuddered before his current mood. His chilling voice echoed across the world: “Today, I shall cut you down and crush this lake. From today on, Dongting Lake will be no more.”</p>
<p>“Boom!” A boundless vitality gushed out of his body. It engulfed the entire Dragon Demon Sea. What truly made others shiver was that an endless sea of blood appeared behind him. A terrifyingly gigantic shark was swimming in this sea. It created waves that towered for ten thousand miles and its enormous jaws seemed capable of swallowing the lake whole.</p>
<p>“So powerful, this is the Bloodshark Village’s totem!” Many people trembled after seeing this. A powerful lineage was about to be swallowed by this gigantic bloodshark.</p>
<p>Feiyan revealed a sinister smile after seeing the sovereign’s might. She sneered: “Li Qiye, doomsday is here for you. Even if you were a True Monarch or a Bestowed Monarch, you are powerless!”</p>
<p>“Ignorant child, kneel and accept your death, or do I have to personally refine you?” The sovereign looked down on the world and its inhabitants. He carried a style as if he could annihilate this world.</p>
<p>“I think only a Godking’s actual presence would be able to stop him.” An old paragon felt dread and said: “Li Qiye needs to be much stronger than a Bestowed Monarch.”</p>
<p>“Just a fake god yet you dare to bark in front of me?” Li Qiye snorted: “There’s no need for me to personally slay an ant. Today, you shall open your dog eyes wide, and the same goes for all the sea demons here. Those who dare to act presumptuously before Dongting Lake shall be killed mercilessly!”</p>
<p>Everyone was astounded after hearing this. Many sea demons angrily glared at him for this verbal provocation.</p>
<p>Even the humans in the distance felt that he was being too arrogant. This was akin to challenging all the sea demons in the region — a very unwise decision.</p>
<p>At this time, he shouted: “Banner, heed my call!” With a crashing sound, the banner that had been hanging in the middle of the lake’s chamber immediately rushed into the sky.</p>
<p>“Clank!” It pinned itself into the sky, using the heaven and earth as its pole. Nothing could shake it.</p>
<p>“Whoosh!” The banner swept through the world. While fluttering in the wind, the silver fox embroidery came back to life. The fox’s tail seemed to come out as it entrenched itself in the physical realm. The gods all quaked with its coming.</p>
<p>It was a silver fox with ferocious bloodthirst. Its appearance instilled shivers in everyone, no matter if they were gods or deities.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chanted: “Where is my Indomitable Battalion?!” The banner continued to dance with his call.</p>
<p>Roars resounded. This was the resonating horn of war.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The lake water suddenly turned into a tsunami. It assaulted the sky and caused the stars to shake!</p>
<p>When this tsunami disappeared, a battalion appeared in the sky. It was arranged in a rectangular formation with four calvaries stationed in each corner. Each cavalry had one commanding general.</p>
<p>The whole world was enveloped in a harsh and somber aura. Every soldier in this battalion was formed from water. Nevertheless, people could still smell the stench of blood wafting from them.</p>
<p>It was as if each warrior from this regiment had bathed in blood. They had arrived after walking through the bones of their enemies and had experienced countless battlefields.</p>
<p>These battle-hardened troops were full of death, blood, and ruthlessness. Their motto was a single word: “Indomitable”!</p>
<p>“The Indomitable Battalion of the Silver Fox Legion has finally come out.” Jian Longwei, watching from afar, was dazed.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stood under the banner while belittling the world. He coldly glared at the crowd and said: “All existences in the Dragon Demon Sea, open your eyes. From today on, those who dare to provoke Dongting Lake will only meet death!”</p>
<p>The sovereign shouted: “Junior, I’ll kill you first!” His bloody tide engulfed the sky while the giant shark swam forward. Such an attack could shatter millions of miles of land and crush any helpless cultivator into a pulp.</p>
<p>However, with the fluttering of the banner and the protection of the silver fox, his attack was stopped completely; it was unable to harm Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye glared at the sovereign and commanded: “Slay them, slay them all!”</p>
<p>“Kill!” The war horn blared again. The four generals led their troops and instantly attacked without any hesitation. They rushed with great speed towards the grand army from Wyvern and the village.</p>
<p>Feiyan shouted her order: “Face them!”</p>
<p>“In formation!” The great army frenziedly screamed in unison: “Kill them!”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, they shifted their position to form two great formations. One turned into a gigantic dragon and the other a shark covered in blood. The dragon was thousands of miles long while the shark could devour the heavens. It was a frightening spectacle.</p>
<p>This army had the absolute advantage when it came to numbers! The dragon-shaped formation immediately coiled around the attacking cavalries in order to take advantage of their numbers. Meanwhile, the bloodshark opened its mouth in order to take a bite out of the approaching enemies.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!” However, these battle formations were useless before the Indomitable Battalion. This elite force quickly shattered their formations. Both the dragon and shark instantly disappeared. The regular army was again exposed before the cavalries.</p>
<p>“Rumble!” The Indomitable Battalion mounted their offense like a raging storm and trampled over the opposing army.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!” Screams continuously sounded left and right. The Indomitable Battalion harvested skulls as if they were harvesting wheat. Heads went flying as enemies fell to the ground with blood gushing from their corpses. The rain of red painted over the sky.</p>
<p>In almost no time at all, the 100,000 strong army was sent into disarray. Even though the battalion was few in number, they were no different from a flood of steel. The other army wanted to counter-attack, but their defense and momentum had been shattered upon impact in the face of the hooves of the battalion.</p>
<p>These calvaries had experienced countless wars, so they were practically unstoppable. An army of this level was simply no match for them. Only imperial legions were worthy of being their opponents, not babies like these!</p>
<p>The screaming continued without pause during this massacre. Eventually, the army collapsed completely. Many disciples wanted to run, but they didn’t get far before being met with the scythes of these gods of death. Their heads rolled on the ground while they watched blood spurt from their severed necks.</p>
<p>The disparity in strength was enormous. It was not an even battle at all! During this slaughter, some soldiers in the army didn’t even realize that they had lost before being decapitated.</p>
<p>Mournful cries resounded through the heaven and earth. The King of Wyvern was killed by a general. This general raised Wyvern’s king’s body up high with his lance. Blood slowly dripped down from the corpse.</p>
<p>Feiyan saw her father being crucified up high and let out a sharp howl: “No!!!”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1277: Imitation Trident</h4>
<p>Chapter 1277: Imitation Trident</p>
<p>An army of one hundred thousand was slaughtered in the blink of an eye. The Indomitable cavalries swept through them like the wind blowing around autumn leaves without the slightest signs of stagnation. The difference in power was far too great.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked after this scene and couldn’t regain their sanity. The battle just now was too cruel and terrorizing. This was the scariest army they had ever witnessed — completely ruthless and invincible!</p>
<p>“Among the four legions of the Dark Crow, the Tiger Legion is the most ferocious while the Silver Fox is the most crafty!” Jian Longwei exclaimed after the quick massacre: “This Indomitable Battalion is famous for being quite ruthless in the Silver Fox Legion as well as being the top elites. Zhang, Hong, Xu, and Lin… these four great generals had killed the generals under an Immortal Emperor before! How could this meager army be a match for them?”</p>
<p>“Ancestor, have you seen the Silver Fox Legion before?” Jian Xiaotie’s hair was standing on end. This was the first time he saw such a scary regiment, the first time he witnessed such a sweeping victory!</p>
<p>“No.” Jian Longwei shook his head in response: “I heard it from our progenitor. Legend states that the Silver Fox Legion is very mysterious and has followed His Excellency for a very long time. No one knows where they are, but when His Excellency requires their service, they will suddenly appear behind the enemies and destroy them within the shortest amount of time possible.”</p>
<p>Jian Xiaotie murmured: “So this is the hidden power of Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>Longwei nodded: “That’s right. According to the rumors, after the Indomitable Battalion retired and died from old age, they buried their bodies and refined their true fates into heroic spirits. They prepared a supreme formation under the lake where these spirits have been sleeping ever since. They required the nourishment from this treasure land in order to maintain their form as a spectral army.”</p>
<p>“Just think about it, Dongting Lake is part of the Dragon Mountain Range. In addition to getting the consent of the Dragon Kingdom, the important part is that they have the power to protect themselves.” Longwei gently sighed: “If they didn’t have this powerful protection, how could their current disciples possibly guard the lake? These sea demons are only a bunch of fools who think that they can take over the lake. They have forgotten about another problem. Who would dare to try and divide parts of the Dragon Mountain Range’s ancestral ground without permission from the Dragon God?”</p>
<p>Xiaotie remained quiet. Their Grandfather was named Jian Longwei not at birth, but rather through a process of bestowment. This name represented a supreme glory.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei was just like his name, he was the guardian of the Giant Dragon Kingdom!</p>
<p>After a very long time, some big shots from the previous generation finally calmed down.</p>
<p>“The legend is true, it’s not a baseless assertion.” A paragon, aghast, took several steps back and murmured: “They are the mythical spirits of the saints that have always been protecting Dongting Lake.”</p>
<p>For a very long time, rumors have been circulating in this sea, stating that Dongting Lake was protected by the saints of this world. However, many snorted at this claim, especially skeptical due to the decline of the lake. They believed that this was only a false rumor, that these spirits were intangible and baseless.</p>
<p>However, everyone today saw these spirits in person, the real power of Dongting Lake that had been keeping watch over them.</p>
<p>“How impudent!” With reddened eyes, the Bloodshark Sovereign crazily roared. He initially wanted to break the banner in the sky in order to kill Li Qiye. However, everything happened too quickly. His army was massacred so fast that it caused his eyes to flush red. Under a blinding rage, he wanted to kill the Indomitable Battalion.</p>
<p>“Leave your dog life with me.” Li Qiye interjected while the sovereign was lunging for the battalion.</p>
<p>“Little animal!” The sovereign instantly turned around and stared at Li Qiye in a frenzy.</p>
<p>Li Qiye slightly raised his right hand and slowly enunciated: “Trident, come.”</p>
<p>His words turned into mantras and the mantras turned into laws.</p>
<p>“Splash! Splash! Crash!” The water in the lake crazily churned as if it was boiling. A boundless divine light came from within.</p>
<p>This light illuminated the world. A gigantic formation with countless engraved runes emerged from the lake. This great and ancient array was connected to the veins of the lake.</p>
<p>At this time, the lake seemed to be a living entity, as if a dragon heart was beating within its earth. People could hear a powerful and resonating thump.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The light sprayed everywhere as if gods were descending to this world.</p>
<p>Within this light, a great spear emerged. It was simple and natural. There were three sharp prongs at its tip. It looked like an ordinary decorative artifact, but such an ancient style resembled the opening of a world.</p>
<p>It was clearly formed by the water in the lake, but it gave the sensation that it weighed billions of pounds. It seemed that outside of sea gods, no one could handle this great trident. [1. The raw is actually one hundred billion, but it is just being used as a large number and not an exact amount, so billions work better.]</p>
<p>“The Trident!” Even someone as incredible as the sovereign turned silly after seeing this great weapon. He turned haggard and stumbled backward.</p>
<p>The sea demons watching from a distance shouted its name as well. The masters from the other races all gasped.</p>
<p>“Is that our sea god’s Trident?” The eyes of all the sea demons widened in astonishment.</p>
<p>“No—” An old sea demon paragon carefully looked at this trident and was jolted. He quickly blurted: “This isn’t the real Trident, it’s only an imitation!”</p>
<p>Many sea demons felt relieved after hearing this revelation. One of them murmured: “Lucky, it’s just a fake.”</p>
<p>The Trident was the symbol of the sea demons. It carried the greatest significance in their hearts, the spiritual totem in their minds.</p>
<p>Thus, only the supreme of their race, the sea god, was qualified to wield this invincible symbol.</p>
<p>If the Trident fell into the hands of the humans, it would be too great of a blow to their race and drive them completely mad.</p>
<p>It was no wonder why they were so worried. Ever since the start of Immortal Emperor Ta Kong’s generation, a sea god had yet to appear. The same was true for their Trident.</p>
<p>The last sea god was Lithodidae; he appeared during Immortal Emperor Yin Long’s generation. [2. Ta Kong = Space Trample, Yin Long = Roaring Dragon.]</p>
<p>So now, when the Trident appeared out of nowhere, all the sea demons naturally became alarmed. They thought that it had fallen into the clutches of Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>Unlike the relieved sea demons, the Bloodshark Sovereign’s eyes were still glaring at the Trident.</p>
<p>He was once accepted by the Trident, so he had it under his control during his youth. It was the most glorious time of his life. Back then, his cultivation soared by leaps and bounds. Many of his talented peers lost to him, including the young Lithodidae Sea God.</p>
<p>This quick jump in power placed him among the top echelons. Later on, the Trident abandoned him for some reason and chose Lithodidae instead, allowing him to become a true sea god.</p>
<p>Losing the Trident cut off his path to becoming a deity. From then on, his life fell into a trough. Even though he continued to cultivate and made progress, he couldn’t regain the surging years of yore and his old invincibility.</p>
<p>Later on, since he wasn’t willing to give up, he also tried to create an imitation of the Trident. However, the only result was failure. These fake tridents didn’t have the same unstoppable power. Ultimately, they were only scrap metal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until many years of experimentation that he realized that he couldn’t understand the profundities of the true Trident. Creating a replica was simply impossible. In fact, many sea demons had tried to do so for millions of years now. Even for those who were successful in copying the Trident, the end result was a weapon much weaker than the real deal.</p>
<p>His mind quivered as he looked at the Trident before him. Due to his past, he was very familiar with its power. Even though this was only an imitation, it had the unstoppable might of the real Trident.</p>
<p>“Trident…” He was both scared and shocked. He didn’t expect to see such an imitation, his lifelong pursuit!</p>
<p>However, he was also frightened because he knew the power that he was about to face!</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1278: No Mercy</h4>
<p>Chapter 1278: No Mercy</p>
<p>The Trident was an eternal legend. Sea gods relied on this weapon to contend against Immortal Emperors. It was the reason why the two entities were considered even.</p>
<p>The Trident was something unique to the sea demons. Its power even exceeded that of Immortal Emperor True Treasures.</p>
<p>Even though the one ahead was only an imitation, the force exuding from it still deterred the sovereign’s very soul. It was something that belonged only to the real Trident.</p>
<p>This imitation was no match for the real thing, but it still emitted a force capable of causing any sea demon to tremble.</p>
<p>“This can’t be real…” The pale sovereign couldn’t believe his own eyes. Why did a human succeed in creating a copy of the Trident even though so many sea demons had failed? This was completely inconceivable to him.</p>
<p>He quickly gathered his wits and shifted his body in order to cross through the void to escape. He had no desire to fight against this trident.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The great formation under the lake lit up. An infinite amount of power burst out like a volcanic eruption. In a short period of time, it pushed the trident flying as if a gigantic hand had just thrown it.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The void collapsed and a black hole emerged. Even though the sovereign had fled quite far, the Trident caught up to him in an instant.</p>
<p>“Activate!” The sovereign was frightened by this pursuit, but he had no way out. He shouted and summoned his most powerful weapon while channeling his strongest defensive technique in order to stop the trident.</p>
<p>“Bang!” The Trident penetrated his weapon and barrier then continued to fly towards him with an unstoppable momentum.</p>
<p>“No!” His mournful cry echoed across the ocean. Drops of blood fell into the sea and dyed it red.</p>
<p>The sovereign was crucified to death just like that. His eyes were still wide open in disbelief. This was not the result he envisioned at all, thus he died with many regrets.</p>
<p>The entire world turned gloomy. All the sea demons who saw this were aghast as a cold tingle went down their spines.</p>
<p>The older sea demons questioned in a daze: “How can this be?”</p>
<p>The Trident had ended the sovereign’s future once by abandoning him, and ultimately, an imitation ended his life. It seemed that this was all part of karma. The sovereign couldn’t escape his connection to the weapon. He owed it both glory and death. It was as if the heavens was playing a cruel joke on him.</p>
<p>“That’s the hidden power of Dongting Lake.” The lake was now viewed as an object of fear. Everyone understood that the lake had an imitation trident on top of the spectral army.</p>
<p>A charming spirit ancestor solemnly spoke: “So many years have passed, but the lake is still like before with its invincible power.”</p>
<p>After seeing its power today, who would dare to have any ideas about it in the future?</p>
<p>Even the disciples from the lake were slack-jawed. They had never imagined that things would play out this way. Hong Tianzhu, the other elders and the protectors were astonished as well. They never knew that the invincible ancestors had always been protecting them.</p>
<p>Just recalling how they had abandoned everything from their ancestors for their own benefits left them ashamed. How could they stand and face their ancestors later on?</p>
<p>For many, many years, the lake had never worshiped the ancestors with ceremonies. They had all but forgotten about the traditions, yet the ancestors still continued to protect their unfilial children and the lake. Their hearts were full of shame and regret.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crowd was still deterred while watching the four cavalries in the sky. This spectral army could truly sweep through all enemies.</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s cold voice resounded: “Don’t think about leaving when you’re already here.” It was chilling to the bones.</p>
<p>Feiyan woke up from her stupor and sorrow. She wanted to escape as fast as possible. In her mind, as long as the verdant hills remained, there would be no fear of running out of firewood.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t get far before Li Qiye blocked her path. Her pretty face became twisted after seeing him. Moreover, it was blanched from both fear and fury with a touch of despair.</p>
<p>This was the enemy who had killed both her father and little brother. She wanted nothing more than to tear him to pieces. However, reason told her that as long as she stayed alive, everything would be possible in the future, including killing this enemy to avenge her family.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to die, for everything would turn to ashes afterward. Her sect was the Roaring Conch. As long as she could go back, she would have the opportunity for vengeance.</p>
<p>These were the thoughts that occupied her mind. She stood there and didn’t dare to act rashly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye fixated his gaze on her. All the spectators watched with bated breaths.</p>
<p>Prior to this, many people were bullish about Feiyan because she had a strong backing. However, in the blink of an eye, the situation had reversed completely. Feiyan, who should have won for sure, became a dog with a dead owner.</p>
<p>Li Qiye flatly asked while looking at her: “Don’t you want to kill me?”</p>
<p>While locking their eyes, Feiyan gritted her teeth, her smoldering fury evident in her gaze. She cried out his name: “Li Qiye!”</p>
<p>He leisurely replied: “I understand your hatred.”</p>
<p>“I want to peel your skin, drink your blood, and taste your flesh!” She shouted: “I swear to never live under the same sky with my father’s murderer!”</p>
<p>“So what?” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded: “I am a ruthless person, not to mention that I have given you ample warnings, yet you still dared to oppose me. Therefore, you must experience the massacre.”</p>
<p>She was livid. Her sworn enemy was standing in front of her, but there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>He continued on: “I’ll borrow your words. Kneel and accept death, or do I have to kill you myself?”</p>
<p>She understood that there was no chance for survival, so she cried out: “Li, either you or I have to die. I would rather die if you exist in this world!”</p>
<p>He insipidly replied: “Very well, at least you have some courage. Still better than your little brother, not begging before death.”</p>
<p>“Li! Do you dare to fight me? If I lose, I will have no complaints. Otherwise, I will haunt you as a scornful ghost!” She made a clear decision since she knew there was no escaping. What she was worried about was the spectral army and the Trident from the lake.</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “I’m not even afraid of gods, let alone mere ghosts.”</p>
<p>She restrained her anger and continued with her plan of fighting him one on one. Even if she had to pay with her life to kill him, she would consider avenging her dead family a good end.</p>
<p>“However, since you are so eager for revenge, I’ll satisfy your wish.” He smiled: “You think you actually have an opportunity, so I shall grant it to you. I like shattering someone’s self-esteem and confidence so that they can have a taste of despair.”</p>
<p>She found a glimmer of hope in this desperate strait and immediately shouted: “Good, Li, this is your choice. We will fight one on one, a gentleman’s words cannot be taken back!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was amused and answered her coldly: “Don’t gauge a gentleman’s heart by using one’s own wretched scale. Don’t worry, I, Li Qiye, will always keep my word. Killing you won’t require any external help.”</p>
<p>“Very well, we’ll fight to the death!” Feiyan felt jubilated after gaining a chance for revenge.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at her with one eye and said: “Go, die in despair, a fate reserved for my enemies.”</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone held their breaths while watching this scene. Even though sea demons felt sympathy for Feiyan and wanted to help, none of them dared to try and rescue her.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1279: Seavinity Banner</h4>
<p>Chapter 1279: Seavinity Banner</p>
<p>This marine region was drowned in a state of quietude. No one dared to breathe loudly as they watched the confrontation between Li Qiye and Shangguan Feiyan play out.</p>
<p>“Summon!” Feiyan took out a banner and held the pole with one hand. An oceanic atmosphere assaulted the spectators; it was as if this flag was gestating a god.</p>
<p>The sea demons here quivered before this banner. They felt an urge to kneel and worship due to an instinctive sense of respect that came from nowhere.</p>
<p>“The Seavinity Banner, a weapon left behind by a sea god from the Roaring Conch!” Someone immediately shouted after seeing the banner. [1. Exact raw is Sea God’s Banner. Sea god is a term that is used too much already. For example, in that sentence, I would be repeating sea god twice. The other problem is that Sea God’s Banner sounds like a descriptor and not an actual artifact. What if another sea god has a banner? Thus, this made me want to use Divinity Banner or any other adjective similar to divine/hallowed, but this would leave the sea part out. Adding sea to it makes the title too long, and I’ve been hesitant towards using long titles for readability recently. Seavinity includes both; it is a made-up word, but for a proper name, this shouldn’t be an issue, especially after readers see this footnote and understand my thought process.]</p>
<p>It instilled fear and awe into the spectators. This was the flag of a supreme sea demon; it represented their invincibility and glory.</p>
<p>Even though the Trident was the most powerful weapon during the reign of all sea gods, they had no way of retaining it. When they died, the Trident would fly away and reappear when it was time to choose a successor in the next generation.</p>
<p>Because of this, no one viewed the Trident as an inheritable weapon. Each sea god would create their own powerful artifacts and weapons, but none of them could compare to the Trident. However, these artifacts truly belonged to them and were able to be passed down to their descendants.</p>
<p>The banner in Feiyan’s hand was a weapon created by a Roaring Conch Sea God.</p>
<p>“She actually has a sea god’s weapon.” Both the young and old of the sea demon race became quite envious.</p>
<p>Even though the Roaring Conch had two sea gods, it also had millions of disciples. It was quite a glory to inherit a sea god’s weapon. This was enough to show just how much the sect valued her.</p>
<p>Feiyan shouted with the banner in her hand: “Li, you must stay true to your word, don’t change your mind in front of the world.”</p>
<p>She was afraid that he would change his mind after seeing this weapon and wouldn’t want to fight her alone! After previously losing to him in just one move, she understood that her strength was no match for his. In her mind, he was at least a True Monarch or a Bestowed Monarch.</p>
<p>Thus, she placed all of her hopes for revenge on this weapon! Because she was afraid of him reneging on the deal, she loudly shouted so that everyone could hear her. If Li Qiye were to change his mind today, his reputation would be destroyed.</p>
<p>“You are too funny. Let alone make me change my mind, you actually think that you can do something to me with this sea god’s banner? This is such a blatant underestimation.” He shook his head and laughed: “Very well, since this banner is giving you so much faith in your revenge, I’ll shatter it.”</p>
<p>With that, a saber hymn resonated through the sky. With a saber in his hand, he coldly stared at her.</p>
<p>An imperial aura engulfed the region with its coming. With the Benevolent Saber in his hand, an immortal aura surfaced around his hand. The weapon seemed to become one with him.</p>
<p>This blade was the true fate weapon of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Its creation required painstaking efforts from both the emperor and Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Today, his ability to wield the blade was no less than if the emperor was using it himself. The only thing missing was the Heaven’s Will. If Li Qiye had the Heaven’s Will, he would be able to exert the same power from this blade as the emperor of past.</p>
<p>“An Immortal Emperor True Treasure!” Hailing from the Roaring Conch, Feiyan knew her stuff. Her face paled as she stumbled backward.</p>
<p>At this moment, her pupils contracted, revealing both fear and despair! Even though she had a sea god’s banner, the blade in Li Qiye’s hand was a true treasure!</p>
<p>With respect to comparing the weapons of sea gods and Immortal Emperors, the Trident was the first part of the equation. True treasures were no match for its power — this was the reason why sea gods could fight against Immortal Emperors!</p>
<p>However, without the Trident, sea gods were only Emperor Assailants at best; they couldn’t truly fight against a real emperor. Because of this, the arsenals they personally create were no match for imperial weapons, let alone a True Treasure.</p>
<p>Despair reared its ugly head again in Shangguan Feiyan. It was just like Li Qiye had said, her hope had been shattered.</p>
<p>The banner that she thought would allow her to get revenge for her father and brother paled in comparison before his True Treasure!</p>
<p>Many sea demons were astounded to see his weapon as well.</p>
<p>A sea demon blurted in disbelief: “Isn’t he the successor of Peacock Land? A tree controller? Since when did he become a descendant of an Immortal Emperor? To actually have a True Treasure!”</p>
<p>Many knew about Li Qiye’s status as Peacock Land’s successor, but no one would ever have thought that he would be the owner of a True Treasure as well.</p>
<p>Li Qiye insipidly said: “I told you that I would crush your hope.” [1. This is too cruel now…]</p>
<p>“Buzz!” Li Qiye poured his vitality into the blade. At this moment, he seemed to be incredibly far away, as if he was standing above the nine layers of the heavens.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The world trembled. Li Qiye unexpectedly emitted the aura of an Immortal Emperor. The blade lit up, allowing its snow-white edge to illuminate the horizon. The blade itself seemed to be returning to life as an eternal existence.</p>
<p>“How, how can this be?” Many people were dazed as Li Qiye seemingly turned into an emperor. Many of the people with weaker cultivations dropped to the ground due to weakened knees under his pressure.</p>
<p>They found it completely inconceivable as they gazed at Li Qiye in the sky.</p>
<p>“No way! Even a Godking can’t bring an Immortal Emperor True Treasure back to life!” A commenter’s voice was trembling.</p>
<p>“It is because he has been recognized by the True Treasure. This is quite rare no matter the generation.” A human who understood these weapons understood what was happening.</p>
<p>“Thump. Thump. Thump.” Feiyan kept on faltering before this scene. True despair had struck her.</p>
<p>“Li, I’ll die with you!” Feiyan plunged into madness. She spat a great amount of longevity blood onto the banner. Her complexion turned deathly white afterward.</p>
<p>This determined her demise. Despite her young age, she had used all of her blood as an offering for the banner. Even if she could win this fight, she wouldn’t be able to live much longer due to her withered lifespan.</p>
<p>“Aiming for mutual destruction… even victory won’t let her stay alive.” Everyone knew that it was over for her.</p>
<p>“Boom!” After the refinement, the banner became much more brilliant and poured down gigantic universal laws. These pillar-like laws plunged into the vast sea.</p>
<p>“Splash!” Tidal waves of endless height assaulted the sky. All of these pillars of water intertwined with the laws to turn into a stout figure.</p>
<p>At this time, the banner coiled around this aquatic figure, turning it into a deity. If was as if a sea god had returned to life. This figure turned and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Boom!” The world quaked with his coming. His celestial flames engulfed the entire region. The grand aura emanating from this sea god spread across the Dragon Demon Sea as if a real sea god was here in person.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” Many sea demons were stirred and prostrated on the water. Some even broke into tears.</p>
<p>An astonished human asked in horror: “Is that a resurrected sea god?”</p>
<p>“No.” An older human gently shook his head and explained: “This is a tribute. She used all of her longevity blood in order to bring about one invincible strike from a sea god! All of the forces from the weapon have been gathered into this blow. Victory or defeat will depend on it.”</p>
<p>“Can Li Qiye withstand a blow from a sea god?” Miss Lin’s group was quite worried after seeing the gigantic figure.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1280: Public Execution</h4>
<p>Chapter 1280: Public Execution</p>
<p>An invincible attack from a sea god would take everyone’s breath away. Countless beings quivered in fear before this suppressive aura.</p>
<p>“Clank!” The saber sang again and became exceedingly bright. The blade itself disappeared to turn into the world’s most brilliant light. It illuminated the ten continents and imprisoned everything with its resplendence.</p>
<p>It was the combination of an imperial aura and an unstoppable saber intent that culminated within Li Qiye. This saber intent rose above the heaven and earth before suppressing the Yin and Yang. Up in the sky, Li Qiye was the saber and the saber was him.</p>
<p>A peerless blade — there was no better word to describe this current saber intent. It was omnipresent and engulfed the entire world; there was no escaping it.</p>
<p>At this second, everyone could feel themselves being immersed in its intent instead of the sunlight. It was as if the Benevolent Saber had replaced the sun over yonder.</p>
<p>“He has not only been accepted by the weapon, he has also mastered an invincible dao of the saber. With the blade in his hand, he can combat an endless horde of foes!” Even God-Monarchs felt chills while looking at Li Qiye becoming one with his weapon.</p>
<p>“Die!” There was no other way for Feiyan. She let out a cry after offering everything she had. This moment would either end in the death of her or Li Qiye. She wouldn't mind mutual destruction either.</p>
<p>Her only choice was to face him directly. Death was certain whether she tried to flee or fight, so she might as well go all out!</p>
<p>“Rumble!” As her battle intent surged, the sea god made out of water stepped towards the sky. Each of his steps shattered the void as if it was made from porcelain. This was a magnificent scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laws of the grand dao were screaming. They couldn’t contend against this sea god.</p>
<p>“Bang!” The figure finally attacked with a hand that stretched across the world in the form of a mudra. Ancient aquatic runes erupted like a volcano. Each rune resembled a tiny star. These stars then came together to crush everything in its path to ashes.</p>
<p>People’s souls left their bodies the moment this sea god’s mudra emerged. Its power of suppression sank deep to the soul; everyone was completely powerless under its might. They were currently helpless kittens and as insignificant as specks of dust — not enough to reach the apex.</p>
<p>Li Qiye made his move against this mudra. His blade traveled through the sky and illuminated myriad eras. It severed the Yin and Yang and extinguished the karmic cycle.</p>
<p>“Clank!” One sabre to alarm countless realms. This light lit up every single corner of the world, even hell itself was no exception. The gods and devils had nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>This was the first of the three Benevolent Slashes, nothing in this world could hide from its brilliance! Everything became straightforward and clear. Dark and light, Yin and Yang, life and death — everything lost their abstruseness in the face of this slash.</p>
<p>It was no longer just a saber technique but a type of righteous will that belonged to Immortal Emperor Min Ren. He wished to save all sentient beings.</p>
<p>Everyone would feel inadequate and ashamed when met with this attack. Evil had no place to hide; it would turn into smoke from this illumination. Sea gods and devils seemed especially insignificant in the face of this attack.</p>
<p>“Boom!” This slash didn’t waste time as it severed the sea god’s mudra and the divine creature itself.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The water returned to the ocean like waterfalls as the gigantic figure slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>The banner was left in the sky, but a corner of it had been cut off by the Benevolent Saber.</p>
<p>“Buzz!” The damaged banner howled and quickly fled to the horizon.</p>
<p>“No—” The one to scream was not Shangguan Feiyan, but rather a few of the spectating sea demons.</p>
<p>It was too great of a blow for them. A sea god was killed; their supreme had been defeated.</p>
<p>A sea demon sect master murmured in a daze: “That’s not a real sea god anyway, it was just a battle intent of the weapon.” Even though he was correct, it didn’t hide the sadness in his mind.</p>
<p>“Slaughtering a god…” The human cultivators, on the other hand, felt their blood boiling.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in the current Dragon Demon Sea, sea demons reigned supreme. Sea gods were untouchable existences and were considered to be invincible in this race’s minds.</p>
<p>But today, the Benevolent Saber came out and immediately killed the sea god in addition to severing a piece of the banner. This was a blow to the confidence and morale of the sea demons.</p>
<p>The humans were elated by this event. This would go down as a glorious part of their race’s history.</p>
<p>A human couldn’t hide his pride and resoundingly exclaimed: “Our Immortal Emperors are invincible, regardless of the era!”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei witnessed this scene and emotionally spoke: “The Benevolent Three Slashes are said to be the emperor’s proudest saber techniques. Some even say that he placed it even higher in his heart than his Heaven’s Will Secret Law. A rumor states that this technique combined with the saber is completely unstoppable unless the opponent has the Heaven’s Will!”</p>
<p>Feiyan was petrified like a statue. The thing she relied on the most had flown away after being defeated. Her only hope has been shattered, so she stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>“Kneel and accept death.” Li Qiye emotionlessly stared at her with his blade pointing straight at her.</p>
<p>Feiyan’s mind returned. She immediately tumbled backward with no color in her complexion.</p>
<p>She shouted: “Never!” Even at this moment of defeat, she still held her head up proudly.</p>
<p>With the shining blade in his hand and a surging saber intent, Li Qiye coldly uttered like a supreme emperor: “It is not up to you to decide!” The imperial aura continued to assault the world. His order was completely irresistible.</p>
<p>These auras absolutely trampled over her pride. With a bang, her knees gave in to the pressure.</p>
<p>“No!” Even before death, she still stubbornly derived laws in order to turn into a phoenix and soar to the sky. In her mind, she would rather commit suicide than be killed while kneeling.</p>
<p>“Bang!” However, her transformation was quickly put down by the saber intent. Her struggle only weakened her. She prostrated on the ground with her kneecaps shattered.</p>
<p>Her resistance could have been stronger. Unfortunately, she had offered all of her longevity blood to the Seavinity Banner, so she no longer had the same strength as before.</p>
<p>Li Qiye slowly raised his blade and declared: “In this world, I don’t care about those who oppose me. Even a defeated enemy can be allowed a dignified death. However, those who think that my human race has become weak and tiny enough to become slaves or incubators, mere objects for sex... I shall destroy their entire race and devoid them of a dignified death…”</p>
<p>“I am not the guardian of the human race or the savior of this world. However, sea demons and treants, listen to me well: I am a human, so if you wish to enslave my people, think carefully about the consequences!” Each of his words was resounding and sonorous with determination. They pierced straight into everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>“Pluff!” The blade chopped down and Feiyan’s head flew up. It eventually rolled on the ground as her blood gushed and stained the sky red before dripping down into the sea.</p>
<p>A beloved daughter of the heavens, a genius of the sea demons, a young God-Monarch was beheaded while kneeling. This scene shook the heart — this was especially true for the suffocated sea demon spectators.</p>
<p>“Our race might be weak, but we will never become slaves!” A human cultivator had tears in his eyes while he tightly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, the human race was quite weak. Cultivators from the Exquisite Valley were better off, but as for vagabonds or smaller sects, they suffered bullying and repression from the sea demons everywhere.</p>
<p>Today, Li Qiye’s actions made the crowd jubilant with pride.</p>
<p>As for the sea demons, they stayed silent before this blatant provocation in the form of an execution. They knew that without sufficient strength, opposing Li Qiye was suicidal!</p>
<p>Li Qiye put away the Benevolent Saber and returned to the banner. He gazed at the horizon and commanded without mercy: “Indomitable Legion, heed my order. Destroy Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. When the sun rises tomorrow, they must be no more.”</p>
<p>“Bang!” The battalion answered with action. The expedition had begun as the troops separated into two groups. One headed straight for Wyvern while the other aimed for the village.</p>
<p>This invincible regiment instantaneously crossed through space.</p>
<p>Someone without any knowledge of its origin murmured in a daze: “This, this spectral army is too invincible…”</p>
<p>An old charming spirit ancestor watching from the distance murmured: “A legion from the legends… Even an imperial legion suffered continuous defeats. Even if they have died and turned into ghosts, they are still invincible! A truly unstoppable force.”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1281: Massacring The Enemies</h4>
<p>Chapter 1281: Massacring The Enemies</p>
<p>There was no suspense to the Indomitable Battalion’s expedition. Remember that they once bested an imperial legion time after time on the battlefield with a matchless momentum.</p>
<p>Today, it didn’t matter how strong Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were, they were simply no match.</p>
<p>“Rumble!” On this day, this sea region was sent into turmoil with tsunamis everywhere as if the ocean itself was howling.</p>
<p>“Kill!” The echoes of war resounded in both Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. Alarms rang everywhere as defensive barriers were erected in their ancestral grounds.</p>
<p>Alas, despite mustering all of their strength with elites rushing to the battlefield alongside their ancestors, they couldn’t change their fate against the iron hooves of the Indomitable Battalion.</p>
<p>“Kill them…” Eventually, the war cries grew weaker. The lucky survivors stopped being so lucky on the battlefield. Their blood dyed the ocean red while their corpses floated on its surface.</p>
<p>“Boom!” Eventually, the regiment shattered the ancestral grounds of the two sects. In just one night, two great powers had been erased from the Dragon Demon Sea. The disciples who managed to survive basically lost everything with the loss of their ancestral grounds.</p>
<p>One day prior, the army of 100,000 was very confident in their conquest of the lake. The troops were full of morale. In their eyes, on top of winning their resources, they could also enslave the lake’s women and use the excellent bloodlines of the human race to reproduce.</p>
<p>They were extremely excited for their triumphant return. Then, it would be time to drown in the debaucherous feasts and pleasures.</p>
<p>However, they never thought that this would be their last expedition. It turned into a sect-destroying disaster. Not only did they fail to destroy the lake, the lake's spectral army destroyed all of them instead.</p>
<p>The demise of these two sects caused ripples across the entire sea demon race.</p>
<p>Even though these two were far weaker than sea god lineages, they were plenty strong and could be listed among the top ten in this sea region. However, they were annihilated as if they were nothing.</p>
<p>In the end, the Indomitable Battalion returned to the banner. They were still as emotionless and cold as before. No matter the time, they seemed to be drowned in a sea of blood.</p>
<p>Countless people felt a stinging shiver deep in their hearts in the face of this spectral army. This was a true machine of war!</p>
<p>While hovering under the banner, Li Qiye coldly uttered: “Those who covet Dongting Lake, I hope all of you have gotten a good look.”</p>
<p>People felt suffocated when they heard his words. The sea demons who wanted to take advantage of the situation were breaking out in cold sweat.</p>
<p>They praised their own fortune for not going forward earlier. Otherwise, they would have suffered the same fate as the two great powers.</p>
<p>“Splash!” The lake water gushed as the battalion sank into the lake, disappearing completely. They became one with the lake; as long as the lake continued to exist, so would they.</p>
<p>“Buzz.” The supreme formation of the lake opened only to close after the Trident flew in.</p>
<p>A lot of sea demons stared at it with envy. Even experts from sea god lineages were quite jealous because many sea gods had tried to copy the Trident to no avail. Everyone knew that this weapon before them was only an imitation, but it was still extremely strong.</p>
<p>Envy and jealousy were one thing, but no one dared to have any ideas about it. They weren’t tired of living just yet.</p>
<p>“This is the foundation of the lake.” An old paragon murmured: “No wonder why no one tried to do anything against the lake in the past. It would be too reckless.”</p>
<p>The disciples of the lake stared at this scene with astonishment. They never thought their lake had something this powerful up its sleeves.</p>
<p>In the end, the silver fox disappeared. The war banner flew back into the chamber and hung itself on the wall once more.</p>
<p>Serenity came with the end of this battle. Many people assumed that the lake was about to be destroyed. No one expected Wyvern and the village to perish instead.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gave one last glance at everyone before returning to the lake. Hong Tianzhu’s group immediately followed him back.</p>
<p>The crowd was relieved to see him gone.</p>
<p>An old man murmured: “That guy is too heaven-defying. With him here in Heaven Spirit, it looks like the humans will have an Immortal Emperor.”</p>
<p>“Way to state the obvious.” The human cultivators were naturally feeling very proud right now: “He is a tree controller, the master of Dongting Lake and also a prince of an imperial lineage. Who can become the Immortal Emperor of this generation other than him?”</p>
<p>Of course, these humans didn’t know Li Qiye’s identity and were only blurting out their thoughts. In their eyes, as long as Li Qiye became an Immortal Emperor, it would be the glory of the human race. No amount of praise would be sufficient for him at this moment.</p>
<p>The sea demons were quiet with ugly expressions. After all, Li Qiye had dealt too many blows to their race recently. His dispatch of the Teeming Fish and utilization of the spectral army to deal with two great powers destroyed the sea demons’ morale and left them breathless.</p>
<p>“Our sea demons also have some supreme geniuses.” A sea demon felt like retorting because Li Qiye’s fame was at an all-time high.</p>
<p>“Yes, our supreme geniuses have yet to take action.” Another sea demon echoed the sentiment: “We still have the Seashield Prince and Seven Martial Goddess. Rumor has it that if the prince has a grand completion Immortal Physique, he could assail an Immortal Emperor. If he could become a sea god, he’ll be even more formidable with the Trident.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, there’s no need to raise the enemy’s prestige while lowering our morale.” An older sea demon rallied his people: “The goddess is incredible too. She is a peerless prodigy that has learned the seven grand styles, so who can actually stop her in the present? As long as she uses her techniques, even a Godking will have to make way.”</p>
<p>Another sea demon replied: “Yes! The seven grand styles of the martial pavilion are unstoppable. Even the secret laws of Immortal Emperors cannot compare to them. Just remember that back then, the sea god from the pavilion used the seven styles to fight against an emperor. Who in this world could withstand all seven styles?”</p>
<p>“The moment the seven styles appear, its user will be unbeatable.” Whether the sea demons were getting nervous or just wanted to raise their morale, the praise went on: “I’m afraid even Immortal Emperors can’t stop all seven styles. Hmph, there’s no way that a junior can do it.”</p>
<p>The styles of the Seven Martial Pavilion were indeed legendary. These praises weren’t mere exaggerations.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, some people believed that anyone who could learn all seven would be able to assail an Immortal Emperor even without becoming a sea god. This was the greatest martial technique in the world!</p>
<p>In fact, the sea demons who were desperately praising the seven styles had never seen them before or knew what the stances were.</p>
<p>This was because these styles were rarely used. Another believer stated that there was no one alive who had witnessed all seven because no one could withstand the entire barrage!</p>
<p>A human was tired of the boasting and coldly uttered: “Hmph, Immortal Physique? Seven grand styles? So what, we have Li Qiye.”</p>
<p>“Well, Li Qiye won’t be invincible to the very end. Hidden dragons and crouching tigers are everywhere in Heaven Spirit. Not to mention us sea demons, the Jade Sea has countless descendants of treefathers and bearers of the finest of bloodlines. And over at the Abyss Sea, charming spirits are the favorite children of the heavens, they are destined to be great.”</p>
<p>Another sea demon retorted: “Yes, you humans shouldn’t forget about the charming spirits. There are countless powerful spirits that don’t care about fame or fortune. Not to mention the Profound Monarch, rumor has it that the Puresun Daoist of the Ancient Spirit Island has reached grand completion in the Indestructible Diamond Physique. Some people might not be well-known, but it is only because they are low-key. Not everyone likes to show off all the time. The real masters rarely show themselves.”</p>
<p>It was really a bad day for the sea demons. Their arrogance had been completely snuffed out by Li Qiye and they were unable to oppose him, so boasting was the only thing they could do.</p>
<p>The smart humans didn’t reply after hearing this answer from the sea demons with regards to real masters. A retort would only be offending the treants and the charming spirits. There would be nowhere to go if they were to be found out.</p>
<p>Of course, those who knew the truth like Jian Longwei didn’t care enough to mince their words: “This is a case of using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken. In this generation, for both sea demons and charming spirits, if they still think their race is invincible, a second massacre like the one just now might repeat itself.”</p>

<h4>Chapter 1282: Turning Over A New Page</h4>
<p>Chapter 1282: Turning Over A New Page</p>
<p>Inside the chamber of the lake, Li Qiye returned to the master chair with a natural and nonchalant demeanor, yet he still gave off a stately and imposing aura.</p>
<p>He was supreme in his throne and capable of deterring emperors and gods. No one would dare to disobey his orders.</p>
<p>The elders, protectors and supervisors of the lake all participated in this gathering. They quietly sat in their positions while respectfully gazing at Li Qiye.</p>
<p>The walls were still decorated with the portraits and a banner in the center. In the past, even the disciples of the lake didn’t care about these portraits.</p>
<p>But today, everyone from the lake felt an instinctive reverence towards these decorations without exception. Before entering the chamber, they would tidy their clothes and posture without showing the slightest sign of disrespect.</p>
<p>It was because this place represented the glory of their ancestors and the highest authority of the lake.</p>
<p>The four Virtuous Ancestors had been killed while the other ancestors were imprisoned. This caused a great stir in the lake and a monumental change to its current power structure.</p>
<p>Li Qiye coldly looked at everyone present. The high-ranking members here felt a chill run down their spines from his glare.</p>
<p>“After today, everyone should understand the glory of the lake as well as your own responsibilities.” Li Qiye flatly said: “I have returned the glory of past to all of you once more as well as control of the lake and its future direction…”</p>
<p>“... In the future, whether Dongting Lake shall deter the world and illuminate the nine continents or continue to fall like a group of stray dogs vying for bones and power will be up to each and every one of you!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye went on: “Its future is in your hands now. The younger generation will be the ones to hold the reigns, not those old geezers blinded by power!”</p>
<p>With that, he shifted his eyes over to the outstanding disciples like Hong Yujiao.</p>
<p>In the past, not even the elders could show up in these deliberations. The majority of the grand events were secretly decided upon by the ancestors. Now, even the youngest disciple was allowed to participate.</p>
<p>“Your ancestors have laid a solid foundation for everyone, a magnificent starting point.” Li Qiye stated: “I have restored this foundation. With such an ace, I won’t get involved again regardless of the lake’s fate if all of you can’t amount to anything.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble, rest assured. From today on, we will not dishonor the glory of our ancestors or disgrace them in any way. Our generation shall obey the iron creeds and inherit the union. We swear on this with our true fates and definitely won’t let you down.” Hong Tianzhu prostrated on the ground and resoundingly swore with his true fate!</p>
<p>In his eyes, this was the best time to change the lake. If they were to miss this moment, it would be prohibitively difficult to try again later on.</p>
<p>The other members glanced at each other and read the situation very well. They quickly prostrated just like Hong Tianzhu and swore with their true fates as well: “Our lake shall obey the iron creeds and inherit the union once more without regret!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye slowly nodded approvingly: “Very good, it is for the best that everyone has this much determination. Do not bring dishonor to your ancestors’ glorious bloodline.”</p>
<p>These high-elders and those of lower rankings had all the authority in the lake right now and had sworn with their true fates to obey the ancestral teachings once more. From today on, the lake would turn over a new page.</p>
<p>“Dongting Lake was created together by the Xu, Lin, Hong, and Zhang Clans. As their descendants, remember this, your lake also includes the Zhang Clan!” Li Qiye flatly said: “I don’t care how your ancestors divided the docks in the past, just remember that from today on, the eighteen docks belong to the lake and not any individual clan! It is time to hand over these resources in a sensible manner.”</p>
<p>Zhang Baitu was also present. Li Qiye’s words left Hong Tianzhu’s group and those of the previous generation embarrassed. The Zhang Clan was squeezed out of the lake completely while the other clans divided up their docks.</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu hurriedly said: “Young Noble, the Hong Clan shall hand our seven docks back to the lake. We will distribute the heavenly grottos and roads as well in accordance with the iron creeds.”</p>
<p>In fact, the Hong Clan was very powerful right now since they had seven out of the eighteen docks. Nevertheless, Hong Tianzhu was the first to give these resources back to the lake.</p>
<p>“Our Lin Clan is also willing to return our five docks.” The others came forward and willingly gave back their territories.</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded: “This is for the best. The lake’s future will be in your hands. Remember, your clans must unite with great solidarity just like your ancestors. Competing for petty authority and power will only lead the lake down a path of destruction. Your internal conflicts will destroy you before your enemies can even make a move.”</p>
<p>Some elders felt their faces burn after hearing this. It wasn’t that the lake wasn’t strong or lacked resources. Unfortunately, ever since those Virtuous Ancestors focused on gaining more power, outsiders started to think that the lake was easy to bully. Ultimately, even lineages like the Bloodshark Village and Wyvern threatened them with military expeditions.</p>
<p>“The four regiments have returned to their positions. The iron creeds shall take effect once more.” Li Qiye looked at them and said: “From today on, a new page shall be turned for Dongting Lake. This is all I will do to help, the future will be up to you all.”</p>
<p>With that, he got up from his chair and took one last glimpse at the banner and portraits before leaving the chamber.</p>
<p>The members present were quiet. They lowered their heads with countless emotions running through their minds.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was an outsider, yet he could control their lake’s spectral army and the Trident. Moreover, his own power could suppress everyone here. However, he didn’t even take a single glance at this great force before him. He had no love for the authority here nor did he demand their resources.</p>
<p>As for themselves, the lake clearly belonged to everyone, but they selfishly killed and marginalized each other, resulting in great disunity. As the descendants of the clans, they never treated the lake as their own home, only a feast to be divided.</p>
<p>No matter how they looked at it, it was a very shameful matter. They had let down their ancestors.</p>
<p>While drowning in this shame, many elders and protectors clenched their fists. If they didn’t cherish and protect their own home, why would others respect them? The lake was the home of every disciple and descendant, it didn’t belong to an individual.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t leave the lake right away. He stayed for several days to bask in the atmosphere of this place while fully enjoying the scenic waters.</p>
<p>This might his last chance to stay at the lake. In the future, he might never come back, so he wanted to rest and make some new memories.</p>
<p>He sighed while looking at the sparkling water. Countless heroic souls were buried at the bottom of the lake. In their final moments, they decided to refine their souls and turned into spectral soldiers that permanently rested in this place.</p>
<p>In the eyes of others, such actions prevented them from entering the reincarnation cycle. To be reincarnated was a source of hope for many cultivators, so they would never be willing to do such a thing.</p>
<p>However, this once invincible battalion ultimately chose to do so. It was because of their great love and attachment to this land. Even in death, they chose to protect this land and their descendants.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sentimentally reflected: “Perhaps this is the best place for home.” In the long years, everyone had their own path.</p>
<p>At this time, someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p>Li Qiye focused his mind and lightly spoke: “Come in.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1283: Be A Maid?</h4>
<p>Chapter 1283: Be A Maid?</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu walked in and bowed after seeing Li Qiye: “Greetings, Young Noble.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded in response: “Keep at it. As long as you try your best, the lake’s future will be just fine.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu indeed had the will and ambition to change and strengthen the lake. Alas, his ability was still lacking.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Without Young Noble, the lake would not be like this today. We shall remember your kindness for generations to come.” Tianzhu bowed once more.</p>
<p>Tianzhu thought that without Li Qiye, even if he wanted to make a change, it would have been useless. Even if the talented young disciples were on his side, he still wouldn’t be able to do anything to the ancestors, let alone the four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
<p>“No need to thank me.” Li Qiye sat there while looking at the lake and answered: “I did it because of your determination. This is also the blessing of your ancestors, so if you want to thank someone, thank your ancestors. They are the ones who are lying in the ground; dead for millions of years, yet they are still worried about their children.”</p>
<p>“I know your abilities are limited.” Li Qiye looked at him: “From now on, go ask Jian Longwei for help. This will be good for both your cultivation and ability to make allies…”</p>
<p>“Can, can I do it?” He wasn’t completely confident and scratched his head in response.</p>
<p>Even though he was the current master of Dongting Lake, Jian Longwei was the Jian Grandfather, a supreme character. Hong Tianzhu would be reaching above his post.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll let them know.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “The truth is that the lake and the Jian Clan had a deep friendship. Unfortunately, due to your clan’s failures, the Jian Clan decided to ignore you later on. Of course, they cannot be blamed for this.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Tianzhu lowered his head in shame. In the past, the lake had many allies and even strong ties with the Exquisite Valley. Unfortunately, when the four Virtuous Ancestors abandoned the iron creeds, they destroyed their own future.</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued while looking upon the lake: “Even now, I do not agree with humans staying in the Heaven Spirit World. Your ancestors had opportunities to settle down in the other places of the nine worlds. However, they had too much love and attachment to this land, so they ultimately decided to stay here.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu quietly listened since he knew very little about his ancestors’ past.</p>
<p>Li Qiye shook his head forlornly and looked at Tianzhu: “No matter what, the lake is deeply related to the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. Your ancestors prepared this land very well, so it is up to you now. If you fail to correct yourselves, the existence above the clouds will stop caring about your lake. As long as you keep on trying, your lake will be able to stand strong in the future.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye rarely said such thoughtful words, but he did so this time out of consideration for the lake’s ancestors.</p>
<p>He reminded Tianzhu: “Remember, with their spirits protecting you, even in difficult times of monumental change, there will always be a chance to overcome the disasters. You must protect this land just like they did or you would be unfilial and completely unworthy of their love.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu carefully took in every single word. Even though he didn’t fully understand the true implications behind them, he still firmly memorized them.</p>
<p>He bowed once more: “I’ll engrave your golden advice in my heart.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye nodded and quietly stared back at the lake. One day, a disaster shall befall the Heaven Spirit World. Everything would change at that point.</p>
<p>In the end, he chose not to think about it. He would no longer be in Heaven Spirit when that day comes. Their fate is in their own hands.</p>
<p>“Is there something else?” His mind returned and he noticed that Tianzhu was still standing there respectfully.</p>
<p>“Well…” Tianzhu wryly coughed with an awkward posture. He didn’t know how to phrase his question.</p>
<p>Li Qiye lightly urged: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>After thinking for half a day, Tianzhu still didn’t know what to say. Eventually, he decided to directly ask: “Young Noble, what do you think about my daughter?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled in response: “She is not a bad lady — full of potential. Her temperament might be a bit too fiery, but she is still quite sensible.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Young Noble, you are too kind.” Tianzhu smiled. He mused a bit before gritting his teeth to ask: “Young Noble, if you think it is possible, how, how about she go along with you?”</p>
<p>After saying what was on his mind, he felt relieved, as if he had carried out his responsibility.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled without replying, so Tianzhu quickly added: “Young Noble, don’t misunderstand. You are a true dragon from the nine heavens, so my daughter can’t climb up that high. What I mean is, she can run errands for you and do whatever she can to help. This will broaden her horizons and train her insight.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu knew full well that Li Qiye would one day soar to the sky. He could even become an Immortal Emperor one day, and his daughter naturally couldn’t become the imperial queen.</p>
<p>He only wanted her to follow him for the experience. Even by being a maid, she would still gain a lifetime of benefits.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “Your daughter is a good girl, but unfortunately, I can’t keep her around.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu didn’t give up, he wanted a good future for his daughter. Staying at the lake would only limit her life’s experience. As for him, his responsibility dictated that he would die here. It was not the same for her, he wanted her to see the vast world. Without a doubt, Li Qiye was the best person to entrust her to.</p>
<p>“It is not that I dislike her.” Li Qiye gently stated: “But she cannot follow my path.”</p>
<p>Tianzhu held his tongue after not knowing what to say while feeling disappointed.</p>
<p>“Father, I have my own life, so I will go down my own path.” Yujiao rushed in from outside. She was a little red and looked a bit annoyed. She had clearly heard Li Qiye earlier.</p>
<p>“Sister, don’t go in.” Another girl was startled by her sudden intrusion and was trying to pull her back. It was Miss Lin. She couldn’t stop Yujiao at all.</p>
<p>Tianzhu quickly scolded: “Why did you come in?”</p>
<p>“Father, I am not a child, I don’t need you to arrange everything for me.” Yujiao stomped her foot after saying this, both anger and embarrassment evident in her expression.</p>
<p>Tianzhu hastily reprimanded: “Don’t spout nonsense or be rude in front of Young Noble.”</p>
<p>Yujiao felt that she couldn’t stay here any longer due to shame, so she angrily stormed away.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, my daughter was impolite just now. I’ll go talk to her.” Tianzhu bowed and apologized to Li Qiye before chasing after her.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t care too much about Yujiao’s little tantrum.</p>
<p>With those two gone, only Li Qiye and Miss Lin were left in the room. She tensed up and didn’t even know where to rest her hands as she was simply too nervous.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister is a good person, she was just a little bit angry earlier, that’s all.” She spoke soft words to defend Yujiao.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile while looking at this girl as gentle as an orchid. He eventually asked: “What is your name?”</p>
<p>Her heart fluttered as she was stunned like a fawn and began to stammer: “My, my name is Lin Miao.”</p>
<p>She raised her head to look at Li Qiye only to blush before immediately lowering her face.</p>
<p>She was normally not such a timid person. She could greet guests and communicate freely and gracefully. However, she was especially tense in front of Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“The holy and wonderful bloodline of the Lin Clan.” He looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>The nervous girl nodded multiple times in response: “Yes, yes, but Senior Sister's bloodline is even better than mine. My holy bloodline can’t compare to hers.” Her cheeks were flushed pink.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1284: Lin Miao</h4>
<p>Chapter 1284: Lin Miao</p>
<p>Looking at the girl lowering her finely-sculpted forehead, Li Qiye gently shook his head: “There are no good or bad bloodlines, no one is born destined to be noble or wretched.”</p>
<p>“Really?” She secretly stole glances at him before nervously retracting them right after.</p>
<p>Li Qiye insisted in a serious manner: “I don’t need to lie to you. My words are true and come from the heart.”</p>
<p>“I, I didn’t mean to question your words…” Lin Miao thought that he was offended and almost started crying.</p>
<p>Li Qiye wryly smiled at this tense girl and said: “Sit down, we’ll have a talk about bloodlines.”</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment before finally sitting down next to him. Her fair complexion was heating up, but she felt a bit happy inside.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at her and earnestly spoke: “There are no noble or lowly bloodlines, at least, not in my eyes. For the rest of the world, many people believe they have noble bloodlines, but how many of them were ultimately stomped on by those with lowly bloodlines?”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Sitting next to him left her with an indescribable sense of satisfaction. His soft and charismatic voice was sweet music to her ears.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Li Qiye continued: “For ages, how many Immortal Emperors have been viewed by others as ones who possessed weak bloodlines? Not all of them had a noble upbringing. Even imperial children might lose to the common man.”</p>
<p>“As long as you have a noble dao heart, you will be the one with the noble bloodline.” He elaborated: “Many peerless existences were proud not because of their bloodline, but because of their dao heart. Be righteous, confident, and determined — these traits are more precious than anything else.”</p>
<p>“I, I heard that Young Noble, you have an imperial bloodline. In my eyes, you are nobler than anyone else.” Her eyes darted at him again. After saying this, she felt quite hot and bothered.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled in amusement and gently shook his head: “It doesn’t matter whether I have an imperial bloodline or not. All I need is my firm dao heart. With it, the entire world will be within my grasp. When I fail, I can still lift my head and break through all setbacks, becoming stronger than before. And even in success, I will not forget who I am. An indestructible dao heart will grant you eternality.”</p>
<p>He earnestly told her: “Maintain a strong dao heart to be in control of everything.”</p>
<p>“Well, of course, Young Noble, you are the true dragon of the nine heavens, victory will always be on your side.” She couldn’t help but praise him. In her eyes, Li Qiye was perfect. Embarrassment got the best of her again after her momentary lapse of emotions. She lowered her head once more.</p>
<p>Li Qiye explained: “You can also become a phoenix that soars in the distant horizon as long as you are determined enough.”</p>
<p>“Even, even someone like me?” Lin Miao’s mind trembled as if she had been struck by thunder. Becoming a phoenix was something she never dreamed about.</p>
<p>His words swept through her mind like lightning, as if he was showing her the most beautiful light in this world.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Li Qiye chuckled: “No one is born blessed or doomed. If your intentions are righteous, then you are noble! Countless people have risen against the heavens to change their fate. In the long river of time, some with humble beginnings left behind indelible marks.”</p>
<p>He gave an example: “For instance, Empress Hong Tian. She was only an ordinary girl born in an era full of geniuses, she couldn’t be any more ordinary.”</p>
<p>He paused for a bit before continuing: “But this ordinary girl surpassed countless difficulties. She laughed and cried but she never faltered. In the end, she trampled numerous geniuses and slew plenty of imperial princes. Her firm dao heart paved a path towards invincibility.”</p>
<p>Lin Miao listened while looking at Li Qiye. She was fascinated by his ordinary features. This common appearance was incredibly attractive as if it was a spell. She could look at him forever without tiring. The same was true for his pleasant words; they were full of wisdom and charisma.</p>
<p>“The empress’ motto was this: how can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan? She kept this in mind all her life, so she was named Hong Tian.” Li Qiye told Lin Miao: “You can also do this instead of thinking you are inferior to others just because of your bloodline.” [1. I learned something here. I used to think Hong Tian meant Grand Heaven, but after this explanation, Hong Tian is most likely describing a swan flying freely in the sky. Hong can mean swan/great/grand. I suppose her title would be Heavenswan or Skyswan instead of Grandheaven, if we were to translate this title to English.]</p>
<p>Lin Miao was enchanted by this revelation. She eventually murmured: “How can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan?”</p>
<p>This single phrase illuminated her life and would bring about a new change. She saw unprecedentedly bright colors.</p>
<p>This was an issue she didn’t ruminate in the past. In her eyes, the lake was large, but it couldn’t compare to sea god and Immortal Emperor lineages.</p>
<p>She was only a common disciple from the lake. There were other senior brothers and sisters that were much more excellent in comparison. For example, her close friend Hong Yujiao was better than her in virtually every respect.</p>
<p>Thus, her life would only be a bit eventful at best. It was impossible for her to join the ranks of Shangguan Feiyan or the legendary Seven Martial Goddess. This, on the other hand, gave her peace. Her pursuits weren’t overly ambitious and she was satisfied with just following her own pace and doing what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>But now, Li Qiye’s words revealed a potential radiance never-before-seen in her life. It was a guiding beacon that she could follow.</p>
<p>“Dreams exist where the mind is.” He smiled: “Back then, your lake’s four clans didn’t have the same resources as you do today. But in the end, they became an invincible legion. With great comradery, they swept through the battlefields with their children for the sake of their clans and left behind an indelible prestige.”</p>
<p>He stared at her deeply and declared: “Your ancestors became something even stronger than an imperial legion not because of their unparalleled bloodline or incredible background, but because they had dao hearts that would never accept the word ‘defeat’.”</p>
<p>Lin Miao emotionally palpitated. A feminine girl like her still felt her blood boiling when recalling the glory of past. She became momentarily dazed and suddenly, a dream took shape in her heart. She murmured: “Dreams exist where the mind is...”</p>
<p>“That’s right. If you are willing, anything is possible.” Li Qiye encouraged: “The future of the younger generation is the future of the lake. No one else can control the fate of the lake other than all of you.”</p>
<p>She secretly stole glances at Li Qiye several more times after calming down before quietly responding: “I, I don’t dream about becoming invincible like the ancestors. I just want to live a comfortable and happy life.” She was worried about what he would think of her answer and nervously lowered her head again.</p>
<p>“As long as you keep on walking with great persistence and a goal, then all is fine. Whether you become invincible or not, leave that up to your fortune.” He continued: “But you must try to protect the lake. If you young ones don’t protect your own home, who will?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She busily nodded, true to her thoughts. Right now, she felt that everything Li Qiye said was incredibly reasonable and wise.</p>
<p>“Stick to it. Work hard and protect what you hold dear so that your lake can have a better future.” He showed a rare gentleness: “I will leave the lake to your generation, can do you it?”</p>
<p>In the end, Li Qiye still wanted the best for the lake. Hong Tianzhu’s group was too old, so it was up to Lin Miao and her peers to take care of the lake in the future.</p>
<p>The shy girl felt warmth and happiness. Li Qiye just said he wanted to entrust the lake to her. Just how much trust and hope was this?</p>
<p>She eventually met his gaze and mustered courage out of nowhere to decisively answer: “I, I’ll listen to you.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1285: Departure</h4>
<p>Chapter 1285: Departure</p>
<p>While looking at her firm gaze, Li Qiye nodded and smiled: “I know you can definitely do it.”</p>
<p>These words were spoken with credence. They gave her power like an immortal nectar and made her feel as if her body was floating among the clouds.</p>
<p>Such simple words carried great influence and impact. They were more pleasant than anything else Lin Miao had heard before. Very shortly, she was overwhelmed with joy and felt something sweet like never before.</p>
<p>“You are about to drool.” Li Qiye chuckled after seeing her dazed state.</p>
<p>She regained her wits with a blush that spread to her neck, making her feel quite hot. Nevertheless, she was in a great mood due to the long lasting aftertaste.</p>
<p>He smiled and concluded: “Go. One day, you shall soar through this world like a phoenix.”</p>
<p>Her heart fluttered with jubilation. Even her steps felt lighter as she walked outside. Before leaving, she turned back and asked: “Will, will I see you again?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye lamented in his mind after seeing her expression. This was an unfortunate feeling, but he still showed a smile and nodded: “If it is meant to be. If I am not in this world in the future, you can find me above the nine heavens.”</p>
<p>“I got it.” She looked deeply at him, letting go of her shyness as if she wanted to carve his face and appearance deep in her mind to never forget them.</p>
<p>After she left, he finally sighed and looked at the lake to say: “Emotions come and go, having no emotions is easier than otherwise. But how many could actually reach a true state of emotionlessness?”</p>
<p>With that, he closed his eyes to enter a state of zen, no longer caring about external affairs.</p>
<p>Several days later, Jian Longwei came to pick him up. Even if he didn’t, Li Qiye would leave the lake anyway.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei asked after seeing him: “Your Excellency, the divine dragon has sent word. The preparations are complete, will you leave right now?”</p>
<p>“I should go today.” Li Qiye softly answered while looking at the lake through a window.</p>
<p>Longwei asked: “You do not wish to stay a bit longer?” In fact, he was hoping that Li Qiye could stay at the Jian Clan for a short while.</p>
<p>Li Qiye turned to look at him and smiled: “You have grown up to be quite excellent, I have nothing to teach you. As for your descendants, those who are capable will be personally taught by the old geezer. I won’t steal his thunder.”</p>
<p>He went on: “I have met your ancestors and said my goodbyes. Lingering any further would only exacerbate my frustration.”</p>
<p>The ancestors he mentioned were Jian Wendi and Jian Wenxin.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei nodded silently. He didn’t know much about the past, but he had heard something about Li Qiye and their ancestral aunt. [1. Aunt because Wendi is the progenitor.]</p>
<p>“I’m very happy about how prosperous the Jian Clan has become.” Li Qiye smiled: “Even though humans are merely passersby in the Heaven Spirit World, this is not true for your clan, this is your home. As long as your progenitor and the older geezer are here as well as the mountain and the dragon kingdom, your clan shall stand strong.”</p>
<p>“Our progenitor only wishes for his descendants to stay here.” Jian Longwei added: “I heard some ancestors wanted to open a separate branch in the Mortal Emperor World, but his venerable did not agree.”</p>
<p>“This is where he belongs.” Li Qiye gently sighed: “Like many others, he has a deep affection and great love for this land; he’s more than willing to take root here in this life and the next.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye also understood that Jian Wendi still had a dao hurdle in his heart. This sister and brother duo couldn’t overcome this ridge in their hearts.</p>
<p>Their father had hurt them too deeply, so those two would never want to return to the Mortal Emperor World. That was a land full of heart-wrenching pain, the place they experienced their most difficult years.</p>
<p>Of course, Li Qiye could sympathize with their horrific past, so he never forced them to do anything.</p>
<p>Longwei asked: “Your Excellency, where do you wish to go?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked up towards the far horizon in response: “The Bonesea. I’m finished with my business here, so it is time for me to leave.”</p>
<p>“The Bonesea…” Longwei shuddered.</p>
<p>The Bonesea was one of the twelve burial grounds, an extremely ominous location. As a taboo location of legends, even a Godking like him wouldn’t carelessly tread through it since it was a path of no return.</p>
<p>Of course, he knew that for a supreme existence like Li Qiye, he could easily travel to any place as if it was flat ground.</p>
<p>Eventually, Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and spoke: “I want to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, please go ahead.” Jian Longwei quickly bowed in response: “If this disciple knows about it, I will definitely let you know.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye paused for a moment before slowly asking: “How has the Celestial Pavilion been in the last two generations or so?” [2. The actual raw is Heavenly Immortal Pavilion, but the most common meaning behind the combination of Heavenly + Immortal is a goddess/fairy/beautiful women. It can also be used as a particular class of immortal, such as celestial/heavenly immortal or earth immortal. In this case, I’m refraining from using fairy and goddess because it isn’t the same word. Heavenly Immortal is just too long and it doesn’t fit the real meaning of both the word and context; immortal and heavenly has been used too much already. Celestial is a better choice.]</p>
<p>Longwei was a bit surprised by this topic, but he hurriedly answered: “Your Excellency, the Celestial Pavilion is still holding strong as one of the most powerful lineages in the Heaven Spirit World. However, it has become increasingly reclusive, their disciples rarely show themselves.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye asked with sorrow: “Is the Lunargrasp Fairy still in this world?”</p>
<p>This simple question startled Jian Longwei, but he answered right away: “Your Excellency, I heard the fairy is still in this world, but I have never seen her. After the divine dragon bestowed my title, I personally visited the Celestial Pavilion. The pavilion lord told me that she is still alive, but even the ancestors from their sect can’t seek an audience.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye internally bemoaned: “So many years...” He knew that he had to face certain things or it would forever be an unresolved knot.</p>
<p>Longwei didn’t know the relationship between Li Qiye and the fairy. He quietly said: “The progenitor has said that the fairy is one of the strongest beings in Heaven Spirit right now. His Venerable himself felt that he couldn’t match up against her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she has always been that powerful. How could she not be?” Li Qiye sentimentally responded: “She was someone who competed against Empress Hong Tian for the Heaven’s Will and even defeated the empress many times when she was younger. She is indeed mighty.”</p>
<p>“The progenitor also said that Heaven Spirit has the Lunargrasp Fairy while Mortal Emperor has South Emperor. Those two were the most gifted during that era.” Longwei found this topic quite interesting.</p>
<p>Empress Hong Tian’s generation had geniuses coming out in droves. It could be considered a magnificent era.</p>
<p>Immortal’s Legacy — these words were used to describe the Lunargrasp Fairy. One could easily imagine just how incredible her talents were from this title.</p>
<p>“Their talents were indeed peerless during that era.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement and continued: “Even though there were as many geniuses as there were stars in the sky back then, they were still as dazzling as ever. However, South Emperor and the fairy were very different people. South Emperor was an elegant hermit while the fairy was an unyielding warrior.”</p>
<p>Longwei was taken aback by this statement. Generally speaking, men were more prone to be considered warriors, but Li Qiye described the fairy as one. This made him wonder just how domineering she used to be.</p>
<p>Eventually, Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Let’s go, it is now time.” He left the room afterward.</p>
<p>Longwei busily kept up right behind him.</p>
<p>Before his departure, Hong Tianzhu’s group showed up to bid farewell. They saw him all the way out of the lake.</p>
<p>Li Qiye told the group: “Go back, even if you see a friend off for a thousand miles, you will still have to part in the end.”</p>
<p>Hong Tianzhu and the others respectfully kneeled and worshipped him: “Young Noble, take care. May we meet again.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and took one last good look at the green Dongting Lake before flying to the sky with Jian Longwei.</p>
<p>As he was leaving, Lin Miao mustered courage out of nowhere and shouted in his direction: “Young Noble, take care!”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked back at her and revealed a faint smile before leaving with a nod.</p>
<p>Lin Miao watched his departing figure in a trance. She eventually smiled, firmly engraving his image in the deepest part of her heart.</p>
<p>After a long time, Tianzhu told Lin Miao: “Child, let’s go back.”</p>
<p>As a senior, how could he not see it? He could only gently shake his head because Lin Miao and Li Qiye were people of different worlds. It might be too difficult for them to meet again in the future.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1286: Giant Dragon Mountain Range</h4>
<p>Chapter 1286: Giant Dragon Mountain Range</p>
<p>The Giant Dragon Mountain Range was shrouded in mist, so no one could see its true appearance. The word mysterious had always been its defining characteristic.</p>
<p>Many wanted to enter in order to understand its nature, but they had always failed. Legend states that there was a kingdom in these mountains. No one knew whether this was true or not because none had visited it.</p>
<p>Standing on top of a hill with an aura unique to this mountain range, Li Qiye looked over the undulating mountains. Once inside, one would find the area was completely different from its external appearance.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that vast continents were rare in Heaven Spirit. In fact, the only landmass considered to be a real continent was Godhalt.</p>
<p>However, if one could enter the mountain range, they would find that the ground they stood on looked like a great continent comparable to Godhalt.</p>
<p>Of course, few were privy to this scene. Even those who were qualified to enter would probably not tell outsiders about their experience.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled: “Giant Dragon Kingdom.” He found the kingdom a very interesting location.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t plan to visit the Dragon Kingdom this time and had no desire to give those rascals there a beating.</p>
<p>He gently shook his head and continued on his way. At this point, he was all by himself since Jian Longwei couldn’t follow him.</p>
<p>He went quite deep into the mountain range through hills and deserts, after which he was met with a volcano and another ocean.</p>
<p>It seemed that this place had formed its own realm as it was full of vast lands. With the absence of humans, a draconic aura permeated every corner of this place.</p>
<p>For humans, being exposed to this aura would result in a very strong pressure. After all, dragons were mighty, so weak cultivators couldn’t withstand their auras.</p>
<p>Li Qiye, on the other hand, enjoyed basking in this aura. For him, it was too comfortable. This journey had been a pleasurable trip for him.</p>
<p>“True dragons, the ultimate transformation of a demon dragon. Cleansing and refining their blood until it becomes the strongest and most precious bloodline in the world...” Li Qiye emotionally said: “The title of divine dragon is indeed apt.”</p>
<p>Outsiders didn’t know that every inch of this mountain range was quite precious. It was a treasure land that allowed the future generations to prosper.</p>
<p>Li Qiye murmured: “This bloodline is quite exquisite. The old geezer’s choice was truly wise. Otherwise, they would definitely become feasts for the emperors and gods above the nine heavens.”</p>
<p>The old geezer’s offspring were powerful because they had inherited his bloodline. Of course,, they were far inferior to the old man himself. Nevertheless, a thick bloodline of a true dragon coursed through their veins.</p>
<p>In the outside world existed very diluted true dragon bloodlines. If the old geezer’s descendants were outside, others would consider them as true dragons.</p>
<p>For their race, their precious bloodline was both a blessing and a curse. It was needless to mention the advantages, they were destined to be powerful. The disadvantages were clear as well; because their bloodline was so strong, it was difficult for them to reproduce.</p>
<p>It could be said that in Heaven Spirit or even the entire nine worlds, no other race had such a difficult time reproducing as the dragons. Fortunately, their lifespans were relatively long, or else they would have become extinct long ago.</p>
<p>Because of this, the geezer needed the Jian Clan because only their imperial bloodline was worthy of their race. Moreover, both sides had a relationship thicker than blood. The old geezer trusted the Jian Clan; this played a great part in why the Jian Clan was the only lineage in Heaven Spirit that could stay in Rainbow City.</p>
<p>In fact, the other four clans of Dongting Lake had deep ties with the dragon mountain as well. However, this was a matter of long ago.</p>
<p>The other issue with their bloodline was that, through cultivation, they could reach atavism and cause their blood to become even purer.</p>
<p>This, in turn, made them hesitant to compete against the rest of the world. The reason was that once a member of their race becomes an Immortal Emperor, they would have to face the world inhabited by gods and emperors.</p>
<p>Just imagine, their precious bloodline would become a nutritious feast, a high-level liquid for life-prolongment.</p>
<p>They would only become prey in such a place. It was very difficult for their tribe to establish a stronghold under such circumstances. This was why the old man’s race chose to be reclusive and stay unknown to outsiders.</p>
<p>Li Qiye eventually reached his destination after a long trek. This was a barren land with only loess in sight. Eventually, he stood before an ordinary looking hill and heard clanking gallops from a horse.</p>
<p>He smiled right away and approached the stone wall. There was an entrance to a cavern at its base. It looked normal, but there was a fence seemingly made from white ivory.</p>
<p>A skeletal horse was pacing back and forth in front of this entrance as if it was waiting for something. This was the very horse that appeared in the ocean in the past, the mount of Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Who would have thought that it would be here?</p>
<p>Of course, it was given permission by the old geezer. Otherwise, even an emperor’s mount wouldn’t have been able to reach this location.</p>
<p>“Neigh—” It roared after seeing Li Qiye and aggressively lifted its frontal hooves. This was clearly an antagonistic posture.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be blamed. Li Qiye had transformed into the young emperor in order to trick it. From its perspective, he was an enemy.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “There’s no need to be so hostile towards me. Maybe you will ask me for help in just a bit. At that time, it would be too late if you try to suck up to me, right?”</p>
<p>“Neigh—” Despite being mere bones, it still had a great amount of spirituality, so it could understand Li Qiye. As a result, it didn’t attack him despite its hostile behavior.</p>
<p>Li Qiye stood before the entrance and took a look before praising: “This place is pretty well sealed. Once locked inside, not only can it evade everything, nothing can come out either.”</p>
<p>There was a great mystery behind this cavern. Just the fence that sealed it was made from heaven-defying dragon bones from the geezer himself! Its power was unimaginable.</p>
<p>There was not much in the cave itself outside of a cage inside a pit on the ground that was completely inserted into the earth.</p>
<p>The pit itself was filled with an extremely black liquid. There might not be something darker than this liquid in this world. It could absorb all light, including the rays of the sun. There was no escape after being devoured.</p>
<p>At a first glance, someone would actually mistake it for a black hole. It was not an inanimate object either. Occasionally, it would slightly creep around. A full range of motion was impossible because it was in the pit. At the very least, it seemed to be alive.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was all smiles after seeing this liquid as he murmured: “That old geezer really risked it back then, to actually lock this thing down here. Who else in this world could actually accomplish this?”</p>
<p>This stygian liquid was brought back by the old man from the Bonesea. It had a frightening origin. The old man sealed it here for his own use, but he never got around to using it.</p>
<p>It didn’t look particularly conspicuous, but if people knew of its usefulness, they would break heads vying for it. Even Immortal Emperors would bring treasures here to make a deal with him.</p>
<p>His eyes then shifted towards a corner of this cave. There was an object there.</p>
<p>To be exact, it was two items — a pair of eyes. These eyes seemed to be casually placed in the corner as if they had been abandoned.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1287: A Pair Of Eyes</h4>
<p>Chapter 1287: A Pair Of Eyes</p>
<p>These eyes seemed to be quite archaic, as if they were plucked out from a living being and left in this corner long ago.</p>
<p>They were well-preserved in this place, not at all withered by the passage of time.</p>
<p>They suddenly lit up at this very moment. Prior to this, they seemed to be closed, but now, they were opening. The eyes suddenly shifted, not in a tumbling sense, but the gaze seemed to be rotating in a very bizarre manner. Anyone would be frightened by this weird scene.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but grin. He understood something after seeing it and said: “Bu Si, you brat. It looks like you hid your eyes in this place. You must have paid a great price to do so.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the world knew about the collapse and destruction of Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Who would have thought that he had left his pair of eyes in this eternally secluded location, capable of evading everything and anything?</p>
<p>“Geezer, let’s do it.” Li Qiye touched the fence made from dragon bones and looked to the sky with a smile.</p>
<p>“Squeak—” A heavy sound came about. At this time, the fence slowly rose to the sky and the cavern was made available to Li Qiye.</p>
<p>“Neigh—” The horse was especially excited to see the seal being removed and lifted its hooves up high. It had been waiting for this moment and quickly rushed for the cavern in order to take the pair of eyes.</p>
<p>However, it immediately stopped and slowly retreated to the entrance. Despite being all bones, it could tell that the black liquid inside the cage was quite dreadful.</p>
<p>“Neigh—” The horse raised its hooves again and stared helplessly at the eyes in the corner.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled when he saw the horse’s appearance and leisurely asked: “Do you need my help now?”</p>
<p>The frustrated horse looked back at Li Qiye. It still had the same hostility as before.</p>
<p>Li Qiye noticed this but didn't care too much. He shrugged and continued with a smile: “You can hate me or whatever, I won’t mind since I am such a benevolent person. However, what can you do in this situation? Will you continue to act hostile, or will you let it go and ask me for help?”</p>
<p>The horse glanced between Li Qiye and the eyes in the corner. With another neigh, it seemed to agree with Li Qiye. Despite this being the case, there was still a trace of caution in its demeanor.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled: “Don’t look at me like that. If I really wanted to take you down, you wouldn’t be standing here right now. Your background might be incredible, but I could have pinned you to the ground long ago.”</p>
<p>“Neigh—” The horse roared again as if it found this reply displeasing. Nevertheless, its hostility had been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Li Qiye grinned and revealed: “My demand isn’t high for helping you get those eyes. I just want to ride you for a bit later on, I believe this is quite fair.”</p>
<p>The horse tilted its skull while contemplating. It resembled a human more than a skeletal horse.</p>
<p>In its eyes, Li Qiye was not a nice person at all. Its sentient self remained very cautious towards him.</p>
<p>Li Qiye laughed and added: “Okay, what other choice do you have if you refuse?”</p>
<p>The horse let out another neigh before nodding its head. Without a doubt, it had accepted the condition.</p>
<p>“Very well, now that’s a good horsey.” Li Qiye satisfyingly beamed and reached out to pat the horse’s head.</p>
<p>It still didn’t completely accept Li Qiye, so it shook its head to get his hand off. Li Qiye’s smile disappeared as he withdrew his hand and then proceeded to enter the cavern. He went to the corner and picked up the pair of eyes.</p>
<p>He didn’t immediately give it to the horse and instead carefully inspected it. The eyes met his stare with a curious glance as they darted about like the inquisitive eyes of a baby.</p>
<p>After a careful examination, Li Qiye couldn’t help but smirk: “Immortal Emperor Bu Si, it looks like you still have an opportunity to turn things around. Brat, you are indeed full of schemes, to actually come up with something like this.”</p>
<p>The eyes didn’t understand what Li Qiye was saying. They looked like they weren’t only curious about Li Qiye, they wanted to find out everything about the outside world.</p>
<p>“For generations, no one has been successful, but you have actually done it, not bad at all.” Li Qiye grinned while looking at the eyes: “Fine, I’ll lend you a hand. I will help you open your eyes.”</p>
<p>With that, universal laws formed in his palm and rippled like the surface of a lake. He further derived these laws to expose their boundless potential and pointed at the pair of eyes.</p>
<p>“Neigh!” The skeletal horse by the entrance grew nervous and loudly howled. It wanted to rush in several times, but the black liquid truly frightened it. It was afraid that Li Qiye was doing something unfavorable to the eyes.</p>
<p>“Buzz—” When Li Qiye’s finger touched the eyes, the boundless laws instantly jumped into them. At this point, a new world seemed to be opening in these eyes. This world was filled with color and swelling water — a magnificent scene.</p>
<p>Inside the eyes, a sun rose while a moon fell. A great sky emerged with winds and clouds. Generations changed from one to the next with continuous transformations between prosperity and stagnation… A grand universe was floating up and down within them.</p>
<p>The tense horse finally became relieved after seeing this. It had misunderstood Li Qiye; he was helping the eyes instead of harming them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pair of eyes, full of curiosity, looked at the universe within. Everything seemed to be new and full of surprises.</p>
<p>Li Qiye then took it out of the cavern and looked at the horse while smiling: “If I wanted to harm them, would I have bothered to make a deal with you?” Having said that, he put the eyes into the horse’s eye sockets.</p>
<p>“Neigh!” The horse excitedly roared. It took several steps backward to slowly adapt to its new eyes.</p>
<p>The truth was that this scene was incredibly bizarre. A horse comprised of only bones had gained a pair of human eyes — anyone would be creeped out after seeing this.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored the horse and entered the cave again. With runes in his palm, he carved them on the cage and then lifted it up: “Open!”</p>
<p>“Clank!” The other half of the cage under the ground was slowly being lifted by Li Qiye. Eventually, the whole cage was lifted up.</p>
<p>The black liquid in the pit began to stir in the midst of this process. It seemed as if Mt. Tai, a weight of trillions of pounds, had been removed from its body.</p>
<p>It stretched out a bit and slowly streamed out from the pit. A more accurate description would be that it was crawling out from its imprisonment.</p>
<p>“Neigh!” The horse was very afraid while watching this. It retreated to maintain a certain distance from this liquid.</p>
<p>The liquid cheered after finding out that it was finally free. Even though no sound came out, its shape and form made its jubilation apparent.</p>
<p>Just like that, it darted out of the hole like a gust of wind; it was excited to see the sun again.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1288: Item Left Behind</h4>
<p>Chapter 1288: Item Left Behind</p>
<p>Li Qiye followed the liquid out of the cave. After seeing the sun, the liquid found itself free and happily soared into the sky. Shortly after, a black ray short towards the Bonesea.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and patted the horse: “Go, follow right behind it. This will make it easier for you to enter the forbidden zones in the Bonesea.”</p>
<p>“Neigh!” The skeletal horse let out a roar and raised its frontal hooves before leaping into the sky. It disappeared in the black liquid’s direction.</p>
<p>Li Qiye murmured after seeing this: “Brat, I hope you can do it. It will definitely be a miracle. But of course, your current self is already a miracle.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye was not in a hurry to chase after the horse and the black liquid. He took his time leaving the mountain range.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei was already waiting outside for him with a wooden box in his hands.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei looked towards the Bonesea’s direction and curiously asked: “Is the Bonesea about to emerge?”</p>
<p>“It’ll be lively for some time at the western Bonesea. Many people who have been coveting items from there won’t be able to sit still.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the horizon.</p>
<p>Jian Longwei didn’t comment. Even though the items there might be precious, he wanted nothing to do with them. Plus, this was a different generation; he didn’t want to leave Rainbow City at all.</p>
<p>He calmed down and respectfully raised the wooden box towards Li Qiye with both hands: “Your Excellency, the progenitor wanted me to give you this. He said that this is something our ancestral aunt left behind; it is related to Empress Hong Tian. The ancestral aunt gave this to the progenitor before passing away, but he didn’t know when to give it to you. He said that this might be your last time visiting our Jian Clan and perhaps your last meeting, so he ordered me to give it to you.” The ancestral aunt was Jian Wenxin.</p>
<p>Li Qiye accepted the box and opened it to take a look inside. After a while, he gently closed it and sighed.</p>
<p>“It is all in the past.” He put the box away and spoke with a hint of sadness: “I had already let go of this matter back then and didn’t blame anyone. Immortality… perhaps I was wrong…”</p>
<p>Jian Longwei hesitated for a moment before stating: “The progenitor said that before she passed away, she also hoped that you could forget about the issue with Empress Hong Tian…”</p>
<p>“You don’t know Empress Hong Tian, and Wenxin didn’t either.” Li Qiye smiled and gently shook his head: “I’m not blaming her for it. She has always been incredibly stubborn, but I don’t want her to change. Pride is part of her nature, her stubbornness is actually a little adorable…”</p>
<p>He recalled the olden days with the stubborn girl and couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>Even though they got into quite a fight and went their separate ways despite their complete trust in each other, Li Qiye had never blamed her.</p>
<p>Longwei was quiet since he didn’t know too much about his predecessors. Sometimes, he heard his progenitor talk about the relationship between the Dark Crow, Empress Hong Tian, and the ancestral aunt. It was too complicated for outsiders to understand.</p>
<p>After a long time, Li Qiye glanced at Longwei and said: “Your Jian Clan can co-exist with the dragon kingdom, so I’m not worried at all. You are the lord of the clan, but I don’t have any good advice for you. Just keep trying your best and continue to pass down your bloodline. It hasn’t been easy for the clan to last this long; your progenitor has spent a miraculous amount of effort. This is also the reason why he has been hanging on to dear life all this time…”</p>
<p>“... He is too reluctant to leave his descendants for he is full of love. His aspiration is to protect those children forever, to give them a peaceful life. He loves you all and this land wholeheartedly. His reason for living is not something personal, it isn’t because he fears death. It’s because he can’t bear to leave, there are too many things in this world that make him worry.” He gently sighed at the end.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi’s life experience only bolstered his self-perceived responsibility for his children. He didn’t want to be like his father who abandoned his own children for a selfish cause.</p>
<p>Jian Wendi was willing to do everything for his descendants. He was a good father and a proper ancestor, trying to protect his descendants for generations to come.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I will keep your words deep in my mind.” Longwei bowed with great reverence.</p>
<p>“I have to go now.” Li Qiye looked back at the mountain range with yearning sentiments. Then, he casually pointed forward to open a portal and quickly crossed through many territories.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In recent days, there had been sudden changes at the Dragon Demon Sea. A black star came out of nowhere and crossed the sky with great speed like a falling meteor. Because it was too swift, the void shattered and issued bursts of explosions.</p>
<p>This meteor was followed by a skeletal horse whose speed was no lesser than the star itself. The horse continued to maintain a certain distance behind this meteor. This bizarre scene attracted the attention of many cultivators in this region.</p>
<p>What was even more concerning was that when this meteor crossed the sky, the skeletons in the nearby vicinity would begin to move. Some of them seemed to have been granted life and began to crawl.</p>
<p>However, after the meteor disappeared over the horizon, the skeletons would lose their strength and fall apart once more, scattering all over the ground.</p>
<p>This was quite a creepy spectacle and frightened all the nearby cultivators. Some experts and even seclusive ancestors had no choice but to pay attention to this event. Many speculations and theories arose.</p>
<p>“Maybe this is a demon star that will bring about a calamity to the Dragon Demon Sea. After all, only a devilish star such as this would be able to revive the dead.” Plenty of big shots were worried.</p>
<p>Of course, a few ancestors were ecstatic. Their eyes flashed after seeing the moving skeletons powered by the star, and some even murmured: “This star can revive skeletons. Perhaps there is an immortal item within that will allow people to become eternal!”</p>
<p>In fact, many ancestors reached this conclusion. For those on the verge of death like them, nothing was more tempting than eternal life. The appearance of this black star gave them hope.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, the ancestors of many sea god and imperial lineages came out one after another. They thought about pursuing this black star.</p>
<p>Soon, news regarding the location of this star was spread. Someone personally saw it fly into the Bonesea with a skeletal horse right behind it.</p>
<p>“Into the Bonesea?” A big character murmured while his eyes sparkled: “Does the Bonesea really have an item that grants immortality?”</p>
<p>Another answered: “Maybe this is the case.”</p>
<p>After coming up with this possibility, these ancestors became unbelievably excited, like chickens with their heads cut off. They all excitedly stated: “There are so many tempting items in there. It looks like the momentum of the age is about to change, an item that can grant immortality is about to appear.”</p>
<p>“An immortal artifact is coming into being at the Bonesea!” Someone released this news to the entire region.</p>
<p>An item that could grant immortality was mouth-watering. Many ancestors would be driven even crazier with such a thing. This news turned into a storm that swept up all the experts nearby. Heaven Spirit itself was affected. The powerful inhabitants of the Abyss and Jade Seas immediately departed for the Dragon Demon Sea and headed straight for the Bonesea.</p>
<p>Even the rare existences that had been buried under the earth since the dawn of time were startled after hearing this news.</p>
<p>An ancient existence calmed down and murmured: “Who is the mastermind?”</p>
<p>Even though this particular existence didn’t know the real mysteries behind the Bonesea, they had heard stories about it, legends, even.</p>
<p>They immediately understood that there was a puppet master behind all of this. However, the exact reason for these events eluded them.</p>
<p>This was precisely why these near-death existences didn’t want to come into being even after hearing about this immortal artifact. Whether it was real or not, they didn’t dare to be involved.</p>
<p>Only truly powerful existences like them understood that very few in this world would dare to concoct such a plan.</p>
<p>This was a level beyond them, an even more fearsome type of existence that belonged only in legends. Despite being unstoppable for so long, they were unwilling to mess with such an existence because it might bring extinction to their race.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1289: Rootless Duckweed</h4>
<p>Chapter 1289: Rootless Duckweed</p>
<p>Li Qiye left the dragon mountains for the Bonesea. He wasn’t in a hurry, so he opened his portals randomly while crossing through the countries.</p>
<p>He stopped multiple times along the way to bask in the beautiful sceneries of the Dragon Demon Sea. After all, these majestic scenes were unique to Heaven Spirit.</p>
<p>He had heard about the immortal artifact coming out of the Bonesea and only smiled in response.</p>
<p>Seeing people anxiously running there didn’t affect his pace because he knew that the time was not ripe. Only when it was would he finally be able to reach his desired destination. Otherwise, it would all be in vain.</p>
<p>Because of this, he relaxed and took his time traveling across this beautiful sea region. However, he would occasionally become absent-minded in front of this beauty. While standing on a cliff and gazing at the vast sea, his mind seemed to drift away.</p>
<p>In those distant years, there was a period of time when he had a taste of the happiness of being an ordinary man. During an evening on this very cliff, there was someone who held hands with him while watching the sunset.</p>
<p>He continued to look at the sun slowly sinking into the sea in a stupor. After a long time, he withdrew his gaze and gave a carefree smile: “Yueli, I’ll let you know that someone named Li Qiye is back. I don’t mind even if you kill me. All debts must be repaid before I go to the final world.”</p>
<p>With that, he laughed with an open mind before coolly leaving. Sometimes he would fly or ride the waves.</p>
<p>Among the billowing clouds were a few mountains and old pavilions. This scene looked just like an immortal paradise. Among these hidden mountains were lush, ancient pines and gurgling streams.</p>
<p>In the pavilions were cultivators absorbing and releasing the elements as if they were immortals.</p>
<p>When standing in these clouds, one would often see other cultivators traveling. When they met, it was a time to be cheerful and enthusiastic. Honorifics were thrown and greetings were exchanged. They would explore the arts of the elements.</p>
<p>These scenes looked particularly beautiful, but the truth was far from this. Behind these dream-like images was an unimaginable cruelty.</p>
<p>These cultivators hiding in the clouds belonged to the human race. Moreover, their situation was one of helplessness.</p>
<p>In the Heaven Spirit World, continents were far and few between; most landmasses already had masters. Cultivators didn’t mind being in oceans. At a certain level, there was virtually no difference between land and water. However, humans were land creatures. More often than not, they weren't suited for the sea, unlike the sea tribes who had a love for the oceans and were born there.</p>
<p>Some human cultivators had no territory, so they had to stay in the sky and hide in the clouds. These mountains and pavilions weren’t personally refined by them but instead were left behind by their ancestors. Of course, the lucky ones could come across places without an owner.</p>
<p>The abandoned mountains and pavilions were often lineages that failed to be passed down. Their final generation must have died from old age. Thus, the structures could only float in the clouds across the vast firmament. The lucky ones could then claim these as their own.</p>
<p>When human cultivators reached a certain power level and didn’t have a landmass, they would dig out mud and soil from the ocean or move a mountain in order to refine them. This process would eventually turn into these artificial creations floating among the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>The truth was that it wasn’t their choice. Who would want to drift endlessly in the sky if they had their own land?</p>
<p>For some people, this style of life was very interesting and fun at the start. However, as time passed, they would come to find that they were not the masters of their own destiny.</p>
<p>Given the choice between having a home and this, no one would want to be rootless duckweed. Moreover, it was dangerous to drift around like this. Once they met an enemy who was more powerful than themselves, they could be destroyed at any time.</p>
<p>This dreamy life was the result of a lack of choice. In this kind of rootless drifting, one wouldn’t have any way of establishing an ancestral ground, mining resources, or planting precious elixirs and plants.</p>
<p>Being poor was a fatal disadvantage for cultivators. A wealth of resources was crucial for cultivators and sects to grow stronger.</p>
<p>However, having an abundance of these resources relied on having one’s own territory in order to keep them safe. It was often meaningless to have too many resources while participating in this vagabond lifestyle. Having a pavilion in the air was simply a fool’s dream.</p>
<p>Li Qiye gently shook his head while looking at a few of the cultivators visiting and talking to each other among these mountains and pavilions in the middle of this sea of clouds.</p>
<p>In this helpless situation, these humans could only rely on each other for support. Otherwise, they would be easily washed away by the flood.</p>
<p>“This simply cannot be a place for humans to live.” This was Li Qiye’s only comment.</p>
<p>How many could be lucky enough to have their own landmass like the Exquisite Valley or Dongting Lake? Very few could enjoy being born into such a great background. To be able to join those sects was also a type of fortune.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he didn’t feel too sad about it. In his eyes, everyone had their own path. Even a savior couldn’t save everyone.</p>
<p>He went on his way, riding the ocean waves without a care.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, where are you going? Do you want my company?” A pleasant voice rang with a hint of allurement that could stir the heart.</p>
<p>Li Qiye glanced over and saw Liu Ruyan standing on a boat. She was basking in the breeze with her slender figure like a willow leaf, making others truly get a sense for the fluttering wind.</p>
<p>She was riding a gigantic ship with the symbol of the Void Imperfection Three Schools on it. In Heaven Spirit, everyone would show some respect for this symbol.</p>
<p>Li Qiye smiled and got on the ship instead of refusing.</p>
<p>She showed warm hospitality by moving a table over before proceeding to light some sandalwood scents. Next, she boiled tea and personally handed it to him.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to mind the gesture and casually lied down by the table, looking quite comfortable.</p>
<p>She smiled and handed him a teacup while saying: “Young Noble, my craft is not as good as my sister’s, please don’t laugh.”</p>
<p>Though her face was hidden behind a thin veil, each of her frowns and smiles exuded a special and comforting charm.</p>
<p>Gongsun Meiyu was also an enchanting person, but her charm was different. Meiyu had the mature allure of a married woman. Her charm relied on her beauty and her beauty relied on a sense of lust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ruyan’s charm was much more refined. It seeped into the heart with a touch of elegance and youthfulness. Such a woman was to be adored by all men.</p>
<p>He accepted the tea and slowly took a sip while staring at her without saying anything.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, are you going to the Bonesea?” She showed a smile that would make hearts flutter: “I’m also going to the Bonesea, may I accompany you?”</p>
<p>He responded while faintly grinning: “You are well-informed.”</p>
<p>She frankly said: “Young Noble, you are a dragon among men, a supreme prodigy. Many eyes are on you regardless of the time or place as you’re just like a swan among a flock of chickens. Your location can easily be found by asking around a bit.”</p>
<p>“Little beauty, I don’t care what your plan is, but don’t provoke me or I might just avail myself of your charm.” Li Qiye was in a particularly good mood while looking at this attractive woman.</p>
<p>“Do you actually dare?” Ruyan responded with a teasing chuckle: “There’s no need for you to do so. If you want, I am more than willing to join you in bed. Of course, if you have some unusual tastes, I can also entertain you in that manner.”</p>
<p>Such words truly pulled on one’s heartstrings and made blood boil, especially when they came from someone as devilishly lovely as Liu Ruyan.</p>
<p>“Well said!” Li Qiye’s eyes widened as he suddenly pulled her closer in an overbearing manner. She couldn’t respond in time for he was too fast in taking her into his embrace.</p>
<p>“Pa! Pa! Pa!” A series of slaps resounded. Liu Ruyan cried out in surprise as Li Qiye slapped her sweet buttocks repeatedly.</p>
<p>He showed no sign of mercy for the fairer sex and used great force on her soft and pretty behind. She was definitely feeling a burning pain!</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1290: Martial Sisters</h4>
<p>Chapter 1290: Martial Sisters</p>
<p>“You!” Liu Ruyan resembled a cat that had its tail stepped on, instantly jumping back. She glared at Li Qiye with both fear and embarrassment. Even though her speech was bold, innocence was still part of her nature.</p>
<p>What frustrated her even more was that Li Qiye showed no mercy at all. Her butt was burning with pain, especially if she sat down.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat back and glanced at the girl to say: “I’m not someone you can tease as you please. I’ll even strip you for a public display, what do you say about that?”</p>
<p>She gave him a fierce look and angrily replied: “Do you not know how to be a gentleman at all?”</p>
<p>As the Evil Devourer Schoolmaster, she enjoyed a high position in the Heaven Spirit World. Moreover, she herself was enchantingly beautiful, enough so to sway the soul of any man. It could be said that she was a demoness at the level of a calamity, a moon surrounded by the stars in the eyes of men.</p>
<p>No man had ever been this rude to her, but today, Li Qiye was both rude and unmerciful.</p>
<p>“Gentleman?” He smiled, revealing his perfectly white teeth: “Of course I know how to be a gentleman, but that depends on who I’m dealing with.”</p>
<p>Despite her frustration, there was nothing she could do about it. She was aware of his notoriety from having killed beauties like Gongsun Meiyu and Shangguan Feiyan without any mercy at all. It was no longer surprising for this fierce man to do whatever he wished.</p>
<p>She sat back down but felt a stinging pain, causing her to frown.</p>
<p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile after seeing her expression: “It looks like I was a bit too rough.”</p>
<p>The remark sounded quite sarcastic.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you are aware.” She glared at him again without losing any of her charm.</p>
<p>He seemed to be enjoying her presence, evident by his smile. This, in turn, made her embarrassed as shown by her giving him the side-eye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored her stare and took his time enjoying the tea before speaking: “This tea from your Evil Devourer School is quite good, but to be honest, your charming demeanor is even better than this tea.”</p>
<p>Who knows if this remark was meant as praise or mockery. Meanwhile, she elegantly poured a full cup of tea for him, rendering a very pleasurable scene.</p>
<p>She sat there quietly as he drank the tea. Although she was still, she exuded a different style of attractiveness.</p>
<p>After finishing the cup, he looked at her and cheerfully asked: “What do you want?”</p>
<p>She poured another cup for him in a very comforting style and revealed a smile that would cause the body to go soft: “To steal my senior sister’s man, is that alright? All the elders in the sect want her to bear your child in order to spread your bloodline.”</p>
<p>“All because of the imperial bloodline?” He couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>She playfully smirked and blinked her eyes: “I heard that outside of our progenitor, no one else from our school was able to become a true whale rider. If your bloodline is passed down, we might gain a new rider.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled in response. He understood this very well since their schools didn’t only want an imperial bloodline, these ancestors sought another whale rider.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Qiye changed the topic: “I heard your sister had married.”</p>
<p>She replied: “I am different from her. She always placed the school first to the point of sacrificing herself. However, she is also the ideal wife in the minds of men. Elegant, noble, sensible, understanding, wise but not overbearing... which man wouldn’t like her?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye teased: “Aren’t you jealous?”</p>
<p>She chuckled in response: “Why would I be? She has her path and I have mine. Instead of being a virtuous wife like her, I prefer to be rebellious. The path of the grand dao is arduous. It isn’t easy being a cultivator, so why should anyone burden themselves with so many responsibilities? Be free and true to your desires, that’s how it should be.”</p>
<p>He was amused by her answer as he looked at her. She felt no apprehension under his stare and instead met it directly.</p>
<p>“Be free and true to your desires, well said.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>“I might not be a proper schoolmaster, but I’m definitely a proper cultivator.” She smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can reconsider.” She playfully winked: “I heard some men have a particular penchant for married women. The more powerful they are, the more unimaginable their tastes are. Even though my sister was a married woman, she is still a virgin and absolutely suitable for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m fully aware of what kind of woman is suitable for me.” He smiled in response: “Your so-called competing against your sister is only a facade for you to help her.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” She winked once more and provocatively smiled while lightheartedly saying: “Not necessarily, a man like you is very attractive, enough to fascinate young girls. It isn’t strange for me to compete against her.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” He leisurely replied: “If the old men from your schools want something from me, fine, I’ll fulfill their wish. If both your sister and yourself warm my bed, I will consider it.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Young Noble, you have quite an appetite, wanting to hit two swans with one arrow... Holding beauties from both sides to fully enjoy the pleasure of men.” She smiled: “That’s quite an ambition you have there.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye faintly smiled: “I said I’m only reconsidering. The one losing out in this deal is me.”</p>
<p>She took another glance at this nonchalant man ahead of her and sentimentally sighed: “A confident man is so attractive, you’re truly swaying my heart.”</p>
<p>“Alright little beauty, there’s no need to goad me.” Li Qiye said: “Let your senior sister come out, your tricks aren’t fooling anyone.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, Zhuo Jianshi emerged from within the boat. She bowed before him and sincerely said: “Excuse us again. If we have done anything foolish, please punish us.”</p>
<p>Her attitude was very sincere as she maintained a very low posture. Nevertheless, she was still incredibly elegant and had a hint of sexiness. It was quite difficult to not like someone such as her, especially when her soft and silky voice entered one’s ears; they would feel quite comfortable upon hearing her voice.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not from your school, so there’s no need for this type of formality and punishment.” He gently waved his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, you are discerning with matchless wisdom, nothing can elude you.” Liu Ruyan smiled: “But this isn’t my sister’s fault. It was my idea, so if you want to blame someone, blame me.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye only looked at the two of them since he didn’t really mind: “Even your three schools do not make exceptions for you two?”</p>
<p>Zhuo Jianshi was hesitant to respond as she was unsure how to phrase it. In the end, she chose to stay silent.</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan movingly smiled instead: “It can’t be helped. At times, cultivators are unable to escape their responsibilities. If you don’t mind, how about leaving your bloodline with us? It will be a meritorious deed.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the two and smiled: “Who will be waiting first? Or will both of you come together?”</p>
<p>Such directness left Jianshi feeling hot. Even though the upper echelons of the schools wished for this, she was still a girl, so she inevitably became embarrassed when faced with this problem.</p>
<p>Ruyan fared better as she was still smiling: “It is okay if you want to have both of us.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye lightly laughed before answering: “Forget it, there’s no need to talk about this matter. Go back and tell the old geezers to give up on this idea. I won’t casually have children or leave behind my bloodline for your schools.”</p>
<p>With that, he stood up, intending to leave.</p>
<p>Jianshi softly sighed after hearing this response. What could she do about it? She understood that a man like Li Qiye wasn’t so easily tempted by women.</p>
<p>“If you are going to the Bonesea, why don’t we go together?” Ruyan chuckled: “Or are you afraid of being seduced by our charm so you don’t dare to be close to us?”</p>
<p>“Really now?” He looked at her and actually sat back down: “Fine, I want to see just what kind of charm the two of you possess.”</p>
<p>He naturally knew that this was her way of goading him, but he still stayed in the end.</p>
<p>She boldly told Jianshi: “Big Sis, since Young Noble is staying, shouldn’t we be offering our services like giving him a massage?”</p>
<p>Jianshi instantly turned red. Even though she had agreed with the ancestors in the sect and was prepared to sacrifice herself, this was still her first time serving a man.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1291: Two Beauties In Waiting</h4>
<p>Chapter 1291: Two Beauties In Waiting</p>
<p>Li Qiye was pleasantly occupied while staring at the elegant and bashful Jianshi. He leisurely said: “Okay, come give me a shoulder massage.”</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment before moving behind him to give him a massage. This was a first for her, so her actions were quite jerky. Nevertheless, a touch as gentle as water still left room for enjoyment.</p>
<p>Ruyan smiled and poured more tea for Li Qiye with a smooth, flowing style that was quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the gentle Jianshi and then the seductive Ruyan before commenting with emotion: “To tell the truth, I’m a bit envious of your Void Imperfection Schools. No matter the situation, it is always of the same heart. Despite being divided into three schools, the disciples have unusual solidarity. This is definitely a rare matter.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble, your remark is mistaken.” Ruyan chuckled: “Even though I’m helping her right now, discord and competition plagued our youth.”</p>
<p>He faintly smiled: “Is that so?”</p>
<p>In fact, the school wanted Jianshi to keep Li Qiye back. Even though she was the main actor and Ruyan was the assistant, the two of them still had a great relationship. Even though they had conflicting views at times and competed against each other, they were still martial sisters who loved each other. Minor things like arguing and fighting didn’t affect their true relationship.</p>
<p>For instance, right now. Jianshi was a wise and elegant woman, but she was still very inexperienced and lacked the boldness overflowing in Ruyan. The latter was the one who could help her keep Li Qiye back.</p>
<p>“Competition is a good thing. A sect without competition will stagnate. Competition on top of great comradery, nothing is more precious than this.” Li Qiye enjoyed the massage and commented: “Your ancestors did a good job of passing down such a big lineage. It would be difficult for a sect with these characteristics to not last for a long time. Regardless of the era, your sect has always been an enviable existence.”</p>
<p>He was only stating the truth. Among the powerful lineages in the Heaven Spirit World, the three schools rarely showed themselves. However, they didn’t weaken, their strength remained a deterrence against the rest of the lineages.</p>
<p>Jianshi softly spoke while massaging Li Qiye: “Young Noble, if you will it, the Void Imperfection School will be yours.” Her words were gentle like water, making others want to drown in them.</p>
<p>“Are you really willing?” He looked up to meet her countenance only inches away and smiled.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t deceive you.” She hesitated for a moment then met his gaze with her limpid autumn water eyes: “In the past, I really didn’t want to marry you, but after interacting with you more, this marriage wouldn’t be insulting to me at all. In fact, I would be the one reaching above my post.”</p>
<p>“People from the Void Imperfection School are indeed wise.” Li Qiye smiled but shook his head: “Void Imperfection has its own fate while I have mine. If your ancestor was still in this world, I’m afraid she wouldn’t want to see it tied to my war chariot, so forget about this matter.”</p>
<p>Anyone else would be excited to no end after hearing about the possibility of grasping this great authority. At that point, beauties and power would come too easily. Who wouldn’t desire these things?</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye didn’t care for it since it wasn’t what he desired, even though Void Imperfection would give him plenty.</p>
<p>Plus, he didn’t want to involve the school in his personal goals. Even though Immortal Emperor Wu Gou wasn’t his student, the emperor still respected him. Because of this, he was even more hesitant to break the school’s serenity. [1. The author used “she” earlier, so this is a female Immortal Emperor, but until it is explicitly stated, neutral will still be used.]</p>
<p>Jianshi gently sighed after seeing his demeanor. She knew that this man had no interest in their schools’ power. A man capable of keeping calm when tempted by power was incredibly unfathomable. This only made him even more frightening.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about such boring topics.” Ruyan smiled: “May I ask if you are going to the Bonesea for the item of immortality?”</p>
<p>It was time for Ruyan to lend Jianshi a hand by diverting the conversation away from the refusal.</p>
<p>“The immortal item?” He smiled and shook his head: “I don't pursue immortality. Plus, the Bonesea doesn't necessarily have it.”</p>
<p>Ruyan replied: “I heard many people are going there with this goal. Even a few Godkings from the previous generation are coming into being. Gu Chun’s four branches, the Roaring Conch, the Seven Martial Pavilion, and the Dream Empyrean — these behemoths are all going for the artifact. If you are not aiming for it, why are you going?”</p>
<p>He chuckled: “Let me ask you that instead, why are you two going?”</p>
<p>Ruyan winked in response: “We are going because of you. Just who is it that made you so charming? Others have no choice but to chase after you.”</p>
<p>He gently shook his head and said: “Hahahaha, I do enjoy listening to such flattery, but don’t go too crazy in front of me, little beauty.”</p>
<p>“We came in search for the skeletal horse.” Jianshi spoke softly into his ears. It was a very pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>She continued: “Our ancient scrolls have recorded certain rumors about how Immortal Emperor Bu Si had a mount when he was still alive — a skeletal horse. However, this horse completely disappeared later on. The emperor’s destruction was very mysterious, so now when this horse appeared out of nowhere, we are curious to see what is going on.”</p>
<p>“Your speculation is right.” Li Qiye nodded: “The horse is indeed Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s mount. To be exact, it was only his mount during his youth. Later on after Bu Si became an emperor, the mount was hidden away to never be ridden again.”</p>
<p>Ruyan immediately became interested and asked: “Why was it hidden away?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the two and chuckled: “There are several different legends about this. One states that it has something to do with the emperor’s origin. Another believes that it has something to do with his ultimate end because he had been unkillable for so long. And lastly, some people think he is still trying to reincarnate.”</p>
<p>“Reincarnate?” Both Ruyan and Jianshi were moved after hearing this. Reincarnation was, in fact, another form of immortality. It was just that the method was different.</p>
<p>However, all of them had one similarity — no one was known to have succeeded. Many cultivators believed in reincarnation as part of the cosmic cycle, but no one knew whether it was real or not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this mysterious emperor had always been a hot topic. So now, when Li Qiye brought up reincarnation, the two girls were naturally surprised.</p>
<p>Ruyan winked her alluring eyes and asked: “Which theory is most likely correct in your mind?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at her with one eye and replied: “There’s no need to rope me into answering. Plus, even if I knew the truth, I wouldn’t necessarily let you know.”</p>
<p>She coquettishly responded: “I’m only asking casually, why do you have to be so cautious?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled: “For the two of you, the Bonesea is still worth the trip. If you are lucky, you might be able to find your Void Imperfection School’s Windchase Break!”</p>
<p>“What?!” Both of them cried out loud. Ruyan’s hands that were holding the teapot were trembling; tea almost spilled out of the pot. Jianshi also stopped her massage and opened her eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Jianshi excitedly stated: “Are you saying that our Windchase Break was lost at the Bonesea?!”</p>
<p>Although others once claimed that their three schools had the most immortal physique laws, they had lost one of the most important things, an immortal physique strike!</p>
<p>The Windchase Break was the attack created by Immortal Emperor Wu Gou. It was considered the strongest attack of their school.</p>
<p>However, they lost it later on. Juniors like the two girls didn’t know how it went missing.</p>
<p>Whenever their disciples toured the world, they would keep an eye out for clues about this attack. Nevertheless, nothing had ever turned up. Thus, Li Qiye’s revelation was a pleasant surprise to the two of them.</p>
<p>“Is our Windchase Break really there in the Bonesea?” Ruyan’s eyes flared up as she stared at Li Qiye in astonishment.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Ruyan calmed down and actually brought the cup next to Li Qiye’s lips this time instead of just handing him the cup. Meanwhile, Jianshi gently began to massage his shoulders again.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1292: Lithodidae Overlord</h4>
<p>Chapter 1292: Lithodidae Overlord</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the two and gleefully said: “It is indeed possible that your Windchase Break has fallen into the Bonesea.”</p>
<p>“How likely is it?” Even Jianshi, who has always been dignified and graceful, couldn’t contain herself.</p>
<p>Li Qiye took another sip of tea. He cleared his throat then smiled: “There’s no need to be so anxious, little beauty. Since I have said so, it means that the possibility is very high. If it isn’t one hundred percent, it would at least be eighty or ninety percent…”</p>
<p>Li Qiye abruptly stopped at this point. His eyes flashed while looking outside.</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were startled a bit, but they quickly regained their wits. Both were true experts, so they exchanged a glance before looking outside as well.</p>
<p>Ruyan coldly glared at the bottom of the boat and declared: “Roll out here, whoever is hiding below.”</p>
<p>Jianshi also realized that someone was hiding under the boat, so she became much more cautious.</p>
<p>With that, a figure climbed up from the boat’s hull. He slightly wobbled forward after getting on.</p>
<p>It was an old man dressed in gray. He was not especially tall, but his arms were very muscular and powerful. They looked like they would be a match for dragon claws.</p>
<p>Anyone would be convinced that these arms had the power to move mountains and flip seas with their infinite might.</p>
<p>But there was something even more eye-catching than his arms. He had a wooden coffin on his shoulders. It looked ordinary, but countless runes were engraved on it.</p>
<p>His powerful arms were holding onto it for dear life, as if it was a supreme treasure. At the same time, he was stained with blood and wounds from a multitude of weapons. Some arrows were still stuck in his body.</p>
<p>It was a human, so after seeing his own kin, he was glad and stumbled forward. His legs turned weak as he kneeled on the deck.</p>
<p>“Young Noble, please save me!” He was panting heavily after shouting his request as if the words had used up all of his strength.</p>
<p>An old man covered in wounds came out of nowhere with a wooden coffin. No logical person would take him in. Ruyan and Jianshi glanced at each other before looking at this old man.</p>
<p>Li Qiye was also staring at him. To be exact, he was looking at the wooden coffin. His eyes were attracted to it as if there was a supreme treasure or beauty inside. He didn’t look away for a very long time.</p>
<p>Their boat slowly stopped. Both girls slightly frowned and knew that something was about to happen.</p>
<p>Ruyan grimaced and asked: “Why have we stopped?”</p>
<p>“Schoolmaster, the Lithodidae Overlord’s battleship is in front of us. He wishes to board.” The disciple controlling the boat reported with haste.</p>
<p>“Lithodidae Overlord.” This name made Jianshi furrow her brows as she spoke: “His notoriety can’t be overstated.”</p>
<p>With that, she glanced at the kneeling old man. His body froze and was even shivering after hearing this title. Even though he tried his best to control his emotions, he couldn’t fool the two girls.</p>
<p>They didn’t make a decision and instead turned towards Li Qiye. Without a doubt, they were waiting for him to decide.</p>
<p>After a while, Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and returned to his chair before lazily saying: “Let him board.”</p>
<p>After hearing Li Qiye’s approval, Ruyan immediately ordered the disciples: “Let him up.”</p>
<p>The old man anxiously shouted: “Young Noble, please, please save me since we are both kindred spirits. Save both the old and young!” He was quite frightened.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled without promising or refusing the old man. He quietly sat there and stared at the old man with great interest.</p>
<p>A short moment later, a person boarded the ship. Before he even arrived, a huge shadow was cast on the deck. In the blink of an eye, a burly man appeared in sight.</p>
<p>He had the aura of a tyrannical king that could look down on the entire world. He wore a tight robe, showing off the details of his muscles. His body was surging with power, especially when he clenched his fists, lightning seemed to run through his entire being.</p>
<p>He resembled a mad dragon that could destroy the world anytime.</p>
<p>His forehead was covered with markings, making him look like a giant crab. Although they made him uglier, they also added to his vicious yet regal aura.</p>
<p>The Lithodidae Overlord was a famous ruler at the Dragon Demon Sea from the Regal Valley. This was a lineage everyone knew in this region. It was created by the Lithodidae Sea God, someone who lived during the generation of Immortal Emperor Yin Long, the most recent sea god in history.</p>
<p>His notoriety was not only built on his ancestor's shadow. He himself was quite powerful and stood out even in the vast Dragon Demon Sea. Of course, the reason for his infamy was not his strength, but rather his ruthlessness. He would massacre someone’s entire race for opposing him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he also enjoyed hunting famous people and young talents with great potential even if they didn’t provoke him. In fact, he had a penchant for hunting rare races as well.</p>
<p>He enjoyed certain abnormal acts such as taking their heads or other precious things as trophies.</p>
<p>He had hunted enemies more powerful than himself and even poisonous and ferocious creatures. More often than not, it wouldn’t be through a head-on confrontation since he was a man of subterfuge. Traps and outnumbering his quarry were some of the methods he would employ in his hunt.</p>
<p>Moreover, he himself greatly enjoyed the process. Because of this, he was notorious. Few would dare to provoke him since the Regal Valley was mighty as well.</p>
<p>“So it is Schoolmaster Zhuo and Schoolmaster Liu. Excuse my sudden visit.” He cupped his fist after seeing the two girls.</p>
<p>Despite his polite gesture, his eyes showed flashes of desire after seeing the two beauties. Of course, he hid it quite well.</p>
<p>Ruyan sat right next to Li Qiye while Jianshi was still giving his back a massage.</p>
<p>“Lithodidae Overlord, long time no see.” Ruyan gently nodded without moving.</p>
<p>Even though he was a wicked tyrant, in terms of strength, status, and influence, he was no match for Ruyan and Jianshi. The Regal Valley was inferior to the Void Imperfection Three Schools as well.</p>
<p>His eyes fell upon Li Qiye, but he didn’t recognize the youth so he turned towards the kneeling old man. He immediately asked the two girls: “Schoolmasters, this person is a traitor to our Regal Valley. He stole our supreme treasure and fled. We have chased him all the way here, so I hope Schoolmasters will hand this traitor over to us. We shall give him a fair and just trial.”</p>
<p>“Schoolmasters, I, I am not a traitor to the Regal Valley and I definitely didn’t steal any treasure from them since I’m a vagabond. Schoolmasters, Young Noble, you must believe me!” The old man grew nervous after hearing the overlord, so he quickly defended himself.</p>
<p>“Schoolmasters, don’t listen to his lies, he is adept at deceiving others.” The overlord replied: “If you don’t believe me, you can go to our Regal Valley to verify…”</p>
<p>“He’ll stay.” At this time, Li Qiye casually told the overlord: “You can leave now.”</p>
<p>The overlord’s expression turned stiff after hearing this response. However, he put on a smile and cupped his fist towards Li Qiye: “May I know your name?”</p>
<p>With characters like the two women serving the youth, the overlord didn’t dare to show contempt. He thought that this might be an ancestor of the three schools.</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye casually stated his name. His eyes were on the coffin; he seemed to be particularly interested in the runes.</p>
<p>“So it is Young Noble Li, your prestige has spread quite far. I have been your admirer for a long time.” The overlord inwardly quivered after hearing this name. He finally knew just what kind of person he had encountered.</p>
<p>Recently, Li Qiye’s fierce fame soared like a dragon to let him become the number one among the younger generation of the humans. His fame had even caught up with the Seashield Prince, the Martial Goddess, and the Profound Monarch.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only casually acknowledged the compliments with a hum. He didn’t even bother to look at the overlord.</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li, this man is a traitor to our valley and is holding our supreme treasure…” The overlord was quite dissatisfied with Li Qiye’s arrogant attitude, but he managed to endure his annoyance.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1293: Xiong Qianbei</h4>
<p>Chapter 1293: Xiong Qianbei</p>
<p>Li Qiye interrupted him and dismissively said: “People from the Xiong Clan have never been disciples of the Regal Valley. Don’t play tricks in front of me.”</p>
<p>The overlord was taken aback after hearing this while the old man echoed: “Young Noble, you are right, I’ve never been their valley’s disciple, he is trying to frame me.”</p>
<p>The overlord’s expression turned a bit ugly, but he quickly restored his smile: “Young Noble Li, your words are a bit too arbitrary…”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been an arbitrary person.” Li Qiye interrupted him and flatly asserted: “This person is now under my protection, leave.”</p>
<p>The overlord’s expression dimmed as a fierce flash streaked across his eyes, but he still maintained his friendly demeanor: “I have always respected the heroes of all races, and the same goes for your prestige. If Young Noble Li and the schoolmasters wish to protect this traitor, then I will give you some face and no longer pursue this matter.”</p>
<p>This reply was quite generous and sensible. Anyone else would feel their days brighten up. To be given such respect was a kind of honor.</p>
<p>However, Li Qiye was still as cold as before. From start to finish, he didn’t even give the overlord a single glance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overlord didn’t become angry. He bid his farewell with a smile: “Young Noble Li, Schoolmasters, this is goodbye for now. However, with the world as small as it is, I hope that everyone will come visit my Regal Valley one day. I will surely show you my greatest hospitality.”</p>
<p>“Valley Lord, you are too polite.” Ruyan and Jianshi were still courteous. As lords of their sects, they naturally had to act gracefully.</p>
<p>Li Qiye, on the other hand, was completely indifferent. His attitude would make others think that he was overbearingly arrogant.</p>
<p>The overlord smiled and left in a cool manner.</p>
<p>Ruyan chuckled after he left: “Young Noble, you are now on that guy’s list, and he will never let go of his prey. He’s a brute famous for wanting to hunt people stronger than him. You are the rising rookie of the human race, and since you have opposed him, you are now the prime candidate on his list.”</p>
<p>“Then let him come and die.” Li Qiye simply didn’t give a damn about the overlord’s pretentious and friendly act.</p>
<p>He had seen countless people ranging from Immortal Emperors to nobodies. What kind of character had he not met? How could the overlord’s little play elude his eyes?</p>
<p>The old man felt that he found a path to survival after hearing Li Qiye’s nonchalant and confidence-filled statement. He quickly prostrated on the ground to say: “Young Noble, thank you for saving my life. This lowly one will never forget your kindness.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Schoolmasters, for being on the side of righteousness.” He bowed to the two girls as well.</p>
<p>Ruyan responded with a faint smile: “You sure know how to talk, putting the hat of being your saviors on our head. It looks like it will be difficult for us not to save you.”</p>
<p>The old man coughed, but he still shamelessly bowed before them. [1. If you accept the gesture, you have the responsibility to protect him because of face.]</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at the old man and asked: “What is your name?”</p>
<p>He quickly answered: “Young Noble, this lowly one’s name is Qianbei, a disciple of the Xiong Clan.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye lightly spoke: “The Xiong has fallen, they do not exist in the Heaven Spirit World any longer.”</p>
<p>Xiong Qianbei felt dejected after hearing this and replied with sorrow: “You are right, this little one is only a wandering ghost.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s attention was on the wooden coffin on the old man’s back. He lowered his tone: “Where did you get this coffin from?”</p>
<p>Both the girls became curious as well. Ever since the old man got here, Li Qiye’s eyes rarely left the coffin. They were curious about what the contents of the coffin could be to attract someone like Li Qiye who was indifferent to everything.</p>
<p>Qianbei was alarmed. He gripped the coffin even tighter while stumbling backward.</p>
<p>“Ah, Young Noble, these are the remains of my ancestor. I’m looking for a place to bury them.” He smiled wryly in response.</p>
<p>Li Qiye responded in a cold tone: “Old man, don’t play in front of me. Lying in my presence is a very unwise move. I can save you from the Lithodidae Overlord, but I can also smash you to pieces!”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about your life or whether you are human or a sea demon. Your background is of no interest to me either. I did it for the wooden coffin on your back.” Li Qiye’s eyes turned extremely cold: “If you can understand this, then do not lie in front of me or else you will come to understand what true horror is.”</p>
<p>Although Li Qiye didn’t emit a scary aura or a suppressive momentum, when his eyes turned cold, Qianbei couldn’t help but quiver. He felt chills all over his body while his legs grew weak.</p>
<p>Even masters like the two girls felt chills. A terrifying light flashed across his eyes, a glint capable of annihilating all things.</p>
<p>This was not an empty threat.</p>
<p>Qianbei struggled to calm down, but he managed to speak: “Young Noble, I, I picked up this coffin by chance. Several days ago when the black star was crossing the sky, I was at sea to find some clams for pearls and this coffin suddenly emerged from the sea.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye batted his eyes after hearing this. He tried to confirm: “Was there a strange phenomenon such as a chasm splitting open the seabed?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Qianbei was surprised. He didn’t hide it any longer: “That was indeed the case, the seabed suddenly split to form a deep trench when the dark star flew by, just like the Bottomless Trench in the Jade Sea. This coffin appeared and countless green branches pulled it out from the bottom. I was lucky enough to pick it up then…”</p>
<p>“... By the time I recomposed myself, the trench had disappeared. I didn’t really understand what the coffin was before meeting the overlord. He had been pursuing me all this way while I ran for dear life. Luckily Young Noble was here to save me.” He coughed at this point.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only listened to the first half while not caring about the second half of the story. His eyes fell upon the coffin once more.</p>
<p>Ruyan curiously asked Qianbei: “What is in the coffin?”</p>
<p>Qianbei honestly answered: “I don’t know either. I couldn’t open this coffin no matter what I tried.”</p>
<p>“These runes are very old, you won’t find any of them in this day and age.” Jianshi took a careful look at these indecipherable runes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these two came from the Void Imperfection Three Schools, an ancient lineage. As schoolmasters, they were quite knowledgeable compared to ordinary people. Nevertheless, they were completely unable to understand the meaning of these runes.</p>
<p>Li Qiye eventually told Qianbei: “I want this wooden coffin.”</p>
<p>Qianbei’s expression sank as he took several steps back. He was clearly very reluctant to accept this demand.</p>
<p>“Ah, Young Noble, well… about that…” Qianbei wryly smiled: “I, I need it to make a fortune!”</p>
<p>Ruyan chuckled in response: “You want to get rich from this? Don’t forget who saved your life. Can you try to become rich when you are dead?”</p>
<p>Qianbei became embarrassed after hearing this. He stood there awkwardly with a forced smile, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Li Qiye leisurely said: “If I take action, regardless of how strong you are or what aces you have hidden, you will still lose the coffin.”</p>
<p>Qianbei’s expression drastically changed again while he stumbled back even more, distancing himself further from Li Qiye. He awkwardly smiled: “This lowly one knows that you won’t rob me. I am indeed very grateful since you saved my life. It is, it is just that I have some predicaments, I hope you can understand.”</p>
<p>“I only saved your life because it was a convenient way to get this wooden coffin. Don’t worry about that, I won’t blackmail you just because of this favor.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively.</p>
<p>“I am ashamed before your noble bearing. If I can offer my service to you another day, I will do everything possible.” Qianbei relaxed after hearing this and quickly bowed again.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Li Qiye coldly looked at him and asked: “What kinds of things will make you willingly hand over this coffin?”</p>
<p>This question left Qianbei pondering. He looked at Li Qiye then the two girls while trying to find the right words.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1294: Wooden Coffin</h4>
<p>Chapter 1294: Wooden Coffin</p>
<p>“Speak, there are few items in this world that I can’t afford.” Li Qiye slowly said: “Of course, you need to act sensibly. Don’t push it and lose the opportunity.”</p>
<p>Both Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were very curious after seeing how much Li Qiye valued the coffin. What the hell was in this coffin?</p>
<p>Xiong Qianbei hesitated for a bit before biting his teeth and making up his mind: “I do not dare to be greedy after being shown such kindness by Young Noble. I, I want a piece of land.”</p>
<p>The two girls were surprised by this request. They both assumed Qianbei would want some treasures, elixirs or supreme merit laws, not a landmass.</p>
<p>“Do you know how precious a piece of land in Heaven Spirit is?” Jianshi shook her head. This was a world where land was more precious than anything else.</p>
<p>Qianbei replied: “This lowly one knows that. I won’t push my luck, I will be satisfied with a landmass around one hundred square miles.”</p>
<p>“You’re not pushing your luck by asking for a piece of land the size of one hundred square miles?” Ruyan couldn’t help but laugh while shaking her head: “Do you know how valuable this much land is in Heaven Spirit?”</p>
<p>Of course, a one hundred square mile piece of land was nothing in the other worlds. Even the minor branches of sects in those places would be much bigger. An ordinary disciple would be in charge of a territory of this size. However, land was too scarce in the Heaven Spirit World. This little piece of earth became especially precious here.</p>
<p>“A lot of second and third tier sects only have islands this big.” Jianshi gently shook her head.</p>
<p>“This old one knows.” Qianbei coughed in response: “However, this is a wooden coffin that incited a heavenly phenomenon. A meteor in the sky and a trench at the bottom of the sea — such a phenomenon is quite rare in this world. I believe this coffin is absolutely extraordinary, so I don’t think trading it for a one hundred square mile landmass is unreasonable.”</p>
<p>Ruyan grinned and said: “Even if it is worth the trade, you still need to have the power to handle it. You might be paying with your life before getting the chance to reap the benefits.”</p>
<p>She was telling the truth. If others knew that this coffin was truly worth a small island, many people would definitely try to rob him.</p>
<p>“Well…” Qianbei played the fool to avoid this question.</p>
<p>Li Qiye chuckled and flatly asked: “Even if I give you an island of that size, would you be able to keep it?”</p>
<p>Without sufficient strength, such a landmass would simply be a prize to compete for in Heaven Spirit. The old man could be robbed of it at any moment!</p>
<p>Qianbei solemnly answered: “Young Noble, I will try my best to guard it. If I have a piece of land, I will be able to reform my Xiong Clan. I shall treat it as my lifeblood.”</p>
<p>After seeing his serious demeanor, Li Qiye smiled and slowly said: “You desire a piece of land? So be it, I shall give it to you!”</p>
<p>“Really?” Qianbei couldn’t believe it. In fact, he didn’t place too much hope in this request. It was simply absurd, so Li Qiye accepting the trade made him think that this was a dream.</p>
<p>Li Qiye replied: “My words are made of gold, what I say shall be done.”</p>
<p>After hearing his resolute tone, Qianbei was ecstatic and quickly bowed: “Young Noble, this is giving us a new life. We shall remember your kindness for generations to come.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t care for such pleasantries and ordered: “Give me the coffin.”</p>
<p>“Well…” Qianbei hesitated. After all, he still hadn’t received the land yet, so he didn’t want to hand over the wooden coffin first.</p>
<p>Li Qiye continued: “Don’t worry, I said that I would give you a landmass, so I will when I’m done with my business.”</p>
<p>“Young Noble Li is a man of his word.” Jianshi added: “Our Sacred Spring School can guarantee you that he will give you what you want.”</p>
<p>“My Evil Devourer School will do the same, so you can rest assured.” Ruyan smiled as well.</p>
<p>Qianbei was glad to hear these two. They were both schoolmasters from an extremely reputable sect in Heaven Spirit. He could rest easy when these two put forth their guarantee for Li Qiye.</p>
<p>He hurriedly placed the coffin in front of Li Qiye and respectfully said: “Young Noble, the coffin is now yours.”</p>
<p>Having said that, he respectfully stood to the side. Li Qiye gave him the side-eye, but Qianbei didn’t react.</p>
<p>Liu Ruyan looked at him and teased: “What now, are you still afraid of not getting your land?”</p>
<p>Qianbei shamelessly stood there and smiled: “No, Schoolmaster, please don’t misunderstand me. I trust the young noble and you two schoolmasters as well. Ah, everyone must be going to the Bonesea this time, correct? I also want to go broaden my horizons. If you need an errand boy or a coolie, I am ready to serve.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye lazily looked at him and casually commented: “Such a shameless disciple has probably never appeared in the Xiong Clan until now.”</p>
<p>“Agh…” Qianbei’s face turned a bit hot, but he was too thick-skinned and continued to stand there while playing dumb.</p>
<p>Li Qiye ignored him and stood up. He circled around the coffin to carefully read the runes.</p>
<p>Ruyan curiously speculated: “What’s in it? Don’t tell me it is just a corpse.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s a treasury.” Qianbei couldn’t help but join in: “But how can you open it? I used all of my strength to hit it, but that didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to have a try.” Ruyan’s competitive nature rose. She stepped forward and placed both hands on the coffin while channeling her merit law. With her blood energy rising, a loud explosion ensued. She used a mighty force to lift it, aiming to remove the lid.</p>
<p>One must know that with her strength, she could easily overturn a mountain. Her going all out would result in an unimaginable power that could only be described by the phrase, “hating the earth for not having a circular handle.” [1. This is a peculiar phrase — hating the earth for not having a circular handle. It is describing someone with so much energy and power that if there was a handle for the earth, they could swing the earth around. The other part of this phrase is a hiltless heaven. Hiltless heaven and handleless earth — describing an overwhelming power.]</p>
<p>This force could tear apart the earth and rend the sky vault. However, even with her using all of her might, she couldn’t remove the lid of this coffin.</p>
<p>“How can this be?” To Ruyan’s astonishment, there wasn’t the slightest sign of damage or fingerprint on it. Showboating was not in her nature, but she was quite confident in her own power.</p>
<p>“Just what is this coffin?” Jianshi was shocked as well. They grew up and regularly competed against each other, so Jianshi understood Ruyan’s strength. Not even Godkings could stop characters of their level.</p>
<p>“This is beyond your comprehension.” Li Qiye smiled: “In terms of forcefully opening it, not to mention the two of you, even an Immortal Emperor might not be able to do it.”</p>
<p>This comment surprised both of the girls. What a monstrous claim! Anyone else would think that Li Qiye was just exaggerating, but they actually believed him.</p>
<p>“What the hell is inside?” Qianbei was completely drawn in. Even though he was the one who found the coffin, he didn’t know what was inside or what was so special about it.</p>
<p>“We’ll find out soon enough.” Li Qiye chuckled and placed his palm on the coffin, then he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>His palm remained unmoving. He didn’t release a crazy amount of blood energy or unstoppable laws and dao. It was simply him touching the coffin.</p>
<p>As moments passed, Li Qiye seemed to be caught in a deep sleep. Everyone else held their breaths; they didn’t want to break his concentration.</p>
<p>Even more time went on while the three remained completely quiet. Qianbei was a bit disappointed after thinking that this coffin might not be opened so easily.</p>
<p>However, at this very second, the runes came together to form the image of a tree of life. A majestic life force engulfed the area as if something was returning to life.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1295: Woman In The Coffin</h4>
<p>Chapter 1295: Woman In The Coffin</p>
<p>“Buzz.” The runes resembling a tree of life flashed. Next, they jumped into the coffin as if the tree wanted to take root within.</p>
<p>After their disappearance, one could hear a clank as if something was sliding within the coffin. Shortly afterward, the clicking of a lock could be heard. The tightly shut coffin suddenly came loose.</p>
<p>Qianbei excitedly blurted: “It’s open, it’s open!”</p>
<p>“What, how can this be? It opened just like that?” Ruyan was slack-jawed while staring at Li Qiye. She and Jianshi didn’t notice Li Qiye doing anything special.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only placed his palm on the coffin; he didn’t do anything, yet he was still able to open the coffin. This was simply inconceivable.</p>
<p>In fact, Qianbei wondered the same thing. He had the coffin for several days and used many methods in order to try and open it, but they all ended in failure.</p>
<p>But now, Li Qiye opened it in such a simple manner.</p>
<p>“This is not an ordinary coffin. It already had this form upon its inception, an object created by the heaven and earth. Brute force is of no use, so we have to do it like this.” Li Qiye pointed at his heart: “You must use your heart to feel and your mind to sense before awakening it. Only your heartbeat will let it know the location of life.”</p>
<p>These words were incredibly profound and inexplicable. The two girls carefully savored his teaching. As for Qianbei, even though he didn’t quite understand, he still did his best to memorize them.</p>
<p>With that, Li Qiye slowly opened the lid in a very gentle and cautious manner, as if the ultimate treasure was contained within.</p>
<p>The girls were very curious, so they inched closer in order to get a better look.</p>
<p>After seeing what was inside, both were gobsmacked with flaring eyes. They stared at the coffin in complete disbelief.</p>
<p>Qianbei thought that he was seeing things and rubbed his eyes. However, his vision was perfect. He murmured in shock: “Fairies do exist in this world...”</p>
<p>Ruyan emotionally commented: “The word ‘beauty’ is not enough to describe her…”</p>
<p>There was a very young woman lying inside the coffin, a beauty beyond the limits of the brush and ink.</p>
<p>Ruyan and Jianshi were ranked among the top beauties in Heaven Spirit. As schoolmasters, they didn’t rely on their beauty, but it was a source of pride for them. However, both of them were overshadowed by this woman.</p>
<p>Words failed to convey the sight of her lying in the coffin. Her beauty had reached an unrealistic level. Her ten slender fingers rested on her stomach. She slept soundly and peacefully; although there was no smile on her face, her demeanor made it seem as if she was having a good dream.</p>
<p>After a while, she slowly opened her eyes and eventually climbed out of the coffin, stupefying the three.</p>
<p>The girls were drowned in admiration and felt that her dream-like beauty did not belong in this world.</p>
<p>She was matchless and had a profound and immaculate gaze that stole the light from the celestials in the sky, causing them to be too ashamed to show themselves.</p>
<p>Her figure, with flawless curves, was out of this world. Even the most scrutinizing gaze would fail to find any flaws. Her body seemed to be one with the world, the most beautiful of all objects.</p>
<p>Her oval face was exquisitely stunning, an impeccable masterpiece of the heavens. Anyone who caught sight of it would be in awe and shock.</p>
<p>Even though she wore a plain white dress, this didn’t diminish her presence. She was someone who didn’t require any decoration, jewelry was simply superfluous.</p>
<p>This ordinary dress was the most suitable for her. Its simplistic style when adorned by her created the most beautiful charm.</p>
<p>Ruyan and Jianshi looked like two maids compared to her.</p>
<p>Among all of Li Qiye’s female acquaintances, Ming Yexue and Mei Suyao were one of a kind. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them the prettiest girls in their respective worlds.</p>
<p>However, they seemed to be missing a little something compared to this woman. It must be the elegant refinement that came from countless years.</p>
<p>She was a fairy of the ages, groomed for an eternity with the aura of time, empowered by the spirit of the world. She had a charm that others could never hope to attain. It was an innate aura. One either had it at birth or didn’t.</p>
<p>Jianshi couldn’t help but praise: “Such beautiful eyes!”</p>
<p>“It isn’t an exaggeration to call her the most beautiful in the nine worlds!” Ruyan was quite proud of her appearance, but she was full of admiration.</p>
<p>Qianbei was stupefied as he murmured: “She’s the most beautiful fairy in this world.”</p>
<p>In his eyes, she could only exist in dreams to be appreciated from a distance.</p>
<p>Among them, only Li Qiye remained normal. He wasn’t stunned by the beauty of the woman before him.</p>
<p>The woman looked at the group. She seemed to be slightly hazy. Eventually, she looked at Li Qiye and asked: “Was it you who woke me?”</p>
<p>Her voice was intoxicating; it was the sound of nature. The voices of the other two girls were quite alluring and pleasant as well, but there was still a great gap compared to this woman’s speech.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled and stretched out his hand to gently caress her face. Such an action was rude and befitted a cad. However, it seemed incredibly natural when performed by Li Qiye.</p>
<p>She didn’t reject him. Her astral eyes met his head on. Their gazes locked onto each other and seemed to be crossing time itself back to an untraceable past.</p>
<p>As he touched her pretty face, he slowly closed his eyes while she did the same.</p>
<p>The whole scene turned quiet. Their physical contact assisted her in feeling his aura. Time seemed to have stopped as the two were falling into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Even the wind stopped blowing and time halted its flow. Nothing in this world wanted to disturb the two.</p>
<p>It was a destined moment decided long ago. It looked as if they knew each other for a long time and had a deep affection for one another.</p>
<p>After a long time, the two of them opened their eyes at the same time. Their movements were of the same beat.</p>
<p>Li Qiye said with emotion: “Indeed… the eons are too numerous to count, so much has been lost.”</p>
<p>The woman slightly tilted her head. Her eyes showed her slight confusion and wisdom as she spoke: “Are you a philosopher?” [1. I put some thought into this one. Wise man, sage, or philosopher. I’ve used sage for different words in the past, leaning towards the holy aspect rather than wisdom. This is a new word entirely in ED; it has never been used before, at least in my memories. Philosopher is a good fit for it. Wise man seemed out of place since I believe it is a type of status or position. Who knows? Just the nature of translating ED sometimes, especially when dealing with the past.]</p>
<p>“No. I’m not a philosopher.” Li Qiye smilingly replied: “Others call me a murderous devil while some prefer the dark hand. There are all kinds of titles, but philosopher is a first.”</p>
<p>“You are a philosopher.” The confused woman still gave this verdict. Despite her slightly bewildered expression, her eyes had cleared up and now held great conviction.</p>
<p>“Fine, I’m a philosopher then.” Li Qiye gave up: “It is only a title, nothing too important.”</p>
<p>With that, he took his time sitting down and patted at the chair next to him. She also sat down with a leisurely and natural demeanor. It was just a simple action, yet she seemed to be in tune with nature.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” Ruyan asked with interest while looking at this mysterious beauty.</p>
<p>“Name?” She curiously stared at Ruyan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h4>Chapter 1296: Fairy</h4>
<p>Chapter 1296: Fairy</p>
<p>Ruyan noticed her confusion and quickly elaborated: “Yes, name, mine is Liu Ruyan. This is my senior sister, Zhuo Jianshi. What’s yours?”</p>
<p>She introduced themselves to her. The woman glanced at Ruyan then Jianshi and tilted her head in contemplation. She seemed to be trying to remember her name, but after a long time, she replied: “I don’t know...?”</p>
<p>The girls felt a bit sad while looking at the hazy woman who couldn’t recall her name. It felt like something was missing from her life.</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes darted over to Li Qiye as she questioned: “Do I have a name?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at her peerless appearance and mused for a moment before smiling: “You have no name in this world. Let’s call you Fairy then, a woman from a distant world.” [1. Note, fairy here = immortal + woman. Ren hates using the word fairy for immortal woman. He advocated femmortal instead at one time. The reason I’m pointing this out is because the word immortal is always in high emphasis, especially when Li Qiye said that she is from a distant world. Fairy alone doesn’t connect the two.]</p>
<p>Fairy repeated her name and had no objections. Although “fairy” was not a name, the girls felt that it was very appropriate. It seemed that outside of her, no one else should be called “fairy”.</p>
<p>Fairy seemed to be without joy and worries. She sat down next to Li Qiye and curiously looked at him: “What’s your name, then?”</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye smiled and gently fixed the loose hair on her forehead: “My parents said that I cried for seven days and nights after being born. However, crying is not necessarily a bad thing. It shows that there are still things in this world that can make you sad. If one can’t even feel sadness, then their world would be too bleak.”</p>
<p>He paused for a moment before continuing: “They also said that I was really cute and cried a lot as a baby. Of course, those were tears of happiness, showing that this world was still splendid and beautiful. On the other hand, if everyone sheds tears instead of just one individual, then that world would be filled with despair. Once its inhabitants lose hope, it would face destruction.”</p>
<p>With that, he softly sighed with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>This comment of his seemed to be random and confusing, but Fairy listened carefully with amusement as if she was feeling something else.</p>
<p>The other girls were intrigued as well. They thought about it and felt that his words encompassed many different meanings.</p>
<p>It sounded like he was talking about himself but also not at the same time. Crying was definitely the topic, but it wasn’t the fundamental focus.</p>
<p>There were some secrets hidden within these words that the two girls were unaware of. Fairy quietly sat there without replying. Her expression was melancholic, even a bit lonely and dazed.</p>
<p>Her astral eyes were flashing as if she was recalling something but couldn’t quite grasp it.</p>
<p>“My heart aches.” In the end, she told him this. It was a sudden remark without any reason.</p>
<p>Li Qiye held her jade-like hand and solemnly looked into her eyes: “Pain is good, it shows that you are alive.”</p>
<p>“Is it the same for you?” She stared at his eyes as if wanting to peer through the windows of his mind. Her clear gaze would illuminate his inner world.</p>
<p>Li Qiye contemplated her question before revealing a smile: “As long as the heart is alive and beating, it will feel pain. However, a long-lasting pain will eventually lead to numbness. Life and death, departures and farewells — all of this will lead to calluses.”</p>
<p>The confused woman asked: “Will it eventually be torn apart?”</p>
<p>“That depends on the person.” Li Qiye still had a smile on his face: “I won’t let my heart be torn because I am a murderous devil, the hand of darkness. In this world, wherever I am shall be filled with corpses and blood. I am numb to life and death, so regardless of how the world is, I will never taste that tearing sensation again.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Her eyes were both clear yet hazy. She stretched out her hand to touch his face as if wanting to feel his existence and heartbeat.</p>
<p>He didn’t answer her question. A long silence ensued.</p>
<p>“Your heart will feel pain.” Eventually, she sincerely looked at him with the demeanor of a serious child.</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s expression turned stiff for a moment. After a long while, he replied: “That day will not come. I won’t allow it.”</p>
<p>She curiously asked while tilting her head: “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I am Li Qiye. After making preparations for ages… my hands will find the answer to everything.” With that, he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>These words incited some memories within her, but not anything specific. It was as if there were matters or things that had been lingering in her mind. She seemed to hear crying in the distance. It was intangible and surreal.</p>
<p>Fairy asked: “Did you hear the cries?”</p>
<p>Li Qye slowly answered: “I have never heard the cries before, not that I’m able to.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” She acted like a little girl ignorant of this world.</p>
<p>He took his time answering: “A murderous devil does not care for the lamenting wails, so I do not hear them.”</p>
<p>“You are not a devil.” She frowned. Despite her current innocent state, she was quite firm in this response.</p>
<p>“I’m not a savior either.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>Fairy ruminated the answer and found it logical before nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>The rest of the group stared at them while listening to this strange conversation. These two behaved so naturally that if they hadn’t been watching from the start, they would have mistaken them for old friends.</p>
<p>Moreover, their dialogue was incredibly bizarre and inexplicable beyond comprehension, as if they were from a different world.</p>
<p>She eventually asked him like an inquisitive student: “What must be done for the heart to not ache and the ears to not hear the cries?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at her in contemplation before holding her hands and earnestly saying: “There has never been a right answer to this, but I can give you two possible choices if you must know. First, stop worrying about it, you will grow numb as time passes. One day, you will stop feeling pain and the cries shall disappear.”</p>
<p>Fairy pondered and found that this was not the answer she wanted. She looked at him again and asked: “What about the second?”</p>
<p>“Kill the villainous heavens.” Li Qiye was completely serious: “This is a solution to your question. Alas, there is a chance that what you will find is … more pain and more cries…”</p>
<p>She wholeheartedly considered this second answer for a very long time. This prompted her next question: “Would killing the villainous heavens really give an answer? One without pain and anguish?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat back down and spoke with sorrow: “I don’t know because no one has been successful before. There is no answer to that question. As I said before, killing him might only lead to even more agony.”</p>
<p>She carefully savored his answer. Her star-like eyes were flashing randomly. The same fluctuations appeared again in her memories. In the end, nothing returned.</p>
<p>She eventually inquired after a long reflection: “What should I do, then?”</p>
<p>“That’s up to you.” Li Qiye gently sighed in response after showing a brief smile: “Everyone has their own path, but not all wish to start this journey in fear of failing and not reaching the end. It might be better to stop halfway.”</p>
<p>He sentimentally concluded: “Ignorance can be bliss. Being in charge of the present is to have everything. Some have love, some have authority, and others are content with just having offspring. That is happiness to them. Ignorance is wonderful and very enviable.”</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1297: Bones Island</h4>
<p>Chapter 1297: Bones Island</p>
<p>Fairy mulled over Li Qiye’s comment. After a long time, she seemed to understand something and nodded to herself. The rest of the group still found the conversation to be puzzling and indiscernible.</p>
<p>Of course, they didn’t know that this confusing story was actually referring to the pinnacle of the world, the ultimate topic among cultivators. The things involved were beyond their understanding.</p>
<p>Li Qiye sat in his chair, seemingly deep in sleep, while Fairy kept him company. Her expression was a bit muddled, as if she was shouldering an eternal burden.</p>
<p>After a long time, Li Qiye opened his eyes and told Liu Ruyan: “Before heading to the Bonesea, we’ll take a trip to Bones Island.”</p>
<p>“I’m also tired, so I’ll be resting.” Li Qiye stood up then told Fairy: “You can just follow me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare a room for you, Young Noble.” Jianshi went to accommodate Li Qiye’s daily life.</p>
<p>Before following Jianshi, Li Qiye looked at Xiong Qianbei and flatly said: “You also want to go to the Bonesea, right? Good, find something to do, I don’t keep idle people around.”</p>
<p>“Ah, this lowly one will follow you. Just give me orders whenever you need something.” Qianbei was ecstatic and quickly bowed.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t respond as he left with Fairy.</p>
<p>Bones Island could be considered a famous destination in the Dragon Demon Sea. It was also very strange and creepy.</p>
<p>True to its name, the entire island was made from bones. There were no vegetation or creeks and streams, only bones and more bones.</p>
<p>Walking on the island was akin to walking on bones. Every single inch of the island was paved with this hard and white substance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they came in all shapes and sizes. Tibia, ribs, pelvic bones… There were also little pieces that resembled bird claws and arms as big as a bridge.</p>
<p>The island had all kinds of buildings that acted as pavilions, rooms, and palaces… They were quite frightening as well.</p>
<p>A huge skull was upside down on the ground, serving as a house. Huge elbow bones were put together while more bones were embedded on top in order to form pavilions. Other palaces were more intricate with many bones connected together…</p>
<p>At the same time, the residents here were different as well. Unsurprisingly, they were skeletons. Of course, they were not all human skeletons in the ordinary sense.</p>
<p>People would see skeletons with a crocodile’s skull and a human frame with more than ten bone spurs that resembled chicken claws on their backs. The two legs were made from thick and large rhinoceros bones.</p>
<p>These strange skeletons wearing robes and walking on the streets were not strange images at all. The majority of the inhabitants on this island were skeletons made from strange bones.</p>
<p>Compared to these weird creations, a human skeleton was a much stranger sight at Bones Island.</p>
<p>When Ruyan’s ship was anchored outside the island, the inhabitants here came to receive them. One of them stood before the docking location.</p>
<p>“Sir, may I ask why you are here at Bones Island?” This thing had an elephant’s skull, a body made out of fishbones, and the legs of a crane. Such a frame supporting its large skull was quite unbelievable.</p>
<p>Moreover, its robe was quite loose, resulting in a very amusing scene. Others wouldn’t know what to think of it. If this was another location, a talking skeleton would scare the souls out of people.</p>
<p>Li Qiye looked at it and smiled: “I want to meet your island lord.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir, I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. Bones Island does not have a lord.” The skeleton shook its head and smiled.</p>
<p>Could you imagine a smiling elephant skull? This smile was even uglier than a crying grimace — a truly horrifying scene.</p>
<p>Li Qiye leisurely replied: “Really now? I’ll eat first before seeing him. If he doesn’t come to see me, I’ll destroy this island.”</p>
<p>Such words made Ruyan and Jianshi look at each other. Not too many would dare to make this claim at Bones Island.</p>
<p>The inhabitants here were amalgamations of bones. They didn’t seem to be that powerful as they were only a bunch of bones put together.</p>
<p>However, no one dared to provoke this area. Rumor has it that a very long time ago, a True God believed that he was invincible and wanted to research the mysteries of the island. Alas, he was captured alive and hung on the island. The people here pulled out his bones one by one. They said that this god screamed for nine days and nine nights before dying. Many experts got goosebumps after seeing his corpse.</p>
<p>From then on, all the troublemakers steered clear of this island.</p>
<p>“Sir, you are too funny.” The skeleton didn’t become angry, it only cheerfully said: “If you wish to eat, then please go to the Bones Restaurant. This way.”</p>
<p>With that, it led the way for Li Qiye. Li Qiye smiled and followed it into the island while looking around.</p>
<p>Bones were everywhere in sight. Strangely enough, it was a very clean location and the air was quite fresh.</p>
<p>If it was any other location, the sheer number of bones would definitely result in corpse energy or a bad odor, but not here at Bones Island.</p>
<p>It was outrageously clean to an abnormal level. Each bone was as white as ivory, as if they had been polished countless times.</p>
<p>Li Qiye appreciated the scenery while following the skeleton. With regards to the bizarre circumstances, there were many places in the nine worlds where bones could walk and speak after returning to life.</p>
<p>However, these creatures would be accompanied by other phenomena. For example, a skeleton in a burial ground would be empowered by a soulfire found in its eye sockets. Another scenario would be that the skeleton absorbed too much evil energy and became a walking corpse.</p>
<p>However, it was completely different here. These skeletons didn’t have soulfires or evil energy. They were made up of pure bones.</p>
<p>This prompted the question, how were they created? What was the power fueling them?</p>
<p>This enigma continued to confound all of the researchers because no one dared to maneuver against the inhabitants here.</p>
<p>In fact, Li Qiye was not the only foreign guest traveling on the island. People from all over the seas came to visit.</p>
<p>In normal times, cultivators from Dragon Demon Sea would come to experience the unique magical properties of the island. But now, it was needless to say that everyone who was on their way to the Bonesea had to go through Bones Island. Because of this, they decided to rest here and check out the wonders at the same time. Thus, it was quite lively with many different races from the outside present.</p>
<p>This skeleton brought Li Qiye to a restaurant made from a huge skull. The two eye sockets acting as doors instilled a chilling sensation.</p>
<p>However, the scarier part was that the restaurant was filled with cultivators from the outside. They came from all over the world while the serving skeletons swerved around them with wine and meals. It was a party in full swing. Of course, these cultivators were here for an adventure and to satiate their curiosity, it wasn’t for the food.</p>
<p>This scene would be horrifying to unwary spectators. They would think that this was a grand feast of the underworld.</p>
<p>“Meow, meow, meow…” When Li Qiye walked into the restaurant, a skeletal cat that was squatting in front of the counter waved towards Li Qiye. It looked like it was meant to be a lucky cat if it were alive. [1. The Chinese version of maneki-neko or "lucky cat", a Japanese figurine cat usually found at the entrance of shops, restaurants, etc. They’re believed to bring good fortune.]</p>
<p>“Lil’ Bones, our guests are here, take good care of them.” The skeleton told the cat and left.</p>
<p>Even the tables in this restaurant were made from bones. Li Qiye’s table was made out of finger bones while his chair was made from leg bones. There was a chilling sensation whenever someone sat down.</p>
<p>A waiter came and cheerfully smiled at him: “Sir, what would you like?”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h4>Chapter 1298: Mu Shaolong</h4>
<p>Chapter 1298: Mu Shaolong</p>
<p>Li Qiye responded with his own smile and said: “Bring out your best dishes.”</p>
<p>“Sir, our specialities are ghostblood wine and dried bones.” The waiter answered very quickly: “Do you still want some?”</p>
<p>“One serving of each, then.” Li Qiye maintained his carefree smile.</p>
<p>“Okay, one ghostblood wine and one dried bones!” The waiter shouted and then left. He came back soon afterward with a bottle of wine.</p>
<p>The bottle was made out of a polished skull. The nose was where the wine came out. The cup was made from bone as well, and there was an eye as big as an ox’s with blood inside.</p>
<p>Li Qiye coolly poured wine into the cup. The liquid was blood-red. Some little explosions resounded when the wine entered the cup as bubbles that resembled skulls popped here and there.</p>
<p>The scariest part was the red eye in the cup. It started moving after making contact with the wine. The liquid began to slowly boil and emit a comforting aroma.</p>
<p>Wine made of blood and a cup made out of bone with a rotating eye inside. Even though the comforting aroma was very tempting, how many people would actually dare to drink it with this presentation?</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind and gently took a sip. The alcohol was strong but not dry, pure without being overly concentrated — an excellent taste.</p>
<p>After finishing one cup, he poured another for himself. The eye in the cup seemed to be very close to the drinker, but it didn’t disturb Li Qiye at all.</p>
<p>He drank and glanced around at the many varied guests in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Some came to adventure while others came with purpose. Many also only wanted to rest.</p>
<p>The majority of the cultivators were here at Bones Island for the first time, so they were quite curious and looked back and forth.</p>
<p>Among the guests, two young men were particularly conspicuous due to the groups surrounding them. The members of the groups were Virtuous Paragons from the previous generation. Interestingly enough, they seemed to be flattering the two.</p>
<p>They didn’t come from the same sect; one grew up to be quite handsome while the other was brave and bright in appearance.</p>
<p>A young cultivator asked with an obsequious grin: “Young Noble Bao, are you going to the Bonesea this time as well?”</p>
<p>“I’m here to scout as a foot soldier for my grandmaster.” The handsome youth smiled. He spoke with a fairly reserved tone, but there was an air of pride around him.</p>
<p>“Is Senior Zhentian also coming?” An old paragon was startled and in disbelief.</p>
<p>The youth spoke with pride: “Yes. Gentlemen, I’ll share something with you all. My grandmaster has come into being, he will definitely become the Immortal Emperor of this generation.”</p>
<p>“Meng Zhentian…” The crowd was shocked as if a bomb had went off. The initially bustling restaurant quieted down. Only gasps could be heard. [1. Meng Zhentian = Dream Suppressing (the) Heaven. A cool name, so you know he’s a cool character?]</p>
<p>“Is Senior Meng really coming out in this generation?” The older paragons couldn’t hide their astonishment.</p>
<p>This handsome young man was Bao Yujiang, hailing from the Dream Empyrean. This was a mighty charming spirit lineage in this region. However, the thing that people were most afraid of was its Era Evader and supreme existence, Meng Zhentian.</p>
<p>The heroic youth smiled and told the paragons: “Brother Hu, Brother Bao wouldn’t hide such a grand event from you.”</p>
<p>These two youths were decently strong, but they still had a long way to go compared to the other geniuses. However, they still dared to call paragons from the previous generation as brothers.</p>
<p>Bao Yujiang’s master was Cao Guojian, a direct disciple of Meng Zhentian. Therefore, even the contemporary geniuses had to give him some face.</p>
<p>As for the heroic youth, his talents weren’t bad, but more importantly, he came from the Celestial Pavilion. Even though the disciples from this sect rarely traveled outside, they enjoyed great respect on these rare occasions.</p>
<p>His name was Mu Shaolong, a relatively high-ranking member of the pavilion. Compared to the grand characters who didn’t like to come out, he enjoyed running outside to make friends. Because of this, even though his cultivation was inferior to his peers such as the Extreme Yang Monarch, he was still famous in Heaven Spirit.</p>
<p>“Brother Shaolong is right. My grandmaster was good friends with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong, so he didn’t wish to compete against the emperor as that would ruin their brotherhood. He evaded that era and is coming out for the Heaven’s Will this time.” Bao Yujiang nodded and held his head high when talking about his grandmaster.</p>
<p>He was not one to bully others due to his background, but he couldn’t help but exude great confidence when referring to his grandmaster, Meng Zhentian.</p>
<p>The guests here felt suffocated as cold chills ran through their bodies after hearing this.</p>
<p>Meng Zhentian’s name had a supreme effect in Heaven Spirit; anyone would be scared after hearing his name. Rumor has it that he was only one step away from becoming an Immortal Emperor.</p>
<p>Mu Shaolong broke the silence and smiled: “Congratulations, Brother Bao. When Senior Meng becomes Immortal Emperor, you will surely lead an imperial legion across the nine worlds.”</p>
<p>Mu Shaolong’s vanity was greatly stroked by this comment. He felt quite pleased and replied: “Please, Brother Shaolong, you are too kind. In the future, I will still need your assistance. Who doesn’t know that the Celestial Pavilion is a place full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers? If the Lunargrasp Fairy comes out, no one can oppose her in the nine worlds.”</p>
<p>Even though Bao Yujiang was gloating at the moment, he didn’t dare to flaunt his haughtiness in front of Mu Shaolong and returned the praise.</p>
<p>“My matriarch has been in seclusion for a long time now. Juniors like us don’t even have the chance to seek an audience.” Mu Shaolong enjoyed the comment, but he still softly sighed.</p>
<p>Bao Yujiang quickly replied while smiling: “Senior Lunargrasp is already invincible. She is enlightened and understands all the mysteries in this world. It isn’t strange for her to be seclusive at all.”</p>
<p>People were shocked by Meng Zhentian earlier, but the atmosphere became even quieter when the Lunargrasp Fairy was mentioned.</p>
<p>This name had not been brought up for a long time, but it was still more than enough to shake the entire Heaven Spirit World.</p>
<p>The Celestial Pavilion was a mysterious lineage. Being low-key failed to demonstrate their incredible strength. Despite not having an Immortal Emperor, it was even more powerful than an imperial lineage. Rumor has it that celestial immortals had appeared in the pavilion before, but no one knows if this was true or not.</p>
<p>The Lunargrasp Fairy deterred an entire era. This fear only spread when she didn’t come into being from one generation to another! Why? It was because she was the most powerful rival of Empress Hong Tian!</p>
<p>Even Li Qiye, who was sitting there leisurely without a care for the two’s conversation, batted his eyes after hearing the name “Lunargrasp.”</p>
<p>He looked over at Mu Shaolong and calmed himself before asking: “Is the Lunargrasp Fairy still living alone at Fullmoon Peak?”</p>
<p>Li Qiye suddenly stood out in this quiet restaurant. There weren’t that many humans in Heaven Spirit to begin with. If the crowd wasn’t distracted by the conversation, they would have noticed a human like Li Qiye much earlier.</p>
<p>“Yes, how did you know?” Mu Shaolong was startled and looked over at Li Qiye.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer. He was lamenting in his mind as the past resurfaced along with many emotions.</p>
<p>Mu Shaolong smiled and asked: “May I ask for your name, Brother?”</p>
<p>“Li Qiye.” He looked at Mu Shaolong and nodded with a smile. His personality normally wouldn’t care for other cultivators outside of those who were too ignorant to know any better, so his current attitude towards Mu Shaolong was considered very friendly.</p>
<p>After the words “Li Qiye” sounded, some of the cultivators were aghast. A few even moved away from him to keep a safe distance.</p>
<p>Even though they hadn’t seen Li Qiye before, his notoriety had spread far and wide. Many in Heaven Spirit were well-aware of his fierceness.</p>
<p>Sacrificing a billion teeming fish, massacring Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village, and most importantly, killing Shangguan Feiyan — these were all deeds that astounded the masses.</p>
<p>“So it is Brother Li, I have heard of your name long ago.” Mu Shaolong cupped his fists politely. Of course, he didn’t need to flatter a human like Li Qiye. The Celestial Pavilion had no need to fawn over anyone.</p>
<p>Bao Yujiang was immediately interested and asked with a smile: “Brother Li, you are now famous all over the world, why not sit down and have a few drinks with us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, come and sit with us. If Brother Bao could take Brother Li to see Senior Zhentian, I’m sure the senior would appreciate him.” Mu Shaolong could see that Yujiang was interested, so he echoed the sentiment.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1299: Old Zhu</h4>
<p>Chapter 1299: Old Zhu</p>
<p>In recent days, Li Qiye was preeminent among the humans. Many even thought that he had the highest chance of becoming an Immortal Emperor for his race. The humans here had high hopes for him.</p>
<p>Bao Yujiang wanted to earn Li Qiye’s favor. Although he said he wanted to introduce Li Qiye to his grandmaster, this was only to attract him so that he might join his own ranks.</p>
<p>In his eyes, his grandmaster would certainly become an Immortal Emperor. As his granddisciple, he was qualified to lead a legion. If he could have someone as strong as Li Qiye as his underling, it would increase his power and status later on.</p>
<p>Li Qiye only maintained his smile and continued to drink his ghostblood wine.</p>
<p>Yujiang felt disrespected at Li Qiye’s lack of response. Even though he wasn’t considered a genius, his backing was quite immense and allowed him to do whatever he pleased regardless of the location. But now, this public lack of sensibility from Li Qiye left him in a tough spot, worsening his mood.</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t retaliate, he scowled with an angry expression.</p>
<p>“Well, this can be considered a missed opportunity. How unfortunate, it will be prohibitively difficult to get the same chance in the future.” Mu Shaolong shook his head when he saw Li Qiye’s lack of consideration. Of course, he wouldn’t interfere with Bao Yujiang’s matter.</p>
<p>“Brother Bao, you should come to the Jade Sea some time, I’ll be your guide.” After noticing that Yujiang was recruiting, a smart youth immediately tried to please him.</p>
<p>“Virtuous Nephew, the doors to our Sacredheart Gate will always be open to you.” Even an old paragon withdrew his strong display in order to earn some points.</p>
<p>The young ones wanted to become his friends or at least underlings if possible. As for the older generation, it was too much for paragons like them to work under Yujiang. Nevertheless, they were still willing to lower their own status in order to befriend him.</p>
<p>Meng Zhentian was coming into being in this generation. In the eyes of the inhabitants of Heaven Spirit, it was certain that he would become an Immortal Emperor.</p>
<p>True to his name, he was powerful enough. Some even said that one would be hard-pressed to find a worthy foe for him in the entire nine worlds.</p>
<p>For many, it was easier to befriend an emperor before they ascended the throne than try to establish a relationship afterward.</p>
<p>Just having the tiniest relationship with an emperor or becoming one of their soldiers was not only a fast way towards success, even their sects would ride their coattails towards glory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye was only interested in the Lunargrasp Fairy. As for this Meng Zhentian and Bao Yujiang, he didn’t place them in his sight at all, so he no longer paid attention to them. Instead, he looked at the time and then outside.</p>
<p>At this time, his food was served. Li Qiye didn’t look at it for long before he asked the waiter: “Your old man isn’t here today to sell stuff?”</p>
<p>“Sir, are you talking about Old Chu?” The waiter smiled: “The number of visitors has recently skyrocketed. He is usually very punctual, maybe something is holding him up.”</p>
<p>Right after the waiter finished speaking, a clank came from outside the door as a person came in.</p>
<p>The waiter cheerfully told Li Qiye: “Speaking of the devil, Old Chu is here.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye shifted his gaze towards the door. A person with a complete human skeleton was walking in. He wore a wide robe while carrying a big wooden trunk. He himself was just a tiny skeleton. Appearance wise, he wasn’t that special.</p>
<p>However, it was rare to see a complete skeleton on Bones Island; it was much rarer than seeing living beings.</p>
<p>Li Qiye’s smile widened after seeing this little skeleton.</p>
<p>“Clang, clang, clang!” Old Chu came inside and rang his bell. A hoarse voice came from his chest: “Immemorial secret bones, heaven-seer divine gaze, the hand of an immortal… Everything is on sale!”</p>
<p>The first-timers were very curious when they saw this little merchant. As for those who had been here before, they were very cautious of Old Chu, but they were curious nonetheless.</p>
<p>“Immemorial secret bones, heaven-seer divine gaze, the hand of an immortal?” A regular visitor couldn’t help but ask: “Old Chu, are you selling counterfeits?”</p>
<p>“Counterfeits?” Old Chu stared at this cultivator. Despite not having eyes, his attitude was clear. He retorted: “My reputation has been gold-clad for nine reincarnations, I would never sell counterfeits.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, stop with your trickery. Last time, I bought a piece of bone from a Thundervoid Kui, but it was completely useless and almost killed me.” The cultivator snorted.</p>
<p>Old Chu explained with a smile: “Oh, that Thundervoid Kui bone? You didn’t buy its blood, this type of bone requires the blood of the beast as well before it is able to divert a thunder tribulation.”</p>
<p>The smile of a skeleton like this was a macabre sight.</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you tell me this when I bought the bone?” The cultivator was quite dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Old Chu asked: “My bad, I didn’t have the goods last time, but I thought you knew. Now that I think about it, I just so happen to have some Thundervoid Kui blood, do you want a bottle?”</p>
<p>The old cultivator wanted to vomit blood. He had been swindled by Old Chu once, but he couldn’t do anything about it. No one would recklessly attack the skeletons on this island.</p>
<p>“What are the immemorial secret bones?” Mu Shaolong’s curiosity was piqued.</p>
<p>Old Chu looked over at Shaolong and somewhat mysteriously spoke: “Can’t say, can’t say. When you buy it, you will learn its magical effects right away.”</p>
<p>“How much?” Shaolong was from the Celestial Pavilion, so money was not a problem for him.</p>
<p>“My business has but a single rule: I only accept longevity blood, nothing else.” Old Chu shook his head in response.</p>
<p>Some first-timers exchanged glances. Longevity blood was too precious for cultivators, especially the older ones.</p>
<p>“How much? One bottle?” Shaolong was very interested in the bones.</p>
<p>“From you?” Old Chu shook his head again: “Your blood won’t do. I need at least one bottle of longevity blood from a supreme Godking for this deal.” [1. Don’t know if Supreme is a rank for Godking or just a regular adjective. Leaving it as an adjective for now until the author indicates otherwise.]</p>
<p>“Longevity blood of a Godking?!” Shaolong was startled after hearing this. Despite having deep pockets, he couldn’t come up with this type of item.</p>
<p>When one reached the level of Godking, they wouldn’t easily extract their own longevity blood.</p>
<p>“What about the hand of an immortal?” Yujiang felt like asking.</p>
<p>Old Chu happily answered: “Not expensive at all, just ten drops of Immortal Emperor Longevity Blood.”</p>
<p>The crowd’s expression changed. Ten drops of imperial blood was priceless. Just one drop alone could make a man beyond wealthy. Not even an imperial lineage could necessarily produce ten drops.</p>
<p>Someone who had been here before asked: “Old Chu, why are your goods so expensive this time around?”</p>
<p>Old Chu replied: “The situation has changed. The artifact of immortality has come out and the Bonesea is surging. Recently, I obtained a number of treasures, but in reality, it is everyone’s fortune.”</p>
<p>Despite this, this sky-high price was not something that they could afford.</p>
<p>“Give me a box of protection talismans.” While the others were asking if Old Chu had other items, Li Qiye knew exactly what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Coming. Sir, what kind of protection talisman do you want?” Old Chu started to beam after finding a customer. His skeletal expression was incredibly lifelike.</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t say anything; instead, he put a small bottle on the table. Old Chu took it and shook it next to his ear. His expression turned serious right away. He opened his wooden box and carefully looked inside before taking out an antique box with an old smell. He placed it before Li Qiye and said in a serious manner: “Sir, these are the talismans that you wanted.”</p>
<p>Li Qiye didn’t bother checking the contents and casually stored this box away in his robes.</p>
<p>“Old Chu, you still have more talismans?” One of his old customers asked with surprise: “I thought you ran out a while ago?”</p>
<p>Old Chu bragged: “Hehehe, because of the phenomenon going on at the Bonesea right now, I risked my old life to and found a batch of the best talismans. Do you want some?”</p>
<p>A junior asked in response: “What are these protection talismans?”</p>
<p>“It’s a talisman for the Bonesea that protects the body from potential attacks.” The cultivator stared at Old Chu, wondering if he should buy some or not.</p>
<p>“Can his talismans actually protect people in the Bonesea?” Many eyes lit up after hearing this. After all, everyone wanted to go to the Bonesea.</p>
<p>A cultivator palpitating from excitement asked: “Give me a box, what’s the price?”</p>
<p>Old Chu responded: “One bottle of longevity blood.”</p>
<p>The cultivator hesitated for a moment before taking out his own longevity blood and handing it to Old Chu.</p>
<p>The old man took out a wooden box from the trunk and handed it to him. The cultivator looked at it and asked: “How come mine is different?”</p>
<p>His box was drastically different from Li Qiye’s.</p>
