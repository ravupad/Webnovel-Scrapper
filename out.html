 <p><b>Chapter 1197: Dao Attendant Lin</b></p>
 <p>This dao attendant was situated in a corner near a window. There were some other cultivators sitting with him that seemed to be moon gazing. When the dao attendant called Li Qiye out, these cultivators looked at him with unfriendly gazes as well.</p>
 <p>The guests in the inn held their breaths after seeing this. Some even moved further back lest they get involved in this mess.</p>
 <p>Many of the guests recognized this attendant. It was Dao Attendant Lin, the servant of Daoist Lin from the Immaculate Expanse.</p>
 <p>Not to mention this attendant’s powerful backing, this young man ahead surely wasn’t a nice person either since he dared to eat dragon tendons publicly. At the very least, he must be very fierce.</p>
 <p>Moreover, this involved the Teeming Sea Tribe, and no one with a sense of self-preservation wanted to deal with them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chewed another dragon tendon then gulped it down before slowly turning towards the attendant: “Immaculate Expanse, right? Your progenitor also ate dragon tendons. He swallowed millions of tendons in one gulp, it is no big deal.”</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin wanted to question Li Qiye because the Immaculate Expanse had some friendship with the Teeming Sea Tribe. After all, this tribe numbered in the billions, so it made sense that it had some relationships with the sects in this world.</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t expect such a response from Li Qiye. In the Heaven Spirit World, the majority of the top level experts had all eaten dragon tendons before. After all, they were a type of delicacy.</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t know if his progenitor had eaten them or not, he didn’t dare to deny this claim.</p>
 <p>“Well, well, it is not the same in this case.” He struggled to blurt out a reply.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took out another tendon and chewed on it carefully before lazily speaking: “Oh? Not the same? How is it not similar? Do tell. Is it because your progenitor used fire to broil them instead? Then I would really be disappointed, that is like steaming a good pear. The best and most delicious way to eat dragon tendon is with turmeric and aged seasoning…”</p>
 <p>“... Back then when Immortal Emperor Wu Gou was young, he used this very type of seasoning and ate tens of millions of dragon tendons. The Teeming Fish were so scared that they ran to the bottom of the sea and didn’t dare to come out for a period of time. This became a well-known legend. As for your Immaculate Expanse Progenitor, who knows what he did back then?” Li Qiye ate one more tendon at this point.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be quite pleased with this feast. In fact, many spectators were quietly swallowing their own saliva, but they didn’t dare to join in.</p>
 <p>This delicious meal was no secret in the Heaven Spirit World. Everyone knew that the Teeming Fish were the most vicious and numerous. However, few people dared to say that their tendons were also extremely delicious!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye truly made many people hungry, but no one wanted to incite the anger of the Teeming Tribe. His words also silenced Dao Attendant Lin and shocked the inn’s boss as well. He suddenly involved the Void Imperfection School. After all, this was no longer Immortal Emperor Wu Gou’s generation, his school also didn’t want to provoke this fish tribe even if they were stronger. The real problem was that there were too many of them.</p>
 <p>“You…” Dao Attendant Lin couldn’t retort. He struggled to say: “You are eating dragon tendons before all of us, this is a very cruel and evil display. The Teeming Tribe is part of the sea demons, a great race in the Heaven Spirit World. You are eating living cultivators, an extremely vicious path far from the dao!”</p>
 <p>“Extremely vicious and straying away from the dao?” Li Qiye laughed in response: “If you are saying that I am vicious, then I will accept it. However, if this is because of me eating dragon tendons, then my teeth are about to fall out from laughter…”</p>
 <p>“... Teeming Tribe? They’re nothing special, merely living creatures no different from beasts. Not to mention that I am a human, even the sea demons in this world do not consider them to be cultivators.”</p>
 <p>He carefully chewed on more tendons before leisurely continuing: “Don’t think so highly of yourself. In their eyes, you cultivators are no different from food. They have eaten countless cultivators and mortals, so me eating them today is part of the natural order.”</p>
 <p>At this point, he coldly glared at the boy: “When you eat meat, do you consider yourself to be cruel as well?”</p>
 <p>“You…” The attendant was speechless once again. Because of some ties with the Teeming Prince, he wanted to speak up for the Teeming Tribe, but he didn’t expect to be left tongue-tied by Li Qiye’s swift rhetoric!</p>
 <p>The guests didn't dare to openly praise Li Qiye’s response despite agreeing in their minds. The Teeming Tribe being cruel was not anything new. Their enemies would eventually be eaten until there was nothing left. Countless cultivation sects had been destroyed and innumerable mortals had been devoured. Alas, the angry cultivators and lineages were apprehensive of them and didn’t dare to speak up.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, today, said many things that resonated with the crowd, so they cheered him on in their minds.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped paying attention to Dao Attendant Lin and got bored after eating for a while. He immediately burned all of the fish and stood up to leave.</p>
 <p>The dao attendant snorted while watching his departing back. The youth didn’t expect to be humiliated like this. He had a hard time swallowing this anger. His master was Daoist Lin, the leader of the Immaculate Expanse. As his master’s confidant, he was respected everywhere he went while basking in the spotlight. But today, this human junior didn’t spare him any face at all in front of the crowd — he absolutely wouldn’t let go of this grievance!</p>
 <p>After refining the necessary items, he left Shallow Beach and headed for the coral forest.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were already here, waiting. They came from all corners of the oceans for the needlefish.</p>
 <p>Some were riding huge ships on the ocean while others were controlling swift shuttles. There were also those who rode sea turtles or gigantic whales. It was a colorful and diverse scene.</p>
 <p>These people had occupied some places at the coral forest, such as the hills. Many began to place traps around the coral trees just to wait for the needlefish…</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the forest was vast, so for the time being there was no fighting for spots.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye found Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen. The two of them had caught many insects for Li Qiye and already ground them to dust in accordance to his instructions.</p>
 <p>He found an open place and casually took a lap around to pick a spot before ordering the two boys: “Sprinkle this dust over the forest, do it all over the trees and ground.”</p>
 <p>The two immediately followed his command. Meanwhile, Li Qiye placed his refined materials onto the ground. He wanted to refine something else here. It was an item that resembled a fish hook with a very long string. This overly long string actually covered the fish hook completely.</p>
 <p>When Li Qiye was ready and the two had sprayed the insect powder everywhere, Ye Tu asked with curiosity: “Young Noble, what are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>To which Li Qiye responded while calmly sitting on the highest position in this location: “Fishing!”</p>
 <p>He asked: “Fishing? Fishing for the needlefish?” However, he immediately felt that this wasn’t right. Li Qiye had said that he didn’t care for the needlefish.</p>
 <p>He changed his question: “Is there something else besides the needlefish?”</p>
 <p>He was the supervisor of Shallow Beach and was very familiar with this area. Outside of the blossoming coral tees leading out the precious needlefish, the other marine creatures here were not worth fighting over.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied with a smile: “Yes, there is a devil shark, but you haven’t seen it before.”</p>
 <p>“Devil shark?” Ye Tu carefully thought about it, but he had never heard of such a fish in this neighborhood.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen was a bit more knowledgeable than Ye Tu. He recalled a legend after hearing Li Qiye and spoke with surprise: “The Archdevil Armored Shark?”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, that’s it.” Li Qiye said: “I want to catch it, otherwise I wouldn’t have gone to these lengths to prepare.”</p>
 <p>“Archdevil Armored Shark?” Ye Tu asked Teng Jiwen: “What kind of fish is it?”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen shook his head: “I am not clear on the specifics. I only heard that it is an extremely vicious creature. It’s also quite powerful as well. Legend states that it appeared in the Bottomless Trench, but no one has spotted it before.”</p>
 <p>With that, he became a bit worried and asked: “People say that it is extremely strong, can we actually handle it?”</p>
 <p>“Not us.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Just me. Stand to the side and watch to avoid accidents, or I won’t be able to explain it to your sects.”</p>

 <p>“... Teeming Tribe? They’re nothing special, merely living creatures no different from beasts. Not to mention that I am a human, even the sea demons in this world do not consider them to be cultivators.”</p>
 <p>He carefully chewed on more tendons before leisurely continuing: “Don’t think so highly of yourself. In their eyes, you cultivators are no different from food. They have eaten countless cultivators and mortals, so me eating them today is part of the natural order.”</p>
 <p>At this point, he coldly glared at the boy: “When you eat meat, do you consider yourself to be cruel as well?”</p>
 <p>“You…” The attendant was speechless once again. Because of some ties with the Teeming Prince, he wanted to speak up for the Teeming Tribe, but he didn’t expect to be left tongue-tied by Li Qiye’s swift rhetoric!</p>
 <p>The guests didn't dare to openly praise Li Qiye’s response despite agreeing in their minds. The Teeming Tribe being cruel was not anything new. Their enemies would eventually be eaten until there was nothing left. Countless cultivation sects had been destroyed and innumerable mortals had been devoured. Alas, the angry cultivators and lineages were apprehensive of them and didn’t dare to speak up.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, today, said many things that resonated with the crowd, so they cheered him on in their minds.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped paying attention to Dao Attendant Lin and got bored after eating for a while. He immediately burned all of the fish and stood up to leave.</p>
 <p>The dao attendant snorted while watching his departing back. The youth didn’t expect to be humiliated like this. He had a hard time swallowing this anger. His master was Daoist Lin, the leader of the Immaculate Expanse. As his master’s confidant, he was respected everywhere he went while basking in the spotlight. But today, this human junior didn’t spare him any face at all in front of the crowd — he absolutely wouldn’t let go of this grievance!</p>
 <p>After refining the necessary items, he left Shallow Beach and headed for the coral forest.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were already here, waiting. They came from all corners of the oceans for the needlefish.</p>
 <p>Some were riding huge ships on the ocean while others were controlling swift shuttles. There were also those who rode sea turtles or gigantic whales. It was a colorful and diverse scene.</p>
 <p>These people had occupied some places at the coral forest, such as the hills. Many began to place traps around the coral trees just to wait for the needlefish…</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the forest was vast, so for the time being there was no fighting for spots.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye found Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen. The two of them had caught many insects for Li Qiye and already ground them to dust in accordance to his instructions.</p>
 <p>He found an open place and casually took a lap around to pick a spot before ordering the two boys: “Sprinkle this dust over the forest, do it all over the trees and ground.”</p>
 <p>The two immediately followed his command. Meanwhile, Li Qiye placed his refined materials onto the ground. He wanted to refine something else here. It was an item that resembled a fish hook with a very long string. This overly long string actually covered the fish hook completely.</p>
 <p>When Li Qiye was ready and the two had sprayed the insect powder everywhere, Ye Tu asked with curiosity: “Young Noble, what are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>To which Li Qiye responded while calmly sitting on the highest position in this location: “Fishing!”</p>
 <p>He asked: “Fishing? Fishing for the needlefish?” However, he immediately felt that this wasn’t right. Li Qiye had said that he didn’t care for the needlefish.</p>
 <p>He changed his question: “Is there something else besides the needlefish?”</p>
 <p>He was the supervisor of Shallow Beach and was very familiar with this area. Outside of the blossoming coral tees leading out the precious needlefish, the other marine creatures here were not worth fighting over.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied with a smile: “Yes, there is a devil shark, but you haven’t seen it before.”</p>
 <p>“Devil shark?” Ye Tu carefully thought about it, but he had never heard of such a fish in this neighborhood.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen was a bit more knowledgeable than Ye Tu. He recalled a legend after hearing Li Qiye and spoke with surprise: “The Archdevil Armored Shark?”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, that’s it.” Li Qiye said: “I want to catch it, otherwise I wouldn’t have gone to these lengths to prepare.”</p>
 <p>“Archdevil Armored Shark?” Ye Tu asked Teng Jiwen: “What kind of fish is it?”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen shook his head: “I am not clear on the specifics. I only heard that it is an extremely vicious creature. It’s also quite powerful as well. Legend states that it appeared in the Bottomless Trench, but no one has spotted it before.”</p>
 <p>With that, he became a bit worried and asked: “People say that it is extremely strong, can we actually handle it?”</p>
 <p>“Not us.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Just me. Stand to the side and watch to avoid accidents, or I won’t be able to explain it to your sects.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1197: Dao Attendant Lin</b></p>
 <p>This dao attendant was situated in a corner near a window. There were some other cultivators sitting with him that seemed to be moon gazing. When the dao attendant called Li Qiye out, these cultivators looked at him with unfriendly gazes as well.</p>
 <p>The guests in the inn held their breaths after seeing this. Some even moved further back lest they get involved in this mess.</p>
 <p>Many of the guests recognized this attendant. It was Dao Attendant Lin, the servant of Daoist Lin from the Immaculate Expanse.</p>
 <p>Not to mention this attendant’s powerful backing, this young man ahead surely wasn’t a nice person either since he dared to eat dragon tendons publicly. At the very least, he must be very fierce.</p>
 <p>Moreover, this involved the Teeming Sea Tribe, and no one with a sense of self-preservation wanted to deal with them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chewed another dragon tendon then gulped it down before slowly turning towards the attendant: “Immaculate Expanse, right? Your progenitor also ate dragon tendons. He swallowed millions of tendons in one gulp, it is no big deal.”</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin wanted to question Li Qiye because the Immaculate Expanse had some friendship with the Teeming Sea Tribe. After all, this tribe numbered in the billions, so it made sense that it had some relationships with the sects in this world.</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t expect such a response from Li Qiye. In the Heaven Spirit World, the majority of the top level experts had all eaten dragon tendons before. After all, they were a type of delicacy.</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t know if his progenitor had eaten them or not, he didn’t dare to deny this claim.</p>
 <p>“Well, well, it is not the same in this case.” He struggled to blurt out a reply.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took out another tendon and chewed on it carefully before lazily speaking: “Oh? Not the same? How is it not similar? Do tell. Is it because your progenitor used fire to broil them instead? Then I would really be disappointed, that is like steaming a good pear. The best and most delicious way to eat dragon tendon is with turmeric and aged seasoning…”</p>
 <p>“... Back then when Immortal Emperor Wu Gou was young, he used this very type of seasoning and ate tens of millions of dragon tendons. The Teeming Fish were so scared that they ran to the bottom of the sea and didn’t dare to come out for a period of time. This became a well-known legend. As for your Immaculate Expanse Progenitor, who knows what he did back then?” Li Qiye ate one more tendon at this point.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be quite pleased with this feast. In fact, many spectators were quietly swallowing their own saliva, but they didn’t dare to join in.</p>
 <p>This delicious meal was no secret in the Heaven Spirit World. Everyone knew that the Teeming Fish were the most vicious and numerous. However, few people dared to say that their tendons were also extremely delicious!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye truly made many people hungry, but no one wanted to incite the anger of the Teeming Tribe. His words also silenced Dao Attendant Lin and shocked the inn’s boss as well. He suddenly involved the Void Imperfection School. After all, this was no longer Immortal Emperor Wu Gou’s generation, his school also didn’t want to provoke this fish tribe even if they were stronger. The real problem was that there were too many of them.</p>
 <p>“You…” Dao Attendant Lin couldn’t retort. He struggled to say: “You are eating dragon tendons before all of us, this is a very cruel and evil display. The Teeming Tribe is part of the sea demons, a great race in the Heaven Spirit World. You are eating living cultivators, an extremely vicious path far from the dao!”</p>
 <p>“Extremely vicious and straying away from the dao?” Li Qiye laughed in response: “If you are saying that I am vicious, then I will accept it. However, if this is because of me eating dragon tendons, then my teeth are about to fall out from laughter…”</p>
 <p>“... Teeming Tribe? They’re nothing special, merely living creatures no different from beasts. Not to mention that I am a human, even the sea demons in this world do not consider them to be cultivators.”</p>
 <p>He carefully chewed on more tendons before leisurely continuing: “Don’t think so highly of yourself. In their eyes, you cultivators are no different from food. They have eaten countless cultivators and mortals, so me eating them today is part of the natural order.”</p>
 <p>At this point, he coldly glared at the boy: “When you eat meat, do you consider yourself to be cruel as well?”</p>
 <p>“You…” The attendant was speechless once again. Because of some ties with the Teeming Prince, he wanted to speak up for the Teeming Tribe, but he didn’t expect to be left tongue-tied by Li Qiye’s swift rhetoric!</p>
 <p>The guests didn't dare to openly praise Li Qiye’s response despite agreeing in their minds. The Teeming Tribe being cruel was not anything new. Their enemies would eventually be eaten until there was nothing left. Countless cultivation sects had been destroyed and innumerable mortals had been devoured. Alas, the angry cultivators and lineages were apprehensive of them and didn’t dare to speak up.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, today, said many things that resonated with the crowd, so they cheered him on in their minds.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped paying attention to Dao Attendant Lin and got bored after eating for a while. He immediately burned all of the fish and stood up to leave.</p>

But today, this human junior didn’t spare him any face at all in front of the crowd — he absolutely wouldn’t let go of this grievance!</p>
 <p>After refining the necessary items, he left Shallow Beach and headed for the coral forest.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were already here, waiting. They came from all corners of the oceans for the needlefish.</p>
 <p>Some were riding huge ships on the ocean while others were controlling swift shuttles. There were also those who rode sea turtles or gigantic whales. It was a colorful and diverse scene.</p>
 <p>These people had occupied some places at the coral forest, such as the hills. Many began to place traps around the coral trees just to wait for the needlefish…</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the forest was vast, so for the time being there was no fighting for spots.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye found Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen. The two of them had caught many insects for Li Qiye and already ground them to dust in accordance to his instructions.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1198: Lively Coral Forest</b></p>
 <p>Both Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen didn’t oppose or support his decision.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked around the area a bit to make sure everything was ready before telling the two: “Okay, the two of you should change as well. Transform and conceal your identities, it’s up to you.”</p>
 <p>“Transform?” Teng Jiwen was surprised. After all, he was the descendant of the Heavenvine Citadel. His conduct was open and straightforward, there was no need to hide or do anything in secret.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and said: “There will be disputes when benefits are up for grabs. Conflicts are inevitable, so when one of you happens to be from the Void Imperfection School and the other from the Heavenvine Citadel, it will have a negative influence if you two follow me around killing.”</p>
 <p>Ye Tu quickly said: “Young Noble, rest assured, the schoolmaster told me to guide you and be a good host. If anything happens in our territory, we will maneuver all three schools.”</p>
 <p>This was not an exaggeration or a careless statement. There were very few things that the three schools couldn’t handle due to their sheer strength.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen supported him as well: “Ye Tu is right, your enemy is our citadel’s enemy. We will always tread together with you.”</p>
 <p>The Sunflower Forefather had instructed him earlier. This type of little trouble didn’t matter to their citadel, so they naturally wanted to take on some risk for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“The two of you are mistaken.” Li Qiye shook his head and smiled: “That isn’t what I meant. Not wanting to cause trouble for the two of you is only a small part of the reason. The truth is that I don’t want you to block my way.”</p>
 <p>“Block your way?” The two of them were a bit confused after hearing this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye explained: “With you two and your sects, who would dare to come and provoke me? How can I find a reason to kill then?”</p>
 <p>Such words astounded the two; it was as if the guy was overzealous in his quest to become a mass murderer.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to overthink things.” Li Qiye chuckled: “I love trouble, especially those who come to chase me. The more the better so I can have a baptism of blood. This is the only thing that makes me feel alive and gets my blood boiling.”</p>
 <p>With that, a glimmer of amusement flashed deep in his eyes. He could imagine this day play out already.</p>
 <p>The two of them glanced at each other. For some reason, Li Qiye’s smile creeped them out; it was like a beast showing a kind smile to a little rabbit. Anyone would be scared after seeing this smile.</p>
 <p>This had a greater effect on Teng Jiwen. He remembered when Li Qiye didn’t care for anything back at the Heavenvine Citadel. He held the ancestors in disdain and ignored absolutely everything. Just imagining the possible massacre back at the citadel left him shuddering. He could smell a sanguine stench right now. There was a faint scene of carnage with mountains of flesh and rivers of blood.</p>
 <p>The two of them quickly hid their true identities and turned into ordinary attendants before standing next to Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat down in a meditative pose inside the coral forest and slowly closed his eyes as if he was hibernating.</p>
 <p>He was not the only one to occupy an area here at the coral forest. Many people had occupied their own locations and drawn circles around their chosen zones to warn others.</p>
 <p>In a few short days, the vast coral forest became quite crowded. The latecomers didn’t have any spots, so conflicts became inevitable. In this enclosed situation, those who came from powerful sects or were personally strong were at a great advantage. No one dared to compete with them for the hills. Even if they came later, they could easily seize others’ territories.</p>
 <p>Thus, the place became particularly lively in a short amount of time. All kinds of cultivators from all the races appeared in the forest to wait for the flowers to blossom.</p>
 <p>Battles and robberies were common everyday occurrences. Many cultivators had yet to see the blossoming coral flowers before they fell in these struggles.</p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong came as well during this waiting period. He came by himself; the places he stepped on were illuminated by sunlight.</p>
 <p>After walking around the coral forest, he chose a hill near the Bottomless Trench. The problem was that some other cultivators had already claimed it.</p>
 <p>He stood above them while sweeping over them with his eyes and told these cultivators: “This place is mine. Will you leave by your own volition or will I have to resort to force?”</p>
 <p>The people who occupied this land didn’t want to fight against Yan Yanglong, so they packed their items and handed this hill over to him.</p>
 <p>No one would laugh at them for conceding in this fashion. Yan Yanglong was a disciple of the Extreme Yang Monarch. This meant that he had enough strength to look down on them. Which minor sect or vagrant cultivator was willing to mess with the monarch’s disciple?</p>
 <p>Not long after this event, Gongsun Qianer arrived as well. Her entourage was much bigger than Yan Yanglong’s. Her followers were all powerful. Their group, under her lead, was quite bullish; everyone had to make way for them.</p>
 <p>No one dared to say a word about her aggressive attitude. Even though she was only a maid, they didn’t look down on her status and strength.</p>
 <p>Her master was a concubine of the Profound God-Monarch — this was a young character known by all in the Heaven Spirit World. He came from Gu Chun’s four branches and had already become a God-Monarch. It could be said that he was invincible among the younger generation.</p>
 <p>In terms of status and power, Yan Yanglong was not necessarily higher than Gongsun Qianer at all.</p>
 <p>She took fancy to a bay close to the trench due to its excellent location. It had changed masters several times, so the current cultivator occupying it wasn’t friendly at all. He also came from a big sect and had just killed the last person who occupied this location.</p>
 <p>She glanced over and told this cultivator: “Scram, this place is mine.”</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t leave. He came from a big sect that was also quite famous at the Jade Sea. If he was to scram after she told him so, how could he have any face left?</p>
 <p>He replied with a cold expression: “You are too overbearing, I have already occupied this place.”</p>
 <p>She declared in a domineering manner: “I’ll make you scram then.” She had a high status back at the Profound Sea Dynasty, one of the four branches, so she didn’t care for a young cultivator of the same generation as her.</p>
 <p>This cultivator stood up and sneered: “Fine, let me see the great techniques of the Profound Sea Dynasty, I hope you have at least learned a little from them.”</p>
 <p>The followers next to her scowled and wanted to teach this guy a lesson, however she stopped them and revealed a cold smile: “Such impudent words, worthy of death!”</p>
 <p>The phoenix hairpin in her hair flew out before she finished speaking.</p>
 <p>It was violet in color and turned into a purple ray that moved at an indiscernible speed. It would pierce through people’s forehead before they could react.</p>
 <p>This cultivator was also strong and had great reaction speed. With a changed expression, he formed a mudra to stop the hairpin.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” Blood slowly spilled. The cultivator’s eyes were wide open as he fell down. It was useless even if he was faster; his mudra couldn’t stop this hairpin. Not only did it penetrate his mudra, it also went straight through his forehead. It was a fatal blow.</p>
 <p>She recalled her hairpin and coldly spat out: “Just an ant.” This hairpin was a treasure bestowed by the Profound Sea God-Monarch. It was quite powerful, so ordinary cultivators couldn’t stop its lethal might.</p>
 <p>The crowd was astonished by this and didn’t dare to say a word or come closer. Back at Shallow Beach, she would have scruples about killing people due to it being under the jurisdiction of the Void Imperfection School. However, in this coral forest, she could kill whoever she wanted.</p>
 <p>Many people were unwilling to near her in order to avoid getting killed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s hill was quite far from the Bottomless Trench. Very few people would care about his location, so it was a quiet stay for him. Of course, he wasn’t here for the needlefish, so he didn’t need to pick a place too close to the Bottomless Trench.</p>
 <p>He was sitting here with his eyes closed as if he was sleeping.</p>
 <p>Not long after Yan Yanglong and Gongsun Qianer got here, Dao Attendant Lin came as well. He also took a lap around the forest before stopping at Li Qiye’s hill.</p>
 <p>“A bit courageous. In a world dominated by the three great races, a human actually dares to occupy a mountain by himself.” He stopped and coldly stared at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Back at the inn, he had been completely humiliated by Li Qiye. If they weren’t at Shallow Beach, he would have taught the fool a lesson already.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1199: Needlefish</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye turned a deaf ear to the attendant’s taunt. He remained there in his meditative pose and simply ignored the attendant.</p>
 <p>Such an arrogant display enraged the attendant once again. He snorted and said: “Ignorant junior, and arrogant as well. I’m afraid you will die without a burial not long from now!”</p>
 <p>Some cultivators noticed this from the distance. Humans were quite rare in the Heaven Spirit World, but this youth was arrogant enough. Not long ago, he opposed the Teeming Sea Tribe and now, he was looking down on Dao Attendant Lin. From this, he offended two big lineages in the Jade Sea right away. Just what was this human boy’s background?</p>
 <p>Li Qiye finally opened his eyes and revealed a smile: “Come if you dare, your uncle will crush you with one hand. If you are afraid, then get the hell out of here, don’t disturb my peace!”</p>
 <p>The attendant’s expression quickly shifted as a murderous glint flashed across his pupils. However, he restrained himself from taking action.</p>
 <p>The crowd became even more confused about this human junior who was spouting such overbearing words.</p>
 <p>Everyone thought that the attendant would attack right away to kill Li Qiye. However, the attendant took a deep breath and suppressed his anger.</p>
 <p>He gave a cruel smile and sneered: “Ignorant brat, it is not difficult for me to take your dog life. However, the Teeming Marquis has declared that he wants to personally take your life and let you experience a fate worse than death. Just wait, at that time, you will regret having been born into this world. Maybe you will even beg me to end your life then.”</p>
 <p>Many people became afraid after hearing this. Someone murmured: “Teeming Marquis, will there not be a single blade of grass left?”</p>
 <p>The Teeming Marquis was a royal member of the Teeming Sea Tribe and one of its fierce generals. He had previously led an army of millions to eradicate several lineages. Rumor has it that wherever his army went, not even a single blade of grass would be left. They didn’t only eat their enemies but also all vegetation. Anything with life would be completely chewed up.</p>
 <p>Not long ago, Li Qiye had killed a group of Teeming Fish. These fish were the marquis’ soldiers. The marquis was famous for his brutality in the Jade Sea, so he was infuriated when someone publicly ate his soldiers and dragon tendons. Thus, he declared that he would make Li Qiye suffer!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye caught a quick glimpse of the attendant before slowly closing his eyes again.</p>
 <p>The attendant didn’t pursue the matter. If it wasn’t for the marquis’ declaration, he would have taken this brat’s head already.</p>
 <p>He snorted and left. Not long after, he selected a hill. The cultivator here saw that he wanted it and quickly gathered his stuff and handed over the land. This smart cultivator made the attendant’s expression much better. His prestige was still there, very few people in the forest would dare to provoke his authority.</p>
 <p>The sea creatures didn’t dare to appear. Whether they be crabs or fish, all were hiding since they could sense the terrifying murderous intent from the large number of cultivators present.</p>
 <p>As the day of blossoming approached, the cultivators became more and more quiet in anticipation. They would take action the moment the needlefish came out and immediately retreat after catching the first batch.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the coral flowers were about to blossom. The entire forest turned silent like the calm before the storm. The little buds finally came out from these flowers. All of them had different colors in the center, making them resemble stars.</p>
 <p>Many beautiful flowers bloomed throughout the entire forest in a quiet yet spectacular manner. To see these flowers blooming at the same time was quite shocking and difficult to describe with words.</p>
 <p>In a short amount of time, the star-like buds of different colors made this entire area look like a magnificent galaxy, pulling at the spectators’ heartstrings.</p>
 <p>Everyone held their breaths since they didn’t want to break this beautiful serenity while the millions of coral flowers blossomed. In this moment, many people felt that they were immersed in a sea of stars and became in touch with just how vast this world truly was.</p>
 <p>Eventually, all the flower buds finally came out. The pollen began to shed from the flowers’ core and drifted away with the current. Shortly after, this colorful pollen dyed everything with their shades. The entire area was gorgeous and spectacular.</p>
 <p>The crowd became even more nervous while gazing at the Bottomless Trench. They were all waiting for the needlefish to appear.</p>
 <p>Only Li Qiye remained calm on his hill without even bothering to look at the trench.</p>
 <p>“Crash!” Finally, the sea current surged with waves. The coral forest’s water began to move violently as well.</p>
 <p>They saw silver shadows rushing out from the trench. The moment these shadows appeared, a net was cast over the sky above the coral forest.</p>
 <p>Upon a closer inspection, these shadows were fish swimming for the coral flowers. This was the meaning behind their name. Each of them was as small as a needle and their eyes were even smaller than sesame seeds.</p>
 <p>Their speed was quite frightening, like a meteor flashing by. Because of this, when they rushed out, the net immediately blotted out the forest.</p>
 <p>Someone shouted after seeing them: “Needlefish!” The rest of the crowd got ready.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” However, someone screamed before anyone took action. A weak cultivator wanted to catch these fish, but he couldn’t stop these fast creatures. When a big flock of them rushed over, they pierced him and turned him into a sieve in their quick frenzy.</p>
 <p>At this time, everyone else shouted and immediately maneuvered against these fish in order to catch them!</p>
 <p>The majority of cultivators came prepared. One took out a huge net and instantly covered many of the fish. This net was a great treasure, but he couldn’t pull it back. He was stuck in the net as well and was pulled by the fish all the way down the Bottomless Trench…</p>
 <p>Gongsun Qianer, Dao Attendant Lin, and Yan Yanglong finally took action. They all came from imperial lineages, so they were quite powerful. They caught a large group of fish right away, unlike the other cultivators here.</p>
 <p>In this fashion, cultivators were busy catching these fish. However, more were still rushing out from the trench in an endless manner as if they wanted to crush this whole region.</p>
 <p>The ones that weren’t caught crazily ate the pollen from the flowers. They were like rampaging winds; wherever they went, the initially colorful seawater would turn clear again. It was quite a majestic scene.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s location was quite far from the trench. Although some fish managed to break through the barricade, there weren’t many of them that came to this place to eat. Li Qiye continued to ignore them by sitting there.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” While everyone was trying to catch these fish, the current became turbulent. A group of sea demons split the water to come to this place. This new group resembled an army more than a school of fish.</p>
 <p>“Get out of the way! Scram!” They came with an aggressive momentum. Anyone who stood in their path was instantly killed and their blood dyed the water red.</p>
 <p>“Teeming Fish! It is the marquis!” A cultivator screamed after seeing the army that consisted of tens of thousands of fish and quickly retreated.</p>
 <p>In a short moment, this army of sea demons completely surrounded Li Qiye’s hill with several layers of fish.</p>
 <p>A chilling aura pervaded this region with the arrival of this demon army.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1200: Teeming Marquis</b></p>
 <p>The atmosphere of the coral forest was strained to the extreme after being invaded by the mass of Teeming Fish. Even those who were catching needlefish stopped in their tracks.</p>
 <p>Many were frightened at the sight of the nearly 100,000 Teeming Fish surrounding the hills nearby. They quickly left this troubled location in order to stay safe.</p>
 <p>In terms of individual strength, these fish were not that strong. Many cultivators were confident in killing an ordinary fish in a one-on-one. However, their sheer numbers made them dreadful.</p>
 <p>Killing one Teeming Fish would be the same as provoking thousands or even hundreds of thousands of Teeming Fish. This was the most frightening matter.</p>
 <p>“Someone is about to be very unlucky.” A cultivator murmured after seeing the fish encircling Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye still didn’t open his eyes despite being completely trapped.</p>
 <p>One person stepped out at this time. It was a Teeming Fish in full human form.</p>
 <p>In this great army, very few fish had a human form. Although a few of them were very strong, they still had characteristics of fish remaining. For example, some had two hands and a human head, but their body was still that of a fish. As for others, they only had a human’s head… The majority of them were still in fish form.</p>
 <p>The humanoid expert wore armor and had an imposing demeanor. He emitted a powerful aura and a bloodthirsty glare. His entire being gave off the smell of blood as if he had bathed in it, resulting in a chilling air.</p>
 <p>“Teeming Marquis.” A person shuddered after seeing him.</p>
 <p>This was a noble of the Teeming Tribe. It was said that he had several hundred thousand troops, and this number might have reached the millions mark. He was a marquis that recently rose to prominence in their tribe and was notorious for his cruelty.</p>
 <p>“You are the brat that ate dragon tendons!” He stared at Li Qiye with bloodthirst in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye finally opened his eyes. However, he was not looking at the Teeming Marquis but at one particular needlefish.</p>
 <p>Although millions of these fish were trapped in this forest by cultivators, some still made it to this particular region and were crazily devouring the pollen in the water.</p>
 <p>This fish was not that much different from the others. If one had to point something out, it would be that this fish had a pair of feelers that others didn’t. They were extremely small, one on each side and were quite difficult to see even upon carefully scrutinizing it.</p>
 <p>The other needlefish were eating the pollen in the water, but this one was eating the insect powder that Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen ground and scattered on the ground.</p>
 <p>The marquis was not happy at being scorned by Li Qiye, so his expression turned sour.</p>
 <p>He smiled cruelly: “Ignorant brat, today, I will show you a fate worse than death!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye finally turned back to look at the marquis and slowly said: “Run now and I’ll spare your dog life. Otherwise, I will massacre the entire Teeming Tribe in the future.”</p>
 <p>The crowd was speechless after hearing this. People looked at each other and felt that this statement was too outrageous.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured: “He’s not afraid of biting his tongue while bragging at all.”</p>
 <p>Over the millions of years, a few people had made this claim that they would destroy the Teeming Tribe. Some had even attacked their lairs, but in the end, they couldn’t wipe out this race due to its great numbers.</p>
 <p>But now, this human junior was making this claim. This was simply not knowing the immensity of the heaven and earth and, in the eyes of the spectators, being too naive.</p>
 <p>“Which hole did this kid come out from? He doesn’t know how terrifying the Teeming Fish are.” A cultivator shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Good, good, good.” The marquis actually smiled instead of becoming angry. He turned back to the tens of thousands of fish behind him and shouted: “My children, did you hear that? This little animal says he wants to destroy our tribe!”</p>
 <p>Boisterous laughter immediately resounded. All the fish started laughing and felt that there couldn’t be a better joke than this.</p>
 <p>“Well, since this animal dares to make this claim, we don’t need to be polite anymore.” The marquis smilingly said: “Children, it is time to eat. Remember, one bite per person, but don’t kill him just yet. Peck his flesh but let him survive, I want to torture him!”</p>
 <p>“Affirmative!” All of the Teeming Fish shouted and immediately rushed towards Li Qiye like hungry sharks.</p>
 <p>At this time, they didn’t try to attack him with lightning, they wanted him to feel his flesh being torn apart so that he would suffer the agonizing pain.</p>
 <p>The marquis exposed a cruel smile as his horde rushed towards Li Qiye. In his mind, it would only take an instant for Li Qiye to be eaten by his underlings until only his bones were left, letting him survive with only a single breath remaining.</p>
 <p>That would be when he would use the most vicious method to let this brat live on. His wails would echo across the entire region.</p>
 <p>The cultivators here couldn’t bear to watch. They could already see the brutal scene and Li Qiye’s miserable end. However, some of them were gloating as well. They believed that this human junior was courting death. He chose to barge into hell instead of heading for heaven. Opposing the Teeming Fish would bring about a genocide.</p>
 <p>“Mere ants wanting to commit suicide!” Li Qiye was too lazy to look at the fish for his eyes were still fixated on that one needlefish.</p>
 <p>Right when all the fish rushed over and were about to attack Li Qiye, Li Qiye spread out his palm and coldly declared: “Die!”</p>
 <p>A huge black hole emerged from his palm, engulfing all of the Teeming Fish like a tidal wave.</p>
 <p>The black hole twisted all the fish into fleshy suds before swallowing them whole.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Screams shrieked left and right. Before the Teeming Fish knew what was happening, all of them were devoured by the black hole without even leaving behind a corpse.</p>
 <p>Myriad Dao Fist, Heaven Devourer Evil Fist. This was based on the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique. The moment it came out, the fish were no different from moths flying towards a flame. It was an attack that resembled a shark capable of swallowing everything while the Teeming Fish were only tiny prey barely enough to satiate the fist’s appetite.</p>
 <p>This reversal shocked everyone, including the Teeming Marquis. In the next second, his body was up in the air.</p>
 <p>Before the crowd could grasp the situation, Li Qiye was gripping the marquis by the neck. This only took a split second so no one really saw it happen.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glared at the fish and chillingly uttered: “Just an ant that’s barely at the Heavenly Sovereign level, yet you dare to prance around in front of me?”</p>
 <p>“You…” While spasming, the marquis had difficulty speaking with his neck gripped.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he gasped for breath but didn't change his ferocious nature. He cried out: “Little animal, even if you kill me, my race will not spare you. Our billion-strong armies will tear you into pieces and eradicate your ten clans!”</p>
 <p>Countless people held their breaths while watching this scene. They knew that this was not just an exaggeration, the Teeming Race had established numerous countries in the vast oceans.</p>
 <p>What was even more scary was that they were quite unified. Killing one of their marquises would bring about revenge from these innumerable fish.</p>
 <p>The marquis was not strong by himself, but behind him were hundreds of countries and billions of citizens — this was the scariest part.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be waiting.” Li Qiye smiled and placed his palm on the marquis’ body.</p>
 <p>“Pop!” The marquis let out a shrill scream. His cultivation was destroyed by Li Qiye, thus his true body was revealed. He was a gigantic fish.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s palm ran on the fish’s body, stripping him into thin slices. In the blink of an eye, the skeleton of the fish appeared. One could still see a heart beating inside.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye instantly ripped the dragon tendon from the fish’s backbone, severing it of its life.</p>
 <p>He casually threw the tendon into his mouth and began chewing. He looked around at the other cultivators before swallowing and spoke: “If you see any Teeming Fish, let them know that I, Li Qiye, do not like them. They better scram to the ends of the world to get away from me. Otherwise, not only will I tear them apart, I’ll also eat their dragon tendons as an appetizer for my wine!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1201: Archdevil Armored Shark</b></p>
 <p>Vicious and domineering — these were the two words that people found most appropriate to describe this human boy. Some were truly shaken and couldn’t calm down after this spectacle.</p>
 <p>This was a blatant challenge to the Teeming Tribe. Just how overbearing was this? Not to mention a single cultivator, even a lineage wouldn’t dare to do this.</p>
 <p>But now, the human youth named Li Qiye had killed tens of thousands of soldiers of the Teeming Marquis. Moreover, he even ate the marquis’ tendon in front of the crowd. This was too much to take in.</p>
 <p>“Is he a Virtuous Paragon?” A cultivator calmed down and shuddered: “Even if he isn’t a paragon, he must be a Heaven’s Equal King.” [1. Top level of Heavenly King.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s eyes went back to the needlefish from earlier. It was not bothered at all and continued to eat the insect powder on the ground as if it hadn’t eaten for thousands of years.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother its meal and only quietly watched on. He eventually smiled when this fish swam to the trap he laid out earlier.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” He immediately took action. A bunch of hooks connected to long strings emerged from the seabed.</p>
 <p>These fish hooks shot out with tremendous speed. Not to mention these needlefish, even a powerful expert would have a difficult time evading them. However, this particular fish easily dodged them and maneuvered its way out from the trap with incomparable agility.</p>
 <p>As the fish made its way out from the trap, these failed hooks quickly came together to form a huge net.</p>
 <p>This was the so-called immeasurable net of justice that the needlefish was trying to escape. With a buzz, space was sealed and the net engulfed the fish. [2. A widely-used idiom that is hard to duplicate here. Popularized by Justice Bao.]</p>
 <p>It then disappeared and turned into two reins. Each of the reins hooked onto the feelers on the fish’s cheeks while the ends of the reins were in Li Qiye’s hands.</p>
 <p>“You won’t escape that easily.” He held the reins with both hands and grinned.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” This fish crazily pulled the reins into the Bottomless Trench!</p>
 <p>The impossible happened; this tiny fish actually dragged Li Qiye towards the trench. His body slammed and shattered a lot of coral.</p>
 <p>This violent scene attracted the attention of the many cultivators who were trying to catch the fish.</p>
 <p>“Show yourself!” Li Qiye cried out and channeled a universal law into his reins.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The reins locked onto the feelers of the fish and turned into numerous runes. All of these runes began to rotate as the reins disappeared. Only two great laws were left, acting as huge chains that hooked onto the fish’s cheeks.</p>
 <p>The little fish emitted a blinding light while being suppressed by the two laws. An ancient totem emerged along with a temporal portal. Something rushed out from this portal, seemingly coming from the past to the present.</p>
 <p>When the blinding light disappeared, the needlefish was no longer there. Instead, a gigantic shark appeared before everyone. It had an archaic appearance; its skin was gray and its entire body was equipped with pieces of armor protecting its vital areas.</p>
 <p>Its gaping mouth revealed teeth as sharp as blades. The glints reflecting from them caused people to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>The shark emitted a terrifying aura like that of an awakening primal beast. All the cultivators were frightened by its presence as their legs quivered.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators forgot about their current task of catching needlefish and murmured in a daze: “What is that?”</p>
 <p>“Archdevil Armored Shark...” Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen were shocked as well. If this shark was able to break the chains, it would meet god, kill god; meet devil, kill devil.</p>
 <p>Despite being a disciple of the Void Imperfection School, Ye Tu had only heard of its name and had never seen it before. Meanwhile, the more knowledgeable Teng Jiwen felt a chill inside after seeing the legendary beast. Being able to find such a mythical creature was due to Li Qiye, just how frightening were his abilities?</p>
 <p>The other cultivators here weren’t aware of these facts. They were surprised to see the shark but didn’t know its origin.</p>
 <p>The shark grew tame after being suppressed by the universal laws. Li Qiye then controlled it and jumped on its back. He stood on the beast in a gallant manner.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, you are quite lucky to obtain a pet like this.” At this time, Gongsun Qianer and her followers came over while looking at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Of course, she didn’t know what it was and only assumed that it was a typical sea shark.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only coldly glanced at her without bothering to reply.</p>
 <p>She was once again enraged by this arrogant attitude. She was a trusted assistant back at the Profound Sea Dynasty, someone who could do whatever she wanted. Few juniors dared to act like this in front of her.</p>
 <p>They had a minor conflict prior to this, but now, her murderous intent was incited. However, she restrained herself due to this giant shark.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, how about we make a deal?” She smiled and asked him with an easy-mannered look: “I want to buy this shark, you can name a price.”</p>
 <p>“Not for sale.” Li Qiye had no interest in this transaction with the girl and slowly pulled the two laws back by wrapping them around his palms.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, don’t be so quick to refuse.” She assumed a sincere appearance and pressed on: “My lord is the divine queen of the Profound Sea Dynasty and has a love for rare pets. If you are willing to give up this shark, your future will be quite promising and...”</p>
 <p>Despite her sincere speech, there was arrogance hidden among the words. She was implying that it was her master who wanted the shark.</p>
 <p>The Profound God-Monarch’s concubine, Gongsun Meiyu, liked collecting precious aquatic creatures. Thus, Gongsun Qianer had an idea after seeing this shark: if she were to offer it to her master, she would be loved and held in even higher esteem.</p>
 <p>Of course, she didn’t know the shark’s origin. In her eyes, this was at best only a rare and precious pet.</p>
 <p>“Not interested.” He interrupted her and pulled on the laws to change the direction of the shark.</p>
 <p>This lack of sensibility from Li Qiye made her eyes turn cold. She attacked without any hesitation the moment he turned around.</p>
 <p>A purple light flashed. In this split second, she performed her sneak attack with her phoenix hairpin. The hairpin shot out with incomparable speed in an attempt to kill. It was too fast, everyone could only see a purple glint aiming for Li Qiye’s nape.</p>
 <p>“Careful!” Both Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen shouted after seeing the sudden sneak attack without any warning. It was too late even if they wanted to help.</p>
 <p>In this split second, time seemed to stop with the hairpin that flew towards his neck. It turned out that Li Qiye easily caught it with two fingers.</p>
 <p>Gongsun Qianer was aghast to see her most important life-protecting weapon stopped and quickly tried to recall it. However, it was trapped by Li Qiye’s fingers and wouldn’t budge, so her summoning was useless.</p>
 <p>“Die.” A cold glint flashed across Li Qiye's eyes, a glint that cut straight to the heart.</p>
 <p>“My master is the divine queen!” She knew that the situation wasn’t favorable and screamed out in order to use her backing. However, she had yet to finish speaking when the sound of something being pierced came about. The hairpin had instantly shot through her skull. A bloody hole appeared as a string of blood began to flow.</p>
 <p>Her eyes were still wide open as her body slowly fell down. Not even in her wildest dreams did she expect someone would actually dare to kill her!</p>
 <p>“Junior!” Her followers regained their sanity and shouted at the same time before lunging at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Rawrr!” The shark cried out. With a popping sound, it swallowed all of these followers in one gulp.</p>
 <p>The coral forest went quiet right away. All of the cultivators here felt pressured and glanced at each other. Not long before this, Li Qiye was massacring the Teeming Sea Tribe. Now, he even killed Gongsun Qianer!</p>
 <p>This was not only offending the Teeming Tribe but also the four branches of Gu Chun. What a domineering and arrogant showing!</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin and Yan Yanglong were astonished as well. This was doubly true for the attendant. His heart felt cold since he didn’t expect this human junior to be so powerful!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1202: Untethered Vessel</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored the others and remounted the Archdevil Armored Shark before shouting: “Go!”</p>
 <p>With that, the shark issued a roar and rushed for the Bottomless Trench before disappearing into its dark abyss.</p>
 <p>“What does he want to do?” A while later, many people calmed down and began to murmur among themselves.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu’s and Teng Jiwen’s minds returned as well. It was already too late when they thought about following him. In fact, the two of them couldn’t catch up to the shark’s speed anyway.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu looked at Teng Jiwen and asked: “What is this about?”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen replied by shaking his head: “I don’t know either. His actions aren’t something you and me can speculate. Maybe it has something to do with the Seacrossing Shuttle. We will have to wait until he returns to find out.”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen had learned about the shark from an ancient scroll from his citadel. However, he didn’t truly understand the mysteries involved.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye made the shark go to the deepest part of the trench. Its depth was truly of an unfathomable magnitude. Some even said that there was no bottom. Who knew where its base was located?</p>
 <p>The shark cut through the trench's waves for a long time.</p>
 <p>“Crash!” Eventually, it slammed into a cliff and swiftly rushed inside. At this moment, splashing sounds came about, as if the shark had just leaped out of the sea and into the sky.</p>
 <p>It entered a different space, a lonely space without stars, a sun or a moon; only the coldness of the void existed here. Not even time was present, it was a land of eternal banishment.</p>
 <p>In this chilling space was a huge naval shuttle seemingly capable of freely crossing through the ocean.</p>
 <p>It had an ancient bronze hue, as if it was cast from plain bronze. It had been in this icy void for so long that it was covered with patina and was near the point of rusting.</p>
 <p>This gigantic shuttle had two doors to its left and right with many runes and totems on them. They were too archaic to be understood. Outside of the four doors, nothing else could be found. Alas, the ship wouldn’t be particularly eye-catching if placed anywhere else.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye was attracted by this shuttle. His gaze tightly toured over it before murmuring: “Oh, my Untethered Vessel. How can the world know your worth? Only those who don’t understand your value would call you the ‘Seacrossing Shuttle’!”</p>
 <p>People in the Heaven Spirit World had spotted this vessel before, and not on just one occasion. These people gave it the name Seacrossing Shuttle.</p>
 <p>The name meant that it could be used to traverse through the bottomless trench, but no one knew if this was true or not. [1. Bottomless Trench’s raw is actually Bottomless Marine Trench, but I felt that the sea part was implied already, so its left out.]</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye knew of its real name, the Untethered Vessel! It concealed a great secret involving an ancient race from an unknown era.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye told the armored shark: “Go on, pull it out. I will need it to open the portal.”</p>
 <p>The shark swam before the shuttle. Its armor began to clank as universal laws emerged on them.</p>
 <p>These universal laws came together to form two huge chains that coiled around the Untethered Vessel.</p>
 <p>“Rumble—” The shark dragged the vessel outside. The sounds blaring from the slow process made it seem quite heavy. However, Li Qiye was not in a rush as he patiently waited. This was not the first time this had happened.</p>
 <p>In the past, he had seen through the secret of the armored shark before. Whenever the Seacrossing Shuttle appeared in the Heaven Spirit World, it was Li Qiye forcing the shark to drag it out.</p>
 <p>This was not a simple shark but a type of sealed creature. Because of this, it hid among the needlefish. Of course, the emergence of the shuttle required the shark. In this sense, the shark existed to pull the vessel.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The shark finally dragged the vessel out of this icy void. With the splashing of waves, the vessel entered the Bottomless Trench once again.</p>
 <p>At this time, it was floating in the ocean’s currents. Ordinary people wouldn’t feel anything while standing next to it, but Li Qiye could feel strands of power from the trench entering the vessel.</p>
 <p>He gently patted the shark’s head and took off the laws that were latched onto its cheeks and emotionally said: “Go, maybe you will be able to wait for that day and break through your seal to restore your true form. I will wait for you to pull the Untethered Vessel all the way to the nine heavens towards your desired destination!”</p>
 <p>“Rawrr!” The shark roared towards Li Qiye as if it was very dissatisfied at being forced to carry out this task. Nevertheless, it still didn’t attack Li Qiye. It flipped its great tail and swam into the deepest depths of the trench, disappearing from sight right away.</p>
 <p>The Untethered Vessel slowly rose while continuing forward at a slow speed. Its course ran along the trench, as if it had been predetermined.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye watched without interfering for he knew that acting was useless. Its deep ties with the Bottomless Trench made it impossible to influence, regardless of how powerful the intruders might be.</p>
 <p>Unless the person was powerful enough to move the entire trench, there was no way of changing the vessel’s trajectory. In fact, this was simply impossible. Even a star plucker or a sun-and-moon crusher wouldn’t be able to move the trench.</p>
 <p>The Bottomless Trench was not a simple marine chasm at all.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t wait for the slow vessel. He turned and rushed out of the trench in order to meet up with Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen.</p>
 <p>The duo heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Li Qiye fine and well.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu curiously asked after seeing Li Qiye returning by himself: “Young Noble, where is the Archdevil Armored Shark?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and said: “It has left to go back from whence it came.”</p>
 <p>The two of them were slightly puzzled and curious. After spending so much effort to catch the shark, he actually released it. They had no clue as to what Li Qiye wanted to do.</p>
 <p>“You will find out later.” Li Qiye told the two of them: “Okay, we’ll go back to Shallow Beach for now. I promised that Sunflower geezer that I would teach something to you. Ye Tu, go back and ask your old men about when I will be able to see the ancestral whale.”</p>
 <p>With that, he walked away with the duo right behind him.</p>
 <p>“What is that?” In the next few days, many cultivators were busy catching the needlefish. There were truly too many of them; it seemed impossible to catch them all. Because of this, they became less and less precious.</p>
 <p>On this day, a huge shadow slowly surfaced from the bottomless trench. It was a huge marine shuttle that slowly inched forward.</p>
 <p>In a short amount of time, many people stopped as they watched on in a daze as it floated by.</p>
 <p>“What is this thing?” The crowd was surprised to see the gigantic shuttle.</p>
 <p>These cultivators couldn’t be considered big shots at all. Most of them were ordinary disciples from large and small sects alike. Some were even vagabonds, so they didn’t know what this huge shuttle was.</p>
 <p>“Seacrossing Shuttle!” Eventually, an old cultivator who looked like an old mortal shouted: “It is the legendary Seacrossing Shuttle! It is here again!”</p>
 <p>“What is this Seacrossing Shuttle?” Other cultivators were still lost after hearing this old man. They had never heard this name before, let alone knowing what it was about.</p>
 <p>“According to legend, the Seacrossing Shuttle can reach the ‘Charming Fragmented Realm’!”</p>
 <p>“Charming Fragmented Realm…” Dao Attendant Lin and Yan Yanglong from the great lineages were astounded to hear this. They finally knew what this ship ahead was.</p>
 <p>They turned and left in order to send messages to their sects about the appearance of the shuttle.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1203: Charming Fragmented Realm</b></p>
 <p>News of the shuttle's appearance quickly spread across the entire Jade Sea to the corners of the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were moved by this information. Many great lineages sent disciples to the coral forest. They had their own speculations regarding this matter. Of course, there were some sects who had no interest in this matter and didn’t send out any disciples.</p>
 <p>A sect master from a lineage that was interested in the matter murmured: “Wow, the Seacrossing Shuttle is back. It is capable of reaching the fragmented realm and hasn't appeared for generations. What is the meaning behind this? Does this mean that some mysteries will be solved?”</p>
 <p>In a powerful lineage that didn’t want to participate, an old Virtuous Paragon shook his head and said: “So what about the shuttle? And the same goes for the fragmented realm. It would be a fruitless trip since that place has already become mere ruins.”</p>
 <p>An expert under his faction spoke: “But I heard when Immortal Emperor Gu Chun was young, he went there and obtained a supreme fortune, the source of the charming spirits.” [1. Remember that Gu Chun was the first emperor and made an appearance in the second side story. His title means Ancient Purity.]</p>
 <p>The paragon laughed in response: “That is a matter of the past — the Desolate Era. Regardless of whether the emperor obtained something amazing or not, it is a relic of the distant past. Countless generations have gone by since his era and the shuttle has appeared many more times, but until now, no one has ever heard of someone else getting anything from there. It is a forsaken land, nothing is there.”</p>
 <p>Despite a few big shots believing that there was nothing at the Charming Fragmented Realm, other experts still moved to explore it.</p>
 <p>In fact, imperial lineages treated this matter with great importance, especially the ones from the Charming Spirit Race. They sent experts there in a very low-key manner. Most of them concealed their identities while trying to discover a method of entry.</p>
 <p>The charming spirits were especially interested in this because one of their wise sages had speculated that this realm had countless ties with their race. Some even claimed that it had to do with their origin.</p>
 <p>The shuttle signified the path to the fragmented realm. Generations of charming spirit sages had researched this place, but no one knew what was within.</p>
 <p>Because of this, many assumed that it was a forsaken wasteland of an abandoned ancient battlefield.</p>
 <p>Regardless of these beliefs, more and more people kept an eye out for the shuttle that was slowly rising from the trench while moving forward.</p>
 <p>There had been some changes to the shuttle after its appearance. One of the four portals carved on its hull was slowly lighting up. It seemed that the shuttle was absorbing the power of the trench in order to open this particular portal.</p>
 <p>However, this process was very slow. The runes on the door continued to shine as if it was unlocking its shackles.</p>
 <p>A paragon from the previous generation saw the current situation of the shuttle and commented: “The portal is about to open. When the entire door lights up, the portal will be usable and the fragmented realm will be right beyond it.”</p>
 <p>As several more days passed, this door finally lit up completely. All the runes and totems continuously wove together to form a bright portal.</p>
 <p>“The dao portal has been formed, we can go to the Charming Fragmented Realm now.” The cultivators who had been paying attention were slightly stunned by the portal’s emergence, but they quickly calmed down.</p>
 <p>“Let us go.” An old Virtuous Paragon personally took the lead and disappeared into the portal. His sect’s disciples hurriedly entered as well.</p>
 <p>“We’ll go as well, we will be the second Immortal Emperor Gu Chun once we obtain the incredible fortune within!” Many cultivators quickly disappeared into the portal as well.</p>
 <p>In fact, the majority of them had never been here before. It was the legend of the young Immortal Emperor Gu Chun that drew them here. They ignored everything and let caution to the wind as they decided to enter first.</p>
 <p>After many rushed into the fragmented realm, Li Qiye and the two boys finally arrived.</p>
 <p>“The Seacrossing Shuttle is just as the legend states.” The duo was shaken to see the shuttle with their own eyes.</p>
 <p>They suddenly had this thought at the same time: the shuttle’s appearance must have something to do with Li Qiye and the armored shark.</p>
 <p>But as for the details, they wouldn’t dare ask the quiet Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>After seeing the formed portal, Ye Tu asked: “Will this door lead to the mythical fragmented realm?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded: “This is the only path. Without it, people will never be able to reach that realm.”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen looked at Ye Tu and said: “I also heard that the fragmented realm has a lot to do with charming spirits.” As a treant, he didn’t care too deeply about this realm.</p>
 <p>“Only the heavens know.” Ye Tu scratched his head in response: “It is only a legend, especially the one regarding Immortal Emperor Gu Chun and his great fortune. Who knows if it is real or not? Outside of the emperor, no one has ever heard of someone gaining anything from there for millions of years now.”</p>
 <p>“If your forefathers heard this, they might beat your head off.” Li Qiye looked at him and said: “I don’t know if others obtained treasures or not, but your patriarch, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou, obtained an extremely heaven-defying treasure from there.”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Ye Tu was stunned. He thought about a few rumors in his sect and began to stammer: “This… this is difficult to believe… Can it be that our, our item is actually from the Charming Fragmented Realm?”</p>
 <p>“Correct.” Li Qiye looked at the Seacrossing Shuttle, no, the Untethered Vessel, and said: “Your patriarch personally visited the fragmented realm after becoming an emperor and obtained an incredible item. It is just that future generations weren’t privy to this. On the other hand, what Immortal Emperor Gu Chun’s achieved in his youth was told for ages.”</p>
 <p>“What did Immortal Emperor Wu Gou obtain from there?” Teng Jiwen became quite curious.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu answered with some uncertainty: “I don’t know too well, but I heard the ancestors say that… it might be the Void Imperfection Spring.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he looked over at Li Qiye in search of an answer.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and stared at the shuttle.</p>
 <p>“The Seacrossing Shuttle has four doors.” Teng Jiwen changed the subject after seeing that Li Qiye had no intention of responding and asked: “Right now, only one portal has been formed. Will the other three doors turn into portals as well?”</p>
 <p>“It is no longer important.” Li Qiye shook his head and replied: “Each portal is equal to a world, that’s all you need to know.”</p>
 <p>“Will they open then?” Teng Jiwen was a bit surprised: “According to our records, the shuttle only leads to the fragmented realm.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied: “There are too many things people don’t know in this world.”</p>
 <p>Ye Tu glanced at the shuttle and asked: “Where do they lead?”</p>
 <p>“They have never been opened.” Li Qiye slowly spoke: “As for their destinations, who knows? The world will find out once they open. Of course, that day might never come.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye knew full well that it wasn’t easy to open the other three doors of the shuttle. In fact, when the time was ripe, they would open by themselves. However, everything would change when that day comes…</p>
 <p>Li Qiye spoke: “Come, let us enter. After finding what I need, I will still have to see your ancestral whale.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, the duo was quite moved because the whale of the Void Imperfection Three Schools was too mysterious and full of legends. However, few had seen it. At the very least, they were not qualified to see it.</p>
 <p>The two of them followed him into the portal.</p>
 <p>A world unraveled before them. It was a fragmented world full of questions.</p>
 <p>Here, the mountains were either shattered or torn asunder. The earth was split by shocking scars everywhere. Even the oceans here had boiled into deserts. Up in the sky, gigantic peaks had been pulled down by universal laws. Enormous stars from up above fell onto the ground.</p>
 <p>From these individual scenes, one could imagine the horrifying events that transpired here. It could have been a natural disaster or a heaven-shattering war!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1204: The World Beneath The Creek</b></p>
 <p>In this broken realm, Teng Jiwen and Ye Tu had different feelings. They couldn’t explain it clearly, but they felt that they were overwhelmed with indescribable emotions.</p>
 <p>It was difficult to point out whether this was a happy or sad emotion amidst their confusion. This was especially true for Ye Tu; this sentiment continued to linger within him.</p>
 <p>“It is affecting your instincts.” Li Qiye explained while the two were still uncertain. He then looked at Ye Tu and said: “You are a charming spirit, so this is even more intense for you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Tu had to ask: “Is this place really related to our race?”</p>
 <p>Though this was his first visit here, he had heard his seniors talking about it before. Their wise sages had made a prediction. Because of this, experts from their race had entered this place many times throughout history. Even their Void Imperfect Three Schools had explored this place, but all left without great results.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye maintained his mysterious smile instead of giving an answer. He looked at the horizon and said: “Let’s go, there is a place we must reach.”</p>
 <p>With that, he took the first step forward. The two boys quickly gave chase.</p>
 <p>The group took their time. Along their journey, many people from all over the world could be seen entering the realm.</p>
 <p>The majority of the cultivators here were eager to find treasures or fortunes among the ruins. Because of this, people were digging deep into the ground or using their divine intents to sweep through the mountains and rivers. Some were climbing to higher places while others drilled into the earth in their search.</p>
 <p>Because of the legend of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun, knowing that nothing might come of this trip didn’t deter people’s enthusiasm and interest. Everyone dreamed of becoming the second Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.</p>
 <p>Cultivators dug one mountain after another and plowed the land to no avail. They didn’t find anything at all, let alone a great fortune. One of them complained: “The Charming Fragmented Realm is truly a wasteland, there is nothing here.”</p>
 <p>“How could it be so easy to find a great fortune? It wouldn’t be called a fortune if it was easily found.” His friend smiled and comforted him: “You know, since the start of time, how many people were like Immortal Emperor Gu Chun? He was the only one! The first emperor of the nine worlds! The first Immortal Emperor! If his fortune came so easily, he wouldn’t have been the first emperor.”</p>
 <p>After hearing his friend, the cultivator regained his spirits and continued to look for fortunes and treasures.</p>
 <p>The legend was a great moving force for these adventurers. They continued to look over and over again without giving up. In their minds was the image of the first emperor of the nine worlds, the pride of the charming spirits — Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.</p>
 <p>After seeing the fruitless searches of the other cultivators, Ye Tu asked Li Qiye: “Is this a forsaken land? Did it used to hide a great secret?”</p>
 <p>Although Li Qiye had mentioned his progenitor’s success at finding a supreme treasures in this place, the later generations had never heard of someone else who found something, not even a piece of scrap metal.</p>
 <p>“Who says a secret realm must have treasures and fortunes?” Li Qiye looked at the youth and smilingly replied: “Must the forefathers bury treasures or leave behind fortunes in this place so that the future generations can come to find them?”</p>
 <p>“But, but Immortal Emperor Gu Chun really did receive a fortune in this place.” Ye Tu hesitated a bit before replying.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “Because he is Immortal Emperor Gu Chun. It’s just as these people have been repeating, how many were similar to him since the start of time? Nobody, since only one could become the first emperor.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he pointed at this head and continued: “In this place, items, treasures, and even fortunes — none of these matter. The crucial part is here. If you can understand, you will have a harvest; if you can’t, then there is nothing worth remembering in this place. It will be a wasteland like the people say.”</p>
 <p>Ye Tu interjected: “Young Noble, our progenitor found something here as well.”</p>
 <p>“Why is it that Immortal Emperor Wu Gou could find something but others can’t?” Li Qiye smiled: “This place is different from the other locations, including the twelve burial grounds. The burial grounds are places with buried treasures, but it would be a huge mistake to use that logic here.”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen asked: “How is this place different from the others?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye pondered for a moment with a forlorn gaze before answering insipidly: “In a distant age, it supported an entire race. And it’s not just this land, the shuttle that you both call the Seacrossing Shuttle is included as well. It signified endless hope.”</p>
 <p>“Endless hope?” Teng Jiwen murmured. This casual sentence from Li Qiye left him with an everlasting aftertaste.</p>
 <p>“If you can understand this, then you will become the second Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.” Li Qiye looked at Teng Jiwen who was trying to make sense of this.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen coughed and said: “Sir, you are messing with me. I am a treant, so I can’t become an Immortal Emperor.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and replied: “You are right, but understanding the meaning of this place will grant you a lifetime of benefits even if you are a treant.”</p>
 <p>The youth shook his head: “Sir, you think too highly of me. As everyone said before, Immortal Emperor Gu Chun is unique. As for me… even though my talents aren’t bad, I am only an insect compared to the emperors. I know my own worth very well.”</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen was telling the truth. As the successor of the Heavenvine Citadel, his talents weren’t bad at all. He wasn’t looking down on himself either, it was just that he knew he was far from being comparable to the emperors.</p>
 <p>The group walked for a long time before they reached a waterfall. It was pouring down from a cliff so high that it seemed to be falling from the sky.</p>
 <p>Its current flowed along the terrain, but its stream was divided into several smaller creeks even over yonder.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye picked a creek and waded into the water with the two youths. The next second, they sank to the bottom.</p>
 <p>At this time, he took out a sea clam, the one that he caught at the Bottomless Trench. He threw it into the creek and said: “Go, you can find your way home by yourself.”</p>
 <p>Afterwards, he turned towards the duo and warned: “Follow my footsteps closely, do not make the slightest mistake.”</p>
 <p>His serious expression made the boys shudder. They didn’t dare to be careless and quickly nodded.</p>
 <p>The clam began to move while wiggling at the bottom of the creek. The pearl within emitted a golden light as if it was guiding the way.</p>
 <p>It left behind a faint trace of light. Li Qiye followed it step by step in a very meticulous manner. He knew that one misstep would ruin all of his efforts and that he would have to start all over again.</p>
 <p>The duo behind Li Qiye was even more careful. They nervously followed right behind Li Qiye and stepped on his footprints without daring to be careless.</p>
 <p>At first, they felt that there was nothing special here. The current of the creek continued to flow with fishes and shrimps swimming about.</p>
 <p>However, they suddenly realized that the space around them was a mirage. Suddenly this was an ancient path, no longer the simple path of the creek.</p>
 <p>This path led all the way to the sky. They walked upward as if this was a process to ascend to deityhood. However, they saw some terrifying scenes.</p>
 <p>In this space, they saw unbelievably gigantic warships. They hovered in space like stars and each of them could carry continents spanning millions and millions of miles.</p>
 <p>Such warships had been destroyed. Some were split in two while others had huge holes that went straight through them. Others had uneven gaps while more were shattered nearly to the point of being unrecognizable…</p>
 <p>Amidst their daze, they saw countless fragments floating in space, the fragments were bits of cracked sabers, broken swords, and fragmented axes…</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they saw skeletons. Some of the skeletons were enormous, as if they were huge monsters that still had a golden glow to them...</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1205: Mysterious Statue</b></p>
 <p>The duo was jolted after seeing all of these spectacles. They couldn’t tell reality from illusion or even if they were actually in this strange place or not.</p>
 <p>“Stabilize your mind or you will never be able to come back.” Suddenly, Li Qiye’s voice rang in their minds like a wake-up call. Their lucidity returned as they sobered up.</p>
 <p>They found that they were still down in the creek. The current was still quietly flowing along with the little creatures swimming about as if nothing had changed.</p>
 <p>The three continued on this path for an unknown period of time.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Li Qiye led them out of the creek. A gentle breeze brushed by and startled them. They found themselves on a flat plain, but just like before, they couldn’t determine if this place was real or not.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, they didn’t go too far before walking to a pile of rubble. Countless bits of gravel were scattered on the ground, but upon careful observation, they turned out to be pieces of stone statues.</p>
 <p>The rubble was quite sizable. As they went on deeper into the plain, the two looked at some of the broken statues. They had been destroyed beyond repair. There was simply no way of knowing what they used to look like. The two had a hard time imagining what had actually happened here in the past.</p>
 <p>Eventually, they reached the inner part of these ruins and found a complete statue. It was quite tall, more than ten meters high. It had stood strong for countless eras, but these eras left their mark on it. Under the polishing of the years, it had become a bit gray.</p>
 <p>Its slender contours and elegant clothing indicated that this was a statue of a woman.</p>
 <p>However, the facial features of the statue had grown blurry under the polishing of countless years. There was no way to see through its facial features. Such a statue resembled something carved out of snow, slowly melting away with the passing of time. The vague lines and contours of the statue caused the woman's face to remain a mystery.</p>
 <p>The duo gazed at it carefully. They didn’t know whether the statue was initially like this or if it had been weathered by time, or if something else had happened to it.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood before the statue without speaking. He stared at it in a daze, not blinking for a long time.</p>
 <p>The other two couldn’t figure out what was so captivating about the statue or why Li Qiye was so fascinated by it. Nevertheless, they didn’t dare to disturb him.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye turned around and asked: “Are you two all right?”</p>
 <p>The two were surprised and wryly chuckled in their minds. They should be the ones asking Li Qiye this. It was Li Qiye who stood there looking at the statue in a daze, not them.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu shook his head and replied: “I’m fine.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled a little while looking at two without saying anything.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen asked: “Sir, earlier, was it real or fake?”</p>
 <p>“What are you referring to?” Li Qiye clarified.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen found that Li Qiye’s response was quite strange, as if they had incongruous viewpoints.</p>
 <p>“The things we saw in the creek earlier.” He elaborated despite his slight confusion.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and replied: “Whether the images are real or fake depends on your dao heart. Real is fake and fake is real, false is also true and true is also false.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, both the youths were lost in the fog and scratched their heads like confused monks.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye paid no mind to the two and took out a jade bowl. He whispered to it and performed a complex and strange ritual. It was a very ancient rite with a purpose unknown to even Teng Jiwen.</p>
 <p>He whispered for a bit and the ceremony ended with him raising the jade bowl over his head.</p>
 <p>At this time, one could hear the splashing of water. Two very small streams of water fell down from above, into his bowl.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu murmured: “The statue is crying...” The two of them looked up to see tears coming out of the statue.</p>
 <p>They were quite moved and stood there in a daze. They suddenly saw an illusion of the statue being alive. At this point, it was not something made out of stone or marble, it was a living being sealed in this location.</p>
 <p>At this point, they could no longer tell the nature of this statue before them.</p>
 <p>Once Li Qiye’s bowl was filled, the tears stopped and Li Qiye carefully put it away.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu curiously asked: “Young Noble, what is that?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the statue and said: “Mortal Tears, the tears of compassion and pity for the common people. It can stimulate someone’s desire for life.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye came for this bowl of tears in order to replenish the Peacock Tree’s life.</p>
 <p>He glanced at the statue and said: “Let’s go. We have obtained what we needed, there’s no point in insisting on something we can’t obtain.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned and left with the duo trailing behind him. They exited the heap of rubble.</p>
 <p>“What a shame.” Li Qiye spoke from the lead: “I thought the two of you would be able to see something after coming here or at least obtain a little fortune. It seems like this was not meant to be.”</p>
 <p>“A fortune?” Both of them were surprised. They thought he only came for the Mortal Tears.</p>
 <p>“Yes, a kind of opportunity.” Li Qiye explained: “If you two were fated, then you would have been able to see something, especially about these statues. Alas, there were no such visions. This means that it was not predestined.”</p>
 <p>Their eyes darted to each other. At this time, they realized why Li Qiye was being so abstruse earlier. After realizing this, the two quickly turned around. However, the ruins were no more and even the flat plain was gone. There was only a vast emptiness.</p>
 <p>This sudden development badly frightened the two. From start to finish, they didn’t know that they were standing in the void. They couldn’t believe their own eyes at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look, one can’t force a missed opportunity.” Li Qiye flatly said while walking in front.</p>
 <p>The two felt regretful after hearing this. They didn’t know that they had given up an opportunity, one that was skirting next to them.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu couldn’t help but ask: “Are there any other fortunes and opportunities here?”</p>
 <p>“It is different for everyone, so what they meet is different as well. There is no way of forcing this matter. Your inability to see the fortune means that you haven’t reached the necessary level.” He turned to look at Ye Tu: “However, in this place, there is a higher number of opportunities for the charming spirits.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Ye Tu suddenly connected the dots and blurted out: “Young Noble, are you saying that the young Immortal Emperor Gu Chun also came to this place?!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled without replying.</p>
 <p>The two were lamenting. After all, they had missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye spoke: “There’s no need to feel bad, it isn’t something that can be forced. Not everyone can become Immortal Emperor Gu Chun, there is nothing you can do about it.”</p>
 <p>The two of them could only sigh. Li Qiye had already shown great kindness by taking the two of them here. It was their own lack of ability that made them miss this chance.</p>
 <p>“Jiwen, I have taught you what I can, so I have done enough for your citadel and that old geezer Sunflower.” Li Qiye continued: “But as for Ye Tu, since you have been helping me out and took the time to come here, I will help you obtain something.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Ye Tu hurriedly answered: “To assist Young Noble is what I should do. If I dared to neglect my duty, the schoolmaster would have broken my bones. How could I dare to seek something from you?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently waved his hand and said: “Every cause has an effect; I will not let people who help me do so for nothing. It would be foolish to not take readily available treasures, I am only presenting Buddha with borrowed flowers, that’s all.” [1. To win favor or influence using someone else's property.]</p>
 <p>Ye Tu had no response to this and only scratched his head.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen, on the other hand, had nothing to say. He didn’t think that Li Qiye was being unfair. What Li Qiye had passed down to him was more than enough for a lifetime.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1206: Divine Well</b></p>
 <p>The Seacrossing Shuttle traveled along the Bottomless Trench. It slowly floated to the surface but then descended once again, as if it was very slowly returning to the trench.</p>
 <p>It looked like there was a force down there that was connected to the shuttle, not allowing it to leave the ocean or deviate from its route.</p>
 <p>In the last several days, many experts from the great powers ran here. After entering the fragmented realm, they rarely showed themselves again. This was especially true for lineages from the Charming Spirit Race, such as the Void Imperfection Three Schools. They weren’t here for treasures or some intangible and elusive fortunes of legend; their goal was to unravel the mystery. Thus, these experts maintained a low profile and didn’t want others to know about them.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were also those who put on airs such as the Teeming Crown Prince! Ever since he arrived at the broken realm, he arrogantly announced: “The human named Li Qiye, show yourself! Daring to oppose the Teeming Tribe? This prince will eat you alive!”</p>
 <p>Many people stayed far away from the crown prince. They felt creeped out after hearing his desire to eat Li Qiye raw. Everyone knew that in recent days, the Teeming Tribe had been issuing threats.</p>
 <p>The crown prince didn’t bring an army like the others, only ten old men. All of them were experts with human forms that emitted frightening auras. As for the prince, his blood energy was even more vigorous and powerful.</p>
 <p>For the Teeming Tribe, under ordinary conditions, one would be able to fully turn into a human form upon reaching the Heavenly Sovereign realm.</p>
 <p>Someone whispered after hearing the prince’s declaration: “It might be over for Li Qiye. The Teeming Crown Prince is here in person, this shows that the clan is very serious about this. Who would be willing to save him, a human, and offend the entire Teeming Tribe?”</p>
 <p>The crown prince was very different from the Teeming Marquis. Even though the marquis was a noble of the tribe, the position of crown prince was much higher.</p>
 <p>He was the regal firstborn of the Teeming Tribemaster. In the Heaven Spirit World, there were millions upon millions of Teeming Fish that made up a million kingdoms. Of course, this number of kingdoms was greatly exaggerated, but there were at least several thousand!</p>
 <p>The tribemaster had a pivotal position in the tribe. He could even command the billions of fish and thousands of kingdoms in this world.</p>
 <p>Thus, one could extrapolate the crown prince’s great status. Today, when he personally took action for revenge, it truly showed their race’s stance on this matter.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the prince himself was not a useless person. Rumor has it that he was already a Virtuous Paragon. He was quite renowned in this world.</p>
 <p>Some said that he might be weaker than the supreme geniuses such as the Profound God-Monarch or the Seashield Heavenly Prince, but his reputation was still immense.</p>
 <p>Thus, everyone knew that this human junior named Li Qiye was dead for sure after hearing the prince’s desire. Moreover, it would be a very ugly death.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people in a certain location within the broken realm. Some stayed for a long time, unwilling to leave. Among them were many experts.</p>
 <p>In fact, there was nothing particularly remarkable about this place. There was a small pit with an abandoned old well inside. Nothing was worthy of a second glance besides this well.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, this kind of place made many reluctant to leave. Some famous experts were here as well, such as Yan Yanglong and Dao Attendant Lin.</p>
 <p>Outside of these two, some older people stayed here as well. However, characters of this level were hiding their true forms. After arriving, they didn’t move an inch from this place.</p>
 <p>Despite deliberately masking their identities, some people still guessed that these experts were charming spirits. Some were most likely from lineages like the Void Imperfection Three Schools.</p>
 <p>Only such lineages would pay attention to this place. This location only garnered even more interest because of this. Even though many people were full of interest towards this place, no one dared to act rashly or presumptuously due to the undercover big shots.</p>
 <p>There were rumors that this was an abandoned divine well with holy water. However, for some unknown reason, the well dried up and the water disappeared.</p>
 <p>In spite of this, each time the shuttle appeared, the big shots from the Charming Spirit Race would come here to research this well. They wanted to use this as an entry point to figure out the secrets of this realm.</p>
 <p>Some said that the Void Imperfection Three Schools paid the most attention to this well. Their experts would personally come here each time to explore it.</p>
 <p>Because of this, people speculated that these old men concealing their identities were from the three schools.</p>
 <p>Among the younger generation, Yan Yanglong and Daoist Attendant Lin, who were quite famous, were staying in order to see if any divine water would start to flow.</p>
 <p>For those from the great lineages, they had access to records left behind in their sects. They stated that this well was one of the most notable locations in the fragmented realm.</p>
 <p>That went double for the dao attendant due to the belief that the water here had a great effect on those who cultivated the Void Imperfection Physique.</p>
 <p>The two youths came closer and took a good look. However, nothing came of it. The well was dried up and there was no water, just as the legend claimed.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, both the young and old continued to stay. The two youths hoped that these great characters could figure something out. Perhaps by lingering around, they would be able to pick up some benefits afterward.</p>
 <p>“That fierce person who ate dragon tendons is here!” At this time, someone shouted, resulting in a great commotion.</p>
 <p>A lot of people turned and saw Li Qiye slowly walking closer with two lads behind him.</p>
 <p>His arrival attracted the attention of both Yan Yanglong and Dao Attendant Lin. A few big shots who were shrouding their appearances looked over as well.</p>
 <p>Many people made way for him. This was not because they were afraid of Li Qiye, but because the Teeming Crown Prince had expressed his desire to eat Li Qiye alive. Many people considered him as a plague. No one wanted to catch his unluckiness.</p>
 <p>“It’s crazy to eat dragon tendons in public.” Despite knowing his ultimate fate of being torn apart by the Teeming Tribe and becoming the prince’s food, some were still secretly admiring him.</p>
 <p>In this world, how many people would dare to feast on tendons so blatantly? How many people would dare to provoke the Teeming Tribe like this? His domineering and arrogant style was indeed worthy of admiration.</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin’s eyes flashed with a cold glint after seeing Li Qiye. He had been wanting to kill Li Qiye long ago, but after seeing how Li Qiye killed Gongsun Qianer, he felt some hesitation. Without knowing Li Qiye’s true strength, he wouldn’t carelessly move against him.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, he quietly called for a disciple and ordered him to go tell the Teeming Crown Prince. As long as the prince came, this boy would die without a doubt!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked around lazily. His eyes darted to the big shots hiding their true forms and smiled: “You’re all here to see if there is any Void Imperfection Spring Water? Don’t be too greedy about certain things.”</p>
 <p>These big shots didn’t say anything and just stood there calmly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t say anything else and jumped into the divine well for a better look.</p>
 <p>It was only a pit. If one really wanted to point out something extraordinary in this common well, then it would be the slight protrusion on one of the walls that resembled the mouth of an eagle. Nothing else was notable.</p>
 <p>In fact, many people had jumped down before Li Qiye for a better look. They used their divine intent to sweep through this place over and over, but nothing was found.</p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong standing above the divine well sneered and said: “Countless charming spirit wise sages have pried at it with divine mirrors to find anything at all. Trying to see through the mystery with the naked eye is mere wishful thinking.”</p>
 <p>He had no grievances or feuds with Li Qiye. Someone from the Extreme Yang School like him didn’t need to bother a human boy, it was just that he didn’t like looking at Li Qiye’s arrogant and imperious attitude.</p>
 <p>In his eyes, even his master, the Extreme Yang Monarch, didn’t act as haughty as this. What grounds did this human boy have to act like this?!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1207: Void Imperfection Water</b></p>
 <p>After doing his round down in the well, Li Qiye turned his head and coldly glared at Yan Yanglong before smiling to say: “Don’t use the wise sages of the Charming Spirit Race to make yourself feel better. Just be straight and say that you couldn’t find anything even after using a divine mirror. People are stupid to some extent, everyone knows this so no one will laugh at you specifically.”</p>
 <p>To be publicly ridiculed like this left Yan Yanglong humiliated. His master could deter the entire Jade Sea and he himself was more or less famous.</p>
 <p>“Naive fool, such a big tone.” Yan Yanglong knew that Li Qiye was not weak after seeing his quick dispatch of Gongsun Qianer. However, he couldn’t back down in this situation: “You think you can find some clues alone? How utterly ridiculous!”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Li Qiye lazily replied: “Your demeanor indicates how highly you view yourself. If I can find something from this well, then wouldn’t you lose all face?”</p>
 <p>“If you can make the divine water come out, I won’t say a single word and eat all the mud around this well!” Yan Yanglong felt his temper worsening and sneered.</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin, who was standing with him, joined in with a mocking grin: “Brother Yanglong, aren’t you making things too difficult for him? One would have to be daydreaming to think that a human junior could make divine water come out.”</p>
 <p>At this time, the cultivators on the sidelines only watched and didn’t want to join in this mess. Meanwhile, the real big shots were just watching the fun with amusement.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him with disdain and smiled: “Don’t forget your words, remember to eat all the mud here.”</p>
 <p>“You!” The continuous ridicule left Yan Yanglong with an extremely ugly expression accompanied by murderous flashes in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored him and placed the jade bowl in front of him before sitting down and closing his eyes.</p>
 <p>At this moment, those next to the well were watching with bated breaths. They took note of Li Qiye’s confidence and wanted to see if he could gather divine water or not.</p>
 <p>In fact, they had their own plans. If Li Qiye were to be successful, would they be able to get part of the soup pot as well?</p>
 <p>As for the bet between the two, it had nothing to do with them. After all, most were unwilling to provoke an existence like the Extreme Yang School.</p>
 <p>Both Teng Jiwen and Ye Tu were anxious as well. They wanted to see what kind of miracle Li Qiye could concoct. They believed in him. This was especially true for Teng Jiwen, he had absolute faith in Li Qiye’s ability to make divine water come out.</p>
 <p>As time slowly passed, the well remained calm without any changes.</p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong coldly sneered after seeing this: “If this could lead to divine water, then people would be obtaining treasures everywhere in the Charming Fragmented Realm. Hah, stop pretending and just admit your defeat. Because you are still young, I will be magnanimous and won’t be too hard on you. Just prostrate and bow three times before everyone—”</p>
 <p>“Splash!” Before Yan Yanglong could finish, the sound of water flowing came out. A small pillar of water shot out from the mud inside the well. It resembled a dragon spraying out water and it fell straight into Li Qiye’s jade bowl.</p>
 <p>This divine water rattled like little jewels as it fell into the bowl, resulting in a crisp and pleasant sound. Everyone knew right away that it was an exalted type of water.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the jade bowl was full and the stream of water disappeared as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>Mists that seemed to be divine energy surrounded the jade bowl. This mist slowly rose like the blossoming of a lotus flower crafted from jade. It was beautiful and breathtaking. People’s hearts began to palpitate at its sight.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, the four corners went silent. Everyone stared at this scene in disbelief. Who would have thought that this abandoned well would still have divine water?</p>
 <p>Someone among the hidden masters saw the water inside Li Qiye’s jade bowl and exclaimed: “Void Imperfection Water!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at this group and flatly said: “You already have what you should, to be more covetous is something even the villainous heavens won’t agree to. Must you want everything in this treasure ground?”</p>
 <p>This old man was startled and didn’t say anything else. He bowed to Li Qiye and quietly stood to the side.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Ye Tu, who had turned into a young attendant, was shaken. He immediately understood where these big shots came from.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye handed the bowl full of Void Imperfection Water to Ye Tu and said: “This water is suitable. Even though it is not as plentiful as the Void Imperfection Spring, it is still the same type of water. This bowl will be quite beneficial for you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Tu was jolted. Even though his school had the spring, only a few ancestors were allowed to see it. Ordinary disciples weren’t qualified to do so. Ye Tu accepted the jade bowl and thanked Li Qiye. He had no words to express his gratitude.</p>
 <p>At this time, Dao Attendant Lin put on a humble posture and bowed towards Ye Tu: “My master is the lord of the Immaculate Expanse. His venerable requires a bowl of Void Imperfection Water right away, would brother be willing to sell it…?”</p>
 <p>The dao attendant didn’t dare to ask Li Qiye and went for Ye Tu instead. He had no choice but to act humble because this water was indeed very beneficial to their Void Imperfection Physique.</p>
 <p>The attendant’s words carried quite some weight as well because he was asking on behalf of his master.</p>
 <p>“Where did this trash roll out from?” Li Qiye coldly peered at him and answered before Ye Tu could do anything: “Opposing me yet you still want to talk about business? Scram!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye simply gave no face to his enemies. It was already merciful enough that he hasn’t chopped off his head.</p>
 <p>“You!” Being shouted at by Li Qiye left him with an ugly expression.</p>
 <p>He was trembling with anger, but he didn’t explode. This was him asking for it, but in his mind, the bowl of water was simply too tempting. Despite knowing the inevitable disgraceful outcome, he still had to ask Ye Tu.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the dao attendant, Li Qiye shifted his attention to Yan Yanglong instead and lazily said: “Now, isn’t it time for you to eat all the mud here?”</p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong stumbled backward under Li Qiye’s gaze. He wasn’t looking his best at this moment, but he couldn’t get off the tiger.</p>
 <p>He spoke too harshly earlier, so now, when Li Qiye actually drew out some Void Imperfection Water, he had no other choice. However, he couldn’t eat all the mud around the well in front of everyone like this!</p>
 <p>By doing so, he would never be able to show his face again in the world. Moreover, this would be a detriment to his master and sect’s prestige as well.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily quipped: “Oh? All talk but no action?”</p>
 <p>“You, you are very lucky to be able to draw some Void Imperfection Water… This is a miracle…” Yan Yanglong tried to find an excuse to avoid eating the muddy soil.</p>
 <p>“A real man stays true to his words, start swallowing the mud already!” Li Qiye looked coldly at the fella.</p>
 <p>The spectators were holding their breaths and didn’t want to get involved in these muddy waters.</p>
 <p>“Boy, don’t push it too far!” Yan Yanglong turned red and struggled with his retort: “You are deliberately humiliating my master and the Extreme Yang School!”</p>
 <p>At this time, he didn’t have any other plans and could only accuse Li Qiye to escalate the situation and bring up his master and school.</p>
 <p>“If your school has cowardly members that aren’t able to stay true to their word, am I the one that is humiliating your school?” Li Qiye wanted nothing more than to make this a bigger deal: “If your master’s guidance resulted in a coward like you, then it looks like he is not much either.”</p>
 <p>People took deep breaths after hearing this. It was an overbearing and suicidal move to put down the Extreme Yang Monarch in front of everyone like this.</p>
 <p>However, this was a way out for Yan Yanglong. At this moment, nothing else mattered since Li Qiye had publicly humiliated his master. This was a damning action!</p>
 <p>He angrily shouted with a solemn tone: “Little beast, shaming my master deserves a thousand deaths! You will not find mercy!”</p>
 <p>“Brother Yanglong, this naive fool dares to offend the Extreme Yang Monarch, this is akin to opposing the entire Extreme Yang School and all charming spirits. A little beast like this should be minced to pieces!” Dao Attendant Lin was happy to create more enemies for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>This was in accordance with Li Qiye’s wish, so their schemes were playing right into his hands. He smiled and pointed at the two to say: “These are the outstanding members of the Charming Spirit Race? To be considered outstanding at such a low level? Does the Charming Spirit Race have no shame, to have the nerve to call yourselves the favored children of the heavens? In my eyes, these trash aren’t even comparable to ants. As for this Extreme Yang Monarch or whatever Immaculate Expanse, they aren’t even shit in my eyes.”</p>
 <p>This blatant provocation made the two’s expressions turn red and ugly. For personal grievances, it was true they dragged their sects into this matter. However, Li Qiye’s public disparagement was too much for them to swallow.</p>
 <p>“Fool, you don’t know life from death!” A chilling shout came about at this time.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1208: Conveniently Dispatching The Enemies</b></p>
 <p>A youth descended from the sky with gushing blood energy and bright lights in an oppressive manner. The aggressive glint in his eyes shot everywhere as he exuded an unrestrained cocky attitude.</p>
 <p>There were many old men behind him with great blood energies. None of them were weak.</p>
 <p>“The Teeming Crown Prince is here.” One person shouted while others made way for the prince.</p>
 <p>This was the firstborn of the Teeming Tribemaster, its future leader. His fame was widespread across the five rivers and four seas. [1. A phrase meaning everywhere.]</p>
 <p>Dao Attendant Lin and Yan Yanglong were happy to see him as well. This was a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity. With his arrival, it would be difficult for Li Qiye to survive.</p>
 <p>The prince landed next to the divine well and loomed over Li Qiye to utter: “You are Li Qiye, right? How do you want to die?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and leisurely replied: “How do I want to die? I haven’t thought about that yet, but I sure know how you will die.”</p>
 <p>He laughed at the prince and continued: “If this was any other day, I would have torn your body apart to eat your dragon tendon, but I am not interested today. I shall only decapitate you so that your followers can take your head and tell your father that wherever I appear, your tribe should get as far as possible from me. Otherwise, come one and I’ll kill one, come two and I’ll kill two!”</p>
 <p>People gasped again after hearing this as their eyes darted to each other. These words were unbelievably arrogant. This was not just provoking the Teeming Tribe but a blatant declaration of war.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha. Come one, kill one, come two, kill two?” The crown prince burst out laughing and exclaimed: “With just you alone? Hahaha, even the entire human race is not qualified to be our enemy. It is not difficult for us to exterminate your lot! So be it, we will treat your race as food in the near future.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled and stepped towards the crown prince.</p>
 <p>One of the old men by the prince’s side shouted: “Arrogant junior, come and accept your death!”</p>
 <p>With a loud roar, these old men mounted their offense without showing any mercy. Bolts of lightning zipped towards Li Qiye. They were all experts, so this attack was much more powerful than the ones from the other Teeming Fish.</p>
 <p>This storm-like lightning offensive engulfed Li Qiye, wishing to burn him to a crisp.</p>
 <p>“Elders, we’ll lend you a hand!” In a split second, Yan Yanglong and Dao Attendant Lin exchanged glances and immediately took action. However, their target was not Li Qiye but rather Teng Jiwen and Ye Tu.</p>
 <p>Lin headed for Ye Tu while Yanglong aimed for Teng Jiwen. They claimed to be helping the Teeming Tribe, but in fact they had their own goals. Lin especially wanted the Void Imperfection Water from Ye Tu.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu’s expression greatly changed at the incoming attack from the dao attendant. Even though he was a supervisor of the Void Imperfection School, he didn’t have an advantage at all against Lin. Moreover, Lin cultivated the Void Imperfection Physique.</p>
 <p>He took out his treasures and channeled his laws. Multiple totems that resembled the shell of a Black Tortoise emerged to stop the dao attendant.</p>
 <p>However, a holy light rushed out of Lin’s body. This was his physique. The moment it came out, myriad laws would be unable to touch him as he soared through Ye Tu’s treasures and defensive laws. His hand went forth towards Ye Tu in order to capture him alive.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a flame covering thousands of miles around Yan Yanglong ignited to scorch Teng Jiwen. This was his Extreme Yang Physique.</p>
 <p>Teng Jiwen was much stronger than Yan Yanglong. He roared and took one step back to create a huge gap between the two. It was not difficult for him to kill Yanglong, he was only contemplating whether he wanted to antagonize the Extreme Yang School!</p>
 <p>Alas, Yanglong had no idea. He let out a battle cry and lunged forward like a dragon, sending a blazing inferno towards Teng Jiwen.</p>
 <p>“Suicidal fool!” In this moment, Li Qiye’s glare became severe. He didn’t care for the old men from the Teeming Tribe.</p>
 <p>With a boom, the Ancient Void Rune emerged. It didn’t matter how powerful the old men were, their lightning strike was instantly devoured by this rune; it wasn’t even enough for an appetizer.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye didn’t chase after the crown prince. He slightly moved his palm and a divine seal descended from the sky. It headed straight for Dao Attendant Lin.</p>
 <p>Lin was startled and channeled his physique to its limit. It was the same as a blooming lotus. He relied on this physique to avoid the suppressing seal.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Regardless of the level that his physique had reached, he couldn’t escape the seal. His entire body was pushed down by the seal with blood spurting everywhere.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye then flicked out a universal law. With a clang, this arrow-like law aimed straight for where Teng Jiwen and Yan Yanglong were.</p>
 <p>“Ahh—” Yanglong simply couldn’t dodge this law and was nailed to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Crackle!” In this split second, after the void rune had swallowed up the lightning currents, an even stronger one shot out. The dozen old men from the Teeming Tribe were blown away by the impact and fell to the ground. Smoke wafted from their bodies while others could smell burnt flesh. They were lying on the ground without moving; who knows if they were dead or alive.</p>
 <p>This all happened too fast. Some people didn’t even know what had just happened.</p>
 <p>The crown prince was shocked. He let out a long shout: “Little animal, die!”</p>
 <p>His lightning current turned into a saber that he swung horizontally. This slash turned into a huge lightning vortex that trapped Li Qiye within.</p>
 <p>The earth continuously quaked from the loud detonations within the lightning vortex. Many people were amazed by this power. The crown prince was able to materialize his current into a tangible form. No wonder why there had long been rumors about him setting one foot into the Virtuous Paragon realm. It seemed that this was true.</p>
 <p>People realized that even if he wasn’t a paragon, he was infinitely close to being one.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother taking a glimpse at the electric vortex and casually released a palm attack.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The lightning vortex shattered instantly. Meanwhile, this palm attack was still unceasing and struck the crown prince’s body.</p>
 <p>It was truly too fast, so others couldn’t see it clearly. The crown prince didn’t even have a chance to dodge.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” His body was stuck to the ground as his blood dyed the soil red.</p>
 <p>Everyone was dazed after seeing this. Someone couldn’t help but blurt out: “A Virtuous Paragon!”</p>
 <p>At this time, many realized that this human boy in front of them was a paragon, a true paragon. He was different from the crown prince who claimed to be one as the reality was that he had only set one foot into the door of this realm.</p>
 <p>Only a true paragon would be able to blow the crown prince away with just one slap.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, the scene turned very quiet as fear crept up among the crowd. They glanced at each other in disbelief. Since when did the human race have such a young paragon?</p>
 <p>In fact, regardless of the era, all who could reach this realm at such a young age would be geniuses. Even if they couldn’t deter the world, they would still enjoy great fame.</p>
 <p>However, no one had heard of the name Li Qiye before. Moreover, humans were too rare in the Heaven Spirit World; such a young paragon should have been famous long ago.</p>
 <p>All eyes were on him. Those with weaker cultivations felt their hearts jumping. They secretly praised their good fortune for not fighting with Li Qiye earlier. After all, they would only be fish on a chopping block before a Virtuous Paragon!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly turned around and walked towards the dao attendant suppressed by the divine seal. His body had completely shattered under the absolute suppression. He desperately tried to activate his Void Suppression Physique, but there was no response.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly stared him down and said: “I didn’t kill you earlier because I want you to die with clarity.”</p>
 <p>With a blanched complexion, the attendant harshly shouted: “My, my master is the supreme master of the Immaculate Expanse—”</p>
 <p>He couldn’t finish his sentence before Li Qiye completely smashed his skull with a stomp — off to hell with him. People’s hearts skipped a beat after hearing this bone-crushing noise. What a vexing and miserable way to go.</p>
 <p>He then walked past and looked at Yan Yanglong while smiling: “I have always been a merciful person. If you eat all the soil now, I can still spare your life.”</p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1209: Delivering The Skull As A Present</b></p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong couldn’t move even if he wanted to. While nailed to the ground by the law, he desperately struggled, but it was futile.</p>
 <p>He wanted to use his Extreme Yang Physique to burn this law, but regardless of how much power it emitted, it couldn’t burn this single law. The mud and soil around him had melted completely, but the law was untouched.</p>
 <p>He cried out in response: “Li, kill me if you dare, what’s the point of humiliating me! Even if I die, I still won’t eat the mud!” [1. He calls himself “young master” here instead of “me/I”. It is a powerful tone.]</p>
 <p>Yanglong was indeed unyielding. Even at death’s door, he didn’t beg at all and his words were still quite strong.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I’ll fulfill your wish.” Li Qiye leisurely smiled.</p>
 <p>Yan Yanglong madly howled: “Come on then! Kill me unless you’re a coward!” The refined flames of the sun engulfed his body like a volcanic eruption. No one could come close.</p>
 <p>He wanted to use his Extreme Yang Physique for protection. As long as Li Qiye was unable to break through it, he wouldn’t be able to kill him.</p>
 <p>Many people were surprised to see this. Yanglong was still quite powerful despite being nailed to the ground. This was indeed an Immortal Physique; other physiques couldn’t compare at all.</p>
 <p>How could Li Qiye not see through his thoughts? He smiled and said: “You’re displaying your slight skill before an expert. You think you can stay alive by using this little physique? Very well, I love to rip the hope out of people.”</p>
 <p>With that, he gently reached out with his palm. Even if Yanglong’s physique was more powerful, it wouldn’t be enough. The descending palm made the volcanic eruption of his physique seem like a candle flickering in the wind — bound to go out at any moment. The physique and refined sunflame instantly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Such a scene was truly astonishing. An immediate dispatch of an Immortal Physique — just how domineering and fierce was this style?</p>
 <p>“No!” Yanglong never expected that his physique wouldn’t be able to handle a single palm from Li Qiye. Unfortunately, it was too late for regret. He was annihilated just like his refined sunflame.</p>
 <p>Everyone felt their insides go cold amidst the serenity. They understood that this human boy ahead was completely vicious and unafraid of anyone. He dared to kill Daoist Lin’s attendant and the Extreme Yang Monarch’s disciple in front of everyone. This was enough to show his domineering nature; a person who didn’t care about antagonizing anyone!</p>
 <p>After killing Yan Yanglong, Li Qiye slowly walked to the front of the Teeming Prince. At this time, the prince’s body was completely fractured like broken porcelain. Just the slightest touch would shatter his body.</p>
 <p>He was lying in a bloody pool and couldn’t move at all. Nevertheless, he was still quite fierce and looked at Li Qiye to coldly say: “The victor takes all. I can only blame myself for not having enough skill. Do as you will, the Teeming Tribe will have revenge for me by massacring your nine clans one day.”</p>
 <p>In the face of death, the prince’s nature was still as ferocious as ever, true to his race.</p>
 <p>“I will wait for your Teeming Tribe to come take revenge for you. The blood of billions shall stain this blue sea red.” Li Qiye smiled and swiftly chopped off the crown prince’s head.</p>
 <p>The prince’s eyes were still wide open as he glared at his enemy.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Li Qiye spread his palm and a lightning bolt shot out. The dozen dying old men were burnt to ashes with only one remaining.</p>
 <p>The moment this old man got up, Li Qiye threw him a box containing the prince’s head and smiled: “Bring this head back to the Teeming Tribemaster. Tell him and your entire race to not come and provoke me, or else he will share his son's fate. If I see any Teeming Fish daring to show up before me, I will kill them all.”</p>
 <p>The old man was trembling with anger, his face twisted with fury. Eventually, he spoke in a chill-inducing manner: “I will not leave out a single word!”</p>
 <p>With that, he left with the prince’s head.</p>
 <p>No one made any comments about Li Qiye’s message. The Teeming Tribe had always been a ruthless bunch and were quite aggressive and competitive recently. Li Qiye’s actions would enrage their entire tribe. The billions of their tribe would surely come to kill him no matter what!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye broke the silence by patting his palms together and told Teng Jiwen and Ye Tu: “Okay, let us go. There is nothing else to do here.”</p>
 <p>The duo quietly followed him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t get too far before turning back at the big shots hiding their true forms: “Return from whence you came. The Seacrossing Shuttle isn’t a place for you all to ponder. Even if your progenitor was here, he still wouldn’t dare to claim success.”</p>
 <p>These big shots didn’t refute Li Qiye’s statement.</p>
 <p>After leaving the fragmented realm and the shuttle, Li Qiye turned back to see the shuttle still floating away. He gently sighed at the Untethered Vessel and thought about the day that might come in the future.</p>
 <p>Ye Tu looked at it and asked: “When the Seacrossing Shuttle sinks back into the Bottomless Trench, will the Charming Fragmented Realm close again?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye answered with a nod: “Yes. Its next appearance will be very long from now. Or rather, this world will have changed by then.”</p>
 <p>The group returned to Shallow Beach where a Void Imperfection disciple was already waiting. Ye Tu received the news and immediately told Li Qiye with excitement: “Young Noble, the school has sent a message, the ancestral whale is waiting for you.”</p>
 <p>“Good, I’ll set off at once.” He patted Ye Tu’s and Teng Jiwen’s shoulders and smiled: “It is time for me to go now. Do a good job training, maybe we'll meet again one day.”</p>
 <p>The two bowed to say goodbye. This short period of time with Li Qiye had granted them great benefits that would last them a lifetime.</p>
 <p>The Jade Sea was unimaginably vast, almost boundless. Its depths were beyond speculation with countless living beings thriving within. Some of them were wondrous creatures.</p>
 <p>Very few cultivators and tribes were here at the desolate edge of this sea because it was simply too far from the central area. Mountains were in abundance at the bottom of the sea. One couldn’t see an end to them.</p>
 <p>The number of islands could be compared to the number of stars in the sky. However, they were all uninhabited.</p>
 <p>This was where the ancestral whale of the Void Imperfection School was sleeping. Of course, this was only a temporary rest. When it woke up again, it would swim everywhere throughout the Jade, Abyss, and Dragon Demon Seas!</p>
 <p>In the legends, it was a gigantic whale left behind by Immortal Emperor Wu Gou. It had the bloodline of a true dragon, but it had yet to gain intelligence so it still had its whale form.</p>
 <p>In a certain sense, this whale was the ancestral ground of the Void Imperfection Three Schools, a mobile one!</p>
 <p>A great deal of resources was contained in this whale. Both treasures and merit laws were divided and some were kept inside the beast.</p>
 <p>If one day the three schools were to meet a formidable enemy and be completely destroyed, as long as the ancestral whale was still there, there was a chance to rise again. Unless this enemy was able to destroy the ancestral whale as well, the spark of the three schools would continue to be passed down for generations.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t an easy matter to destroy an existence like the ancestral whale. An Immortal Emperor going all out might be able to do so, but even Godkings were not sufficient for this task.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the location of the whale had always been a secret. Very few within the sects knew its true whereabouts.</p>
 <p>Its cruising trajectory through the vast seas was impossible to predict. And after a long journey, it would swim to the depths of the sea to hibernate out of sight.</p>
 <p>An old man was waiting for Li Qiye the moment he entered this region. The old man had a full beard and white hair, making him look like an old mortal around the age of seventy. No one knew how long he had lived for.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, his blood energy was still robust. This was a terrifying Godking.</p>
 <p>“You must be Young Noble Li.” The old man cupped his fists and smiled at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled back and nodded: “Following the ancestral whale has been very rewarding for you. It looks like you have lived for two generations now.”</p>
 <p>The old man was frightened to hear this. His identity had always been a secret, even to his own sect. His mind shuddered at the sudden revelation of his longevity.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1210: Ancestral Whale</b></p>
 <p>The old man took a deep breath and said: “Young Noble, your vision is wonderful. I am full of admiration, please come inside.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded and stepped into the sea. In the blink of an eye, they sank to the deepest region of the seabed before stopping in front of a mountain.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” A burst of collapsing rubble resounded. The mountain not far from Li Qiye shattered into pieces. Boulders fell down, causing the fish nearby to flee in horror.</p>
 <p>When this mountain shattered completely, it suddenly became bright. A ray of light illuminated the bottom of the sea. Before them was a magnificent world, mysterious and sparkling. It resembled a portal leading to a whole new world.</p>
 <p>Upon a closer inspection, one would see that this was no portal at all. It was an unbelievably large eye. This eye was previously covered by the mountains.</p>
 <p>When this eye opened completely, its light completely engulfed Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The earth began to quake as if the entire sea was about to be overturned. Tidal waves rose to the vault of the sky as if something was awakening, something capable of destroying the stars up in the nine heavens.</p>
 <p>More mountains began to collapse in this area. The islands on the surface crumbled as well and sank to the bottom.</p>
 <p>“How can this be?” The old man was shocked and exclaimed: “Why, why is the ancestral whale waking up before the appointed time?”</p>
 <p>“Boom!” A tsunami of limitless height assaulted the sky, resulting in a spectacular scene. A monstrous whale emerged from the sea. This region’s geography was changed completely.</p>
 <p>This whale was no different than a continent appearing at sea level. There was no end to this whale as far as the eyes could see. It was as long as a mountain range floating above the sea.</p>
 <p>This was the ancestral whale of the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Very few people in this world had seen it before. Despite rumors of having a true dragon bloodline, its lacking intelligence prevented it from turning into a true dragon for now.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood above its gigantic head at this time. It was no different from an island that spanned thousands of miles.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye patted its head and spoke with emotions: “In the northern darkness, there is a fish and his name is K'un. The K'un is so huge, who knows how many million li he measures…” [1. A longer passage of this is found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)">here.</a>]</p>
 <p>“Oooooo!” The whale roared after hearing Li Qiye. It was a heaven-shattering cry. The soul and the sky both quaked before its reverberations.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” A huge water pillar shot straight to the sky from its head. It seemed to be particularly excited.</p>
 <p>“This, this is a true whale rider!” The old man was dumbfounded while blurting these words.</p>
 <p>He stared at Li Qiye in disbelief. Not even in his dreams would he expect Li Qiye to become a whale rider upon first meeting with the whale — this was too unbelievable.</p>
 <p>“Is this predetermined by the heavens? Is it granting us the destined prince that will lead the three schools to new heights of greatness?” The old man dazedly murmured to himself.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t be blamed for being so shocked. Although those like him who were stationed near the whale for a prolonged period were called whale riders, they were not real whale riders. To be more accurate, they were whale trackers.</p>
 <p>This was because true whale riders could control the ancestral whale. As for them, they didn’t have this ability. The ancestral whale was much stronger than them, so unless they were to be recognized by the whale as its masters, they wouldn’t be able to become whale riders. Only those who were recognized could be called true whale riders.</p>
 <p>A few old men like him could only follow the whale throughout its journey. They simply had no way of changing the route and destination of the whale.</p>
 <p>After a long while, the old man’s mind returned. He emotionally kneeled on the ground and couldn’t conceal his excitement: “The heavens have eyes, it has bestowed a destined king to us. You are the whale rider of our Void Imperfection Three Schools, we will have a chance to unite again.”</p>
 <p>“The heavens have eyes?” Li Qiye burst out into laughter and shook his head: “The old villainous heavens will never open his dog eyes, let alone give a destined king to your three schools.”</p>
 <p>“In any case, Young Noble, you are our whale rider, a blessing for our school.” The old man was still excited all the same.</p>
 <p>“Whale rider or not, I will be fetching the water from the Void Imperfection Spring.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his sleeve.</p>
 <p>“Ooooo—” The ancestral whale cried out after hearing this.</p>
 <p>With a buzz, a portal that led into the whale’s body opened.</p>
 <p>The ecstatic old man said: “Young Noble, please enter!”</p>
 <p>With a smile, Li Qiye entered the portal and was teleported into the whale with the old man right behind him.</p>
 <p>It was an incredible scene. Palaces were built among the mountains.</p>
 <p>Who could imagine that there were mountains within a whale? This was an entirely separate world with majestic peaks and flowing waterfalls. Those who knew that this was the inside of a whale would find the whole thing inconceivable.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye and the old man entered a palace with an even larger dimension within. There was nothing in this palace hall outside of a large lake.</p>
 <p>The water in this lake was calm. Due to its serene nature, those who were present would feel like they were floating. The water washed away the seven emotions and six desires. Their body would be covered with an immortal energy. Next, divine rings would emerge around them. They would gain the feeling of wanting to abandon the mortal flesh as they could ascend to an immortal at any moment.</p>
 <p>“There are no other places with as much Void Imperfection Water as your three schools.” Li Qiye looked at the lake and insipidly said: “Back then, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou left behind plenty of resources for you all. Otherwise, your three schools wouldn’t have two more grand completion Immortal Physiques and two complete laws.”</p>
 <p>“Our achievements today were granted by the great forefathers.” The old man agreed. Li Qiye was simply stating the truth.</p>
 <p>They had sufficient resources. As long as there were talented enough disciples with strong willpower, their schools could groom them into excellent beings.</p>
 <p>The talented prospects had a chance to enter the Void Imperfection Spring in order to change their constitution. After this process, their cultivation would soar like a tiger with wings.</p>
 <p>Thus, the three schools only lacked talents while having no shortage of resources.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took out a gourd and began to absorb a large amount of Void Imperfection Water. For the three schools, this water was extremely precious. Not to mention the disciples, even the ancestors couldn’t easily take it out of the ancestral whale outside of special circumstances.</p>
 <p>However, the old man had no objections to Li Qiye’s actions because Li Qiye could bring down the Void Imperfection Clouds. According to their ancestral teachings, Li Qiye was qualified to take the water here. Moreover, he was also a whale rider, thus he had the great authority to take as much as he wanted. It was not a big deal.</p>
 <p>After taking enough, Li Qiye turned and left. However, the moment he exited the palace, several old men could be found kneeling on the ground with great reverence. They normally stayed inside the ancestral whale for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Li Qiye glanced at them and flatly said: “I am not your whale rider, get up.”</p>
 <p>One of them hurriedly said: “Young Noble, please stay. Our three schools require your leadership. As long as you are there, we will return to one again.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and gently shook his head: “I already said I am not a whale rider, I’m only a fleeting passenger. There’s no need to care or pay attention to me.”</p>
 <p>“But the ancestral whale has chosen you as its rider.” This old man answered with haste: “Maybe Young Noble is unaware of the significance of being a whale rider. For millions of years, the countless wise sages from our schools all desired to become one…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “I know what it means to be one. When your progenitor and the two grand completion physique users are not in this world, the whale rider represents the highest authority in the three schools! This person can reunite the three schools into one again!”</p>
 <p>The old man elaborated: “Young Noble, you are completely correct. As long as you stay, all of the disciples will listen to your commands, all of our resources will be for you to use…”</p>
 <p>“I understand.” Li Qiye was without any interest: “For many people, to become a whale rider is the highest of honors, the greatest symbol of authority, the thing that many wise sages from your schools have been longing for.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1211: Beginning Of The Grand Scheme</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye paused a bit to stare at the old man ahead while voicing his refusal: “All of this has nothing to do with me. As a passerby, I am insignificant to your three schools.”</p>
 <p>The old man repeated: “But Young Noble, you have been chosen by the ancestral whale. Since the start of time, few have been chosen by it. This must be the imperial decree of our progenitor, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye interrupted him: “Okay, I have a deeper understanding of this matter than you lot, there’s no need to use the emperor as justification. Just remember what I have said, I cannot bring anything to your schools, so don’t rely on me.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he turned and left. These old men felt helpless and only followed Li Qiye to see him off.</p>
 <p>After leaving the ancestral whale’s body, Li Qiye stood on the sea's surface to look at its gigantic size. He sighed gently and touched it while murmuring: “We’ll meet again if it is meant to be.”</p>
 <p>“Woooo—” The whale cried out and gently moved its huge head ever so slightly forward against Li Qiye’s palm.</p>
 <p>The old men were in disbelief after seeing how intimate the pair was. Outside of Immortal Emperor Wu Gou, no one else had been this close to the whale.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye patted the whale’s head. He gave this whale to Immortal Emperor Wu Gou when it was still an infant. Later on, it always accompanied the emperor.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Li Qiye looked at the old men and said: “Even if you see a friend off for a thousand miles, you will still have to part in the end. Go back now, the ancestral whale will start moving again.”</p>
 <p>An old man still didn’t give up and told Li Qiye: “Young Noble, you can reconsider later. If you do return to our schools in the future, all of our echelons will obey your commands.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and reached out with his palm. A portal opened and he vanished inside.</p>
 <p>He went back to Peacock Land and saw Kong Qinru. She busily asked after seeing him again: “Young Noble, the preparations have been carried out. The inhabitants here have been evacuated, may I ask when you will start?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and slowly uttered: “Very soon. Everything is ready, we are only waiting for the east wind.” [1. Zhuge Liang, battle of Chi Bi/Red Cliffs.]</p>
 <p>She asked: “What is the east wind you are referring to?”</p>
 <p>“Life — only something as precious as this will be able to replenish the tree.” Li Qiye replied dismissively: “It will come very soon.”</p>
 <p>Kong Qinru was startled after hearing this. She thought about a very terrifying matter and turned pale. She gasped and asked: “This, is this right?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily glanced at her and replied: “Little woman, do you think there is such a thing as a free lunch in this world? There is no harvest without a price! Life replenishment is a heaven-defying task, this is going against the villainous heavens, so do you think we can accomplish this quickly?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye closed his eyes at this point then continued: “If you want to prolong the tree’s life, you must be mentally prepared. Without this awareness, there won’t be any need to talk about life replenishment or working for the well-being of the human race.”</p>
 <p>She hesitated a bit and asked: “Will, will this violate the harmony of the heavens?”</p>
 <p>“Harmony of the heavens?” Li Qiye sneered: “What is this harmony? It definitely doesn’t exist in the eyes of the villainous heavens. Plus, since when did cultivators not violate this harmony? Fighting and competing against the heavens, resisting the Heaven’s Will! The path of cultivation itself is violating the harmony of this world, it is a path of rebellion.”</p>
 <p>With that, Li Qiye told her: “There’s no need to worry about this violation. Instead, you should ask your conscience and morality to see if you can get over it. Only by surpassing this dao ridge will you be able to sleep well at night.”</p>
 <p>He continued by pointing at his heart: “This is the most important thing for cultivators, the thing that allows them to go to the very end! As for the villainous heavens, he is but a wretch! People can be killed, but their conscience will live on! Not even the villainous heavens can do anything about it!”</p>
 <p>Kong Qinru quietly thought for a moment. She could imagine the scene of hell, a terrible catastrophe that was about to come.</p>
 <p>“It is not too late to change your mind, it will be one less thing for me to do.” Li Qiye smiled freely and added: “The plans have been set in motion, whether we carry them out or not is up to your will.”</p>
 <p>Eventually, she took a deep breath and solemnly spoke: “Since we have made it this far, there is no reason to retreat! For the human race, I am willing to bear all the infamy.”</p>
 <p>“Leave that to me.” Li Qiye said: “If others know about it, a disaster will come to your Exquisite Valley.”</p>
 <p>“But…” Kong Qinru looked at him in response: “This was my idea. If you have to bear the infamy, I’m afraid you won’t ever be able to wash it off.”</p>
 <p>“Having a bad reputation is nothing. Don’t worry, even though I am a vicious and ruthless man, I know better than you on who deserves to die and who doesn’t.”</p>
 <p>She emotionally replied: “Young Noble, you are working for the human race while shouldering the infamy. You are the savior of our race.”</p>
 <p>“Savior?” Li Qiye smiled and looked at the far horizon. For millions of years, he had gained plenty of titles. Of course, there were those who praised him as the guardian of the human race, but more often than not they cursed him as a criminal, the evil hand behind the curtains, a murderous devil king… He had grown used to them and no longer cared about their condemnation.</p>
 <p>He said: “Let’s go, it is almost showtime. I have to leave when this is done.”</p>
 <p>She gently nodded before speaking: “There is more news about the person you are looking for. She has left the Jade Sea for the Dragon Demon Sea, headed for a particular lineage. I heard this lineage has deep ties with the Undying Gate, some believe it is an offshoot.”</p>
 <p>“Undying Gate.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed with a glint.</p>
 <p>She elaborated: “However, the Undying Gate has been in decline for a long time. The branch in question is almost completely gone. Even if there are disciples left, I’m afraid there won’t be many of them.”</p>
 <p>He replied: “I know, their end was determined the moment Immortal Emperor Bu Si collapsed.”</p>
 <p>The Undying Gate was a lineage established by Immortal Emperor Bu Si. There were plenty of legends about this sect. Many generations of wise men believed that the Undying Gate still had the art of immortality from Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Because of this, people continuously searched for its secrets.</p>
 <p>No matter who they may be, people wished for the day they could obtain everlasting life. Unfortunately, everyone knew that it was impossible. However, legends of Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s art of immortality had existed since ancient times. These arts allowed him to revive time and time again. Thus, everyone wanted this art that would allow them to have a second life.</p>
 <p>But as time passed, how many had seen this art or knew why the emperor was unkillable?</p>
 <p>After a few days, several strange visual phenomena emerged at Peacock Land. At first, a bloody light soared to the sky in a boundless manner like an inexhaustible flood. The entire place trembled with earthquakes. Next, it began to crack, forming a great chasm as if the entire land was about to crumble.</p>
 <p>Cultivators and sects from the outside were attracted by the frequent changes of this land. A piece of news quickly spread across the entire Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>“The Peacock Tree is about to wither and die.” No one knows who began to gossip first, but it traveled very quickly across the Jade Sea.</p>
 <p>The sea was in a clamor. Many cultivators and sects discussed this matter.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World and all that inhabit it, an existence like an ancestral tree dying was an earth-shattering event.</p>
 <p>A big sect didn’t believe this news. They immediately sent disciples to Peacock Land to seek confirmation. After seeing these visual images, the disciple went back to report right away.</p>
 <p>After confirming the information, the sect master of this sect murmured: “It looks like the Peacock Tree is truly dying.”</p>
 <p>An elder said: “With a quick finger augur, the Peacock Tree’s lifespan should end right about now. The treefather has returned to the earth for too long, the time is about right.”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this too fast though? The death of the Peacock Tree is inevitable, but this collapse is too sudden. What happened to accelerate this withering process?” A different big shot was curious and decided to go see for himself.</p>
 <p>Some were saddened by this news, but even more were excited. For many people and sects, a dying ancestral tree meant a great feast was coming. Anyone would want a bowl of soup from this great feast!</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1212: The Prelude Before The Storm</b></p>
 <p>The withering of the tree meant that it was about to return everything to the earth. Many treasures would be thrown out along with a huge amount of worldly essence.</p>
 <p>It was certainly a feast for any cultivator or sect. If they could obtain a great treasure during this frenzy, it would bring about a lifetime of benefits. They might even become wealthy overnight due to the great reversal of fortune. From then, they would embark on a road towards invincibility.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t like such a thing had never happened before. In the past, some people had obtained the main roots of a dying treefather, allowing them to cultivate at a quicker pace and eventually become a Godking.</p>
 <p>The entire Heaven Spirit World was excited as many people ran for Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>“This death is coming too fast, I thought the tree would last for one or two more generations!” A real master from the previous generation heard this news and was surprised. He felt fairly hesitant.</p>
 <p>Most were unable to sit still, but some experienced big shots were more cautious. They could speculate that even though the tree was withering, it could still struggle on for dozens of years or even a full century with its power.</p>
 <p>As long as the tree was still alive, who would dare to scheme for the treasures and worldly essence? No one wanted to fight an ancestral tree, even if it was dying. However, some of them still became impatient.</p>
 <p>After several more days, one more piece of news came from the Jade Sea. It stated: “Peacock Land is shattering. The Peacock Tree is bound to die in half a month if early or half a year if late!”</p>
 <p>With this, these older cultivators could wait no longer despite their skepticism. They were unwilling to miss this feast, and so began to travel towards Peacock Land to verify this news.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, people rushed to this land to see if they could get a share. There were many charming spirits, treants, and sea demons, so it became quite lively. The lineages closest to Peacock Land had an advantage, they were there already by the time others arrived.</p>
 <p>The inhabitants of Peacock Land were long gone. The land was deserted and lonely until all of these cultivators came along.</p>
 <p>All sorts of cultivators showed up, ranging from treants covered in leaves and crab demons with a human head to beautiful and handsome charming spirits. Occasionally, one could see one or two human cultivators.</p>
 <p>All the races were excited about the upcoming harvest, only the human race was mourning.</p>
 <p>The Peacock Tree held a sentimental spot in the minds of many humans since it had done a lot for them. It was the second land of the humans, their home.</p>
 <p>The withering of the tree meant that this land would cease to exist and shatter into little pieces. Thereafter, the human race would lose a stronghold and haven in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>Even though some humans wanted to do something for the tree, even their top-level experts were powerless.</p>
 <p>Its lifespan had run out, so this was an irreversible situation. The only cure was life replenishment.</p>
 <p>However, this was simply impossible. Even top experts couldn’t do it for this was a task tantamount to life replenishing an Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>The cultivators rushing here found many cracks on this massive land. Seawater was gushing through the cracks and a lot of the vegetation on the continent had begun to wither as well.</p>
 <p>The quaking was becoming more common, as if this place was about to crumble at any second.</p>
 <p>“It looks like the Peacock Tree can’t hold on any longer, this land is falling apart. It won’t be long now. Even if it won’t turn to ashes, it will fragment into little pieces.” A big shot from the previous generation was not quite convinced in the beginning, but he changed his mind after coming here.</p>
 <p>“The residents here probably knew that the tree was about to die so they evacuated first.” An expert wasn’t surprised to see the place empty either.</p>
 <p>Some human cultivators came running onto the land in search for their kin to see if there were still families stranded on the island. This disaster was a time for the human race to unite. As long as there were still people that had yet to evacuate, regardless of whether they were mortals or cultivators, other humans would lend them a hand. In this dire strait, the humans had to rely on each other.</p>
 <p>The Exquisite Valley did a great job of evacuating everyone. The human cultivators searched all corners of the land but didn’t find any people stranded. These helpers heaved a sigh of relief after discovering this.</p>
 <p>The situation became more pessimistic as the days passed. Today, the earthquakes were extremely frequent, resulting in even more cracks and the invasion of seawater into the crevices of the land.</p>
 <p>“Fall back, we’ll watch from outside.” A lineage who wanted a piece of this feast ordered their disciples to retreat. They went out to sea and began to play the waiting game.</p>
 <p>The imminent destruction of the land made many sects leave this place. They waited for the death of the Peacock Tree right outside as well.</p>
 <p>Experienced characters knew that when the Peacock Tree dies, this land would be crushed or even turn into smoke. At that time, the destructive force would be incredible.</p>
 <p>An ancestral tree was an existence comparable to an Immortal Emperor. Just imagine the destructive power that would result from the collapse of an Immortal Emperor. If anyone dared to stay behind, they would be crushed in their final moment, getting nothing out of it.</p>
 <p>The outer sea right now was stationed full of cultivators. Some big sects and ancient schools were keeping guard with different methods. One of the powerful sects used a great ship to float at sea and occupy the most advantageous position.</p>
 <p>Another treant tribe took root in the seabed and had a huge towering tree growing from it. It twisted and turned into a favorable position for seizing the treasures. The moment the ancestral tree died, they would flip the earth over to seize the most valuable resources.</p>
 <p>Some sea clans came in droves as well. They stayed in the vast sea and were ready to take whatever edge they could see…</p>
 <p>Moreover, people from outside of the Jade Sea were gathering as well. The death of an ancestral tree was a great event, so even sects from farther regions sent disciples over.</p>
 <p>As for the human cultivators, they stayed in this area with great confusion. Were they here to look at Peacock Land one last time? Was it to seize the treasures as well? Or could it be to say their final farewell to the Peacock Tree…</p>
 <p>While many cultivators gathered in this region, a young lad appeared out of nowhere. This human youth looked quite plain. Even his blood energy was feeble, so he definitely didn’t resemble an expert.</p>
 <p>He drew a large circle that covered the marine regions outside with the center being Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>The majority of the sects were within the boundary of this circle; only a few cultivators were outside.</p>
 <p>Many people found this young human cultivator’s actions quite strange. They didn’t know what this brat was trying to do.</p>
 <p>At this time, he took out a sign and wrote a few words: “Danger zone, do not enter or die.”</p>
 <p>He put these signs everywhere, causing the cultivators waiting in this area to look at each other.</p>
 <p>They didn’t know what he was trying to do. Was this a nice reminder or a warning to everyone?</p>
 <p>Another human cultivator couldn’t help but ask: “Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Of course, this youth was Li Qiye. He was particularly patient and approachable at this time; he replied with a friendly smile: “I am reminding everyone about how dangerous this place is. Countless existences will die, so for everyone’s safety, it is best to stand outside of the circle.”</p>
 <p>His bashful smile was a bit unbearable. Those who knew Li Qiye would definitely not believe their eyes after seeing him smiling like this.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1213: Ophidian Treant </b></p>
 <p>Some cultivators nearby exchanged glances. They didn’t know if this human boy before them had never seen the world before or if he was just simple by nature.</p>
 <p>In the world of cultivation, the law of the jungle reigned supreme. Who would care about the well-being of others, let alone kindly remind them about dangers?</p>
 <p>A cultivator laughed and said: “Danger? Boy, is this your first time leaving the house? Since when is being a cultivator not dangerous?”</p>
 <p>The others laughed as well, feeling that this kid was quite naive and didn’t know the situation. Everyone was here for the treasures and worldly essences, and they knew full well the dangers that this entailed.</p>
 <p>“I’m still responsible for reminding everyone.” Li Qiye smiled bashfully: “My suggestion is for everyone to stand outside of the circle. After all, this is a troubled land, so something ominous is definitely coming. Standing inside will end in certain demise.”</p>
 <p>A cultivator turned black and coldly spoke: “Ignorant child, what are you talking about? We are here for the treasure hunt, how can this be ominous?”</p>
 <p>Knowing the danger was one thing, but no one liked to hear about it.</p>
 <p>They were here for an undeserved fortune, but it hadn’t even come out yet before Li Qiye issued such an ill omen. Of course some cultivators wouldn’t be happy to hear this.</p>
 <p>“It will be very ominous.” Li Qiye earnestly said: “In my opinion, blood will run like rivers, staining the Jade Sea red. Millions of corpses will fill up this region and countless beings will suffer miserable deaths. Today is the day that the entire Heaven Spirit World trembles. This is why I’m reminding everyone here.”</p>
 <p>His serious attitude made the people here change their expressions. These words were too unlucky, making them all glare at him.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye looked just like a dolt. With a very serious and earnest expression, he looked at everyone and said: “I advise everyone to stand outside of the circle. A tragic death here is not worth it.”</p>
 <p>Some felt like vomiting blood from anger after listening to this kid. The treasures had yet to come out, but they were stuck here listening to this dolt speak such ominous words.</p>
 <p>A middle-aged man coldly spat: “What nonsense!” He was tall and burly with a golden cloak. His squinting eyes shot out a fearsome glint.</p>
 <p>There were many disciples behind him. They looked to be quite skilled, so it was apparent that they came from a great sect.</p>
 <p>This man was the deputy sectmaster of the Dual-Pupils Sect, a decently powerful faction in this area. He brought his fellow disciples along for the treasure hunt and was not happy to hear Li Qiye’s unlucky words.</p>
 <p>“It’s not nonsense.” Li Qiye looked at this deputy master and said: “With your power, I’m afraid when the disaster arrives, you won’t last for even a minute before turning into ashes.”</p>
 <p>Such words made this deputy master grimace. As a deputy master, both his fame and reputation were not to be underestimated. Although he was not as great as the paragons, he was still a talented strategist worthy of respect.</p>
 <p>Being looked down on by a human boy like this was truly an affront to his prestige.</p>
 <p>“Pa!” The Dual-Pupils Deputy Master furiously unleashed a palm strike and shattered the sign that Li Qiye had just put up. He coldly spoke: “I’m waiting for this so-called disaster then!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly stared back in response: “It will come and your shrill screams will echo through this world. At that time, neither the heavens nor the earth will answer your cry for help.”</p>
 <p>This master trembled with anger and had a twisted expression.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators here were silent. They didn’t know if this boy ahead was really slow or just acting the fool. He actually went against the deputy master from the Dual-Pupils Sect and gave him no room to step down from this argument.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, where did this human boy come from to be making such alarmist claims?” One of the people present sneered: “He probably has some ulterior motives, such as trying to frighten others away so the humans can monopolize the treasures.”</p>
 <p>It was an old man that looked like a snake coiled around a small tree. In fact, the snake body and tree branch were inseparable. Only his head was in human form.</p>
 <p>This was an Ophidian Treant, a branch from the Treant Race. However, this man maintained his original form and didn’t cultivate a complete human form.</p>
 <p>He was an elder of his tribe. At this time, he had a dark smile on his face and believed that Li Qiye was scheming.</p>
 <p>Many people were a bit startled and felt that this was logical. Otherwise, why would a human be so nice as to remind them like this? He surely had ulterior motives.</p>
 <p>Very briefly, their eyes fell upon Li Qiye with a different light.</p>
 <p>“So he is just here to scare everyone.” The deputy leader snorted and shouted: “Speak! Who sent you here?! Tell the truth to avoid pain.”</p>
 <p>“Kindness is treated as malice. If you want to die so much, it is your own business.” Li Qiye gave him an indifferent glance and said: “I have warned everyone to stand outside the circle to the best of my ability. Life or death will now depend on your own fortune.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
 <p>“Junior, stop right now!” The deputy leader screamed and reached out to grab Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye’s body flashed and easily evaded his clutch before turning around to face him.</p>
 <p>“Heh, looks like you have some moves.” The deputy leader sneered: “State your name, I will not kill a nobody. Quickly reveal who is giving you orders or suffer!”</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye lazily said: “Scram before I become angry.”</p>
 <p>Many people were unfamiliar with this name, but some had heard it before. A cultivator from the Jade Sea said: “He is that Li Qiye, the fierce youth who dares to eat dragon tendons in public.”</p>
 <p>A few who had heard of his name found it quite surprising while stealing glances at him. They didn’t expect for this seemingly ordinary human to be the monster who ate dragon tendons. They all assumed that he would look like a vicious and domineering brute.</p>
 <p>After all, eating dragon tendons was something that would provoke billions of Teeming Fish. Only an overbearing monster would be able to do something like this. Alas, the Li Qiye in front of them bore no semblance of this preconceived image.</p>
 <p>“You are that Li Qiye!” The deputy master became hesitant. He had heard of Li Qiye’s notoriety. Someone who dared to publicly eat tendons was certainly not ordinary and nice.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly stated: “Now that you know, do not provoke me.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, such confidence. This isn’t a place a human brat like you can give orders.” The elder from the Ophidian Tribe wanted to fan the flames.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, the deputy master arched his chest and coldly said: “The elder is right. This place belongs to everyone. What makes you think you can act presumptuously and make other people stand outside of the circle? What is your true goal?!”</p>
 <p>At the very least, he was still a deputy master. If he couldn’t utter a few strong words, he would be in an awkward situation bereft of any face. Even his sect would lose some reputation.</p>
 <p>“Scram right now or I’ll kill you before the disaster even gets here!” Li Qiye was losing his patience.</p>
 <p>Glances were exchanged in the crowd after hearing this. They finally felt that this normal human was incredibly fierce and domineering, he actually dared to scold the leader of a sect like this.</p>
 <p>The deputy leader lost a lot of face from being scolded by a junior. How could he swallow this anger?</p>
 <p>“Boy, today, I will flay you alive!” He took out his saber and threatened with a chilling gaze.</p>
 <p>With that, his saber slashed through the sky at an extreme speed straight for Li Qiye’s chest. He wanted to kill him with a single blow.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye raised his brows while a cold glint flashed across his eyes. He formed a fist and launched it at the oncoming blade.</p>
 <p>With a buzz, boundless brilliance surged forth. A huge amount of refined sunfire gushed out, as if nine suns were rising from his fist. The moment these suns came out, they instantly incinerated everything.</p>
 <p>In a split second, the deputy master’s saber was melted into molten metal. He screamed right before he was turned into smoke. Not even his bones were left behind.</p>
 <p>Though he was not weak, one who had yet to become a paragon was no different from an ant before Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Extreme Yang Fist of the Myriad Dao Fists — the moment it came out, it would scorch the nine heavens and ten earths, let alone a mere deputy master.</p>

 <p>The air stopping blowing and the spectators stopped moving. No one thought that just one move would render the deputy leader of the Dual-Pupils Sect to smithereens.</p>
 <p>Some couldn’t help but take a deep breath, realizing that this seemingly ordinary boy was incredibly fierce.</p>
 <p>“Truly someone who dares to eat dragon tendons.” Some female cultivators looked at Li Qiye with some admiration: “A real man has to be this fierce.”</p>
 <p>The demeanors of the onlookers changed while looking at him. They now understood that this kid was not only a murderer, but also an ominous star. He would provoke a bunch of enemies wherever he goes. Teeming Fish, the Immaculate Expanse, and the Extreme Yang School on top of the Dual-Pupils Sect… none were left unoffended!</p>
 <p>If he kept on killing regardless of the location like this and made enemies everywhere, his death would only be a matter of time.</p>
 <p>“What a ruthless human.” The Ophidian elder revealed a dark smile: “Do you want to kill everyone here to take all the treasures for yourself? Your plot will not go as planned, the heroes of this world are still flocking to this place…”</p>
 <p>“Pop!” A crisp slapping sound came about. Before the elder could finish, Li Qiye had mercilessly slapped him with enough force to deform his skull. The fangs in his mouth were blown out as well.</p>
 <p>This elder only wanted to escalate the situation to get everyone involved in this feud with Li Qiye. He didn’t expect that Li Qiye would slap all the teeth out of him so quickly.</p>
 <p>“Little animal!” He was furious and cried out before spewing a billow of poisonous smoke. This terrifying smoke engulfed Li Qiye like a tornado, attempting to melt him down completely.</p>
 <p>This smoke was extremely poisonous. A few drops that fell down turned the seawater into a white liquid. Many aquatic creatures were instantly killed by the poison.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye simply didn’t care for this smoke. He reached out with his hand again, a hand akin to a blossoming lotus capable of purifying all corruption.</p>
 <p>Void Imperfection Fist — the moment this fist came out, myriad laws would retreat and everything would be purified.</p>
 <p>The smoke was not enough to reach the apex before this fist. With a sizzling sound, it pierced through the poisonous smoke, straight towards the elder.</p>
 <p>The elder was stunned and turned to flee. However, even if he was faster, he wouldn’t be as swift as Li Qiye’s Soaring Immortal Fist. Li Qiye’s hand immediately caught the fleeing elder.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” A sharp and miserable cry resounded across the wide sea. With a tearing sound, the snake and the tree encompassing his body were torn apart. Blood spattered everywhere.</p>
 <p>For the Ophidian Tribe, the separation of the snake body and the tree trunk meant certain death. Thus, this elder twitched for a while before dying.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye casually threw his corpse down to the ground and coldly uttered: “Not even a Virtuous Paragon yet you still dare to prance around in front of me? You are but a mere insect.”</p>
 <p>Now, people’s expressions sank. This brat was truly too ruthless. This was no longer a rumor but reality.</p>
 <p>Even the characters from the previous generations were staring at Li Qiye in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the disciples from the Dual-Pupils Sect and declared: “Go back and tell your sect to take the long way around me or I’ll kill you all! Scram!”</p>
 <p>These stunned disciples were ecstatic to hear this; it was as if they had been granted amnesty by him. They immediately fled without any hesitation while showing their clean pair of heels. [1. Idiom meaning running so fast to the point where you lose your shoes.]</p>
 <p>After one final sweeping gaze through the crowd, Li Qiye entered Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>His entry to the land attracted a lot of attention. People were also curious as to why he came to this place.</p>
 <p>However, no one dared to provoke him after he made an example out of the deputy master and the Ophidian elder. They understood that this human boy was ruthless, having no qualms about murder. If one wasn’t a Virtuous Paragon, they simply wouldn’t be a match for him. Provoking him would be suicide.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye went straight to the peak and arrived before the Peacock Tree. He took out the Myriad Heavenly Cauldron and controlled its fire.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The cauldron’s fire gushed out like a spring and poured into the earth.</p>
 <p>Oddly enough, this fire flowing into the earth didn’t burn any plants or grasses. It was clearly a radiant flame, but it resembled flowing water. Moreover, it was becoming increasingly violent. It was a miracle that nothing was being hurt.</p>
 <p>“What a great fire manipulation technique!” Even those who weren’t alchemists recognized his mastery when nothing was being hurt by the streams of fire.</p>
 <p>The spraying fire came out faster and crazier like a huge river. In fact, it was not an exaggeration to call it a volcanic eruption.</p>
 <p>However, it didn’t carry the destructive force of a volcano. It actually brought about a cool feeling like spring water.</p>
 <p>This fire seemed to have its own life as it ran through the mountains, gullies and plains. In a short period of time, this huge amount of fire covered the entire Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>Next, it flowed into the sea and floated above the currents, as if it wanted to merge with the seawater.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, a change occurred in this fire. A different liquid carrying a spark came out from the cauldron with fine strings of laws. They seemed to have their own sentience as they flowed to the sea.</p>
 <p>Many people smelled a faint scent. It was difficult to explain this calming sensation that stemmed from the fragrance. The spectators waiting by the sea were fixated on Li Qiye. They were confused and didn’t know what he was trying to do.</p>
 <p>Eventually, someone couldn’t help but ask him from the distance: “Daoist Li, may I ask what you are doing?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was still controlling the cauldron as he answered nonchalantly: “Nothing much, just life replenishing the withering Peacock Tree so that it can stay alive since its lifespan is running out.”</p>
 <p>“Life replenishment for the Peacock Tree?” This cultivator’s eyes turned wide. He thought he had misheard and confirmed: “You are replenishing the Peacock Tree’s life?”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Li Qiye looked at him dismissively before he ignored him and continued to pour more fire into the earth and sea.</p>
 <p>The many people that heard this had to look at Li Qiye once more. Some even felt that they were looking at a fool.</p>
 <p>An alchemist spoke: “Even if you are an alchemist, do you know the meaning of life replenishing this ancestral tree? It is not only a heaven-defying feat, one can even say that it is simply impossible. The difficulty is no less than replenishing the life of an Immortal Emperor. Not to mention you, even an Alchemy Emperor would be powerless in this endeavor.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at him and was too lazy to reply. He continued on with his task.</p>
 <p>A sacred lord of the Charming Spirit Race sneered: “What a guy. This is the most ridiculous and outlandish thing I’ve ever seen.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was not interested in responding to this charming spirit either. Nevertheless, Li Qiye’s words startled the human cultivators quite a bit. They suddenly saw hope and asked: “Daoist, is this possible? Can you actually succeed?”</p>
 <p>The human race naturally didn’t want to see the Peacock Tree die as they would lose this land completely.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye plainly answered: “Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, people actually believe in this pretentious mess?” A sea demon snorted: “Only a fool would believe him. Everyone knows that for millions of years, no one has ever life replenished an ancestral tree. In my opinion, this so-called life replenishment is only a facade, he is secretly plotting something else.”</p>
 <p>What did all the other cultivators come here to do? Of course they came for the treasures. They were all waiting for the tree to die, so who would want to hear about Li Qiye trying to save it? Wasn’t this cutting off their path to riches? He had become public enemy number one.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Prolonging the life of an ancestral tree is a lunatic’s raving. He must be hiding his true purpose.” Quite a few members of the crowd echoed this sentiment with jeers.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1215: Golden Crow Monarch</b></p>
 <p>The human cultivators with newfound hope were shaken after hearing this. They also felt that this renewal was impossible. After all, no one had succeeded for millions of years.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at the few human cultivators and flatly said: “This is a troubled place with an incoming disaster. Blood will stain the land and bones will fill this ocean, so leave while you can. Return to your homes.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, the humans darted their eyes at each other with hesitation. One or two people left, but the rest remained.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was not too persuasive since he knew that they didn’t completely trust him.</p>
 <p>“Hehehe, just a human brat spouting nonsense. What a naive fool.” A gloomy voice sounded at this moment.</p>
 <p>The water splashed and separated to form a road on the sea. An old man emerged from the depths with more than ten ministers dressed in both scholarly and martial uniforms. Every single one of them was full of blood energy and looked quite extraordinary. [1. In ancient China, the imperial court was divided into martial officers and scholarly/literature officers.]</p>
 <p>The old man had a huge turtle shell on his back, showing that he was a demon turtle. His bean-sized eyes were flashing with glints. It was clear at first glance that this was definitely a vicious character.</p>
 <p>“The Turtle Minister.” Someone murmured after seeing this old man: “It looks like the Immaculate Expanse wants to get involved too.”</p>
 <p>The arrival of this old man and his followers made the waiting cultivators feel a great pressure. Prior to this, many great powers had shown up, but none were at the level of the expanse. If the expanse was now here, the other lineages like the Golden Isle and the Void Imperfection Three Schools might be on their way as well.</p>
 <p>Once they were here, it wouldn’t be as easy for the great powers to get a piece of the pie. As for the minor sects and vagrant cultivators, they would only be able to stand to the side as they were unqualified for this competition.</p>
 <p>The Turtle Minister was the prime minister of the Immaculate Expanse, a great military leader under Daoist Lin. He was a competent official and took care of the expanse’s administration for the daoist. Moreover, his own cultivation was great since he was a famous Virtuous Paragon.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily glanced at the turtle and said: “Just a turtle, stop blabbering or I’ll make turtle soup out of you.”</p>
 <p>The minister wasn’t happy to hear this. He was considered a great demon upon taking a form different from a turtle, so he absolutely despised others calling him a turtle.</p>
 <p>“Little animal, you killed my master’s attendant and dared to shame my Immaculate Expanse. Your crime is punishable by ten thousand deaths! I don’t care which sect you are from, you won’t be able to escape death today!” He pointed at Li Qiye and uttered: “If you want a quick death, kneel and surrender or I’ll mince you into pieces as revenge...”</p>
 <p>“Prime Minister, leave this little beast to me!” A loud cry came from the horizon. A billowing flame emerged as if there was a sea of fire in the sky.</p>
 <p>A person flew closer, accompanied by a great heatwave that seemingly wanted to boil the sea. The moment he stepped onto Peacock Land, a terrifying heat assaulted the earth. The vegetation nearby was instantly ignited.</p>
 <p>This was a middle-aged man with a stately presence. He didn’t try to hide his blood energy at all, instead letting it roam free. Divine rings opened around him as if he was a God-Monarch.</p>
 <p>A large Golden Crow existed inside these rings. It carried the sky and gave off a holy aura.</p>
 <p>Someone blurted after seeing him: “Golden Crow Monarch, the junior brother of the Extreme Yang Monarch!”</p>
 <p>Another murmured: “The Extreme Yang School is here, so it won’t be long till the Golden Isle and Void Imperfection Three Schools are here as well.”</p>
 <p>This man strode into Peacock Land and stepped onto a high peak. He looked at Li Qiye with a murderous intent in his eyes.</p>
 <p>The Golden Crow Monarch told the Turtle Minister: “Prime Minister, this beast killed my nephew. Out of consideration for our friendship, leave his dog life for me. I will take his head to my senior brother.”</p>
 <p>The turtle smiled and replied with haste: “Please go for it. Just leave his body so that I can also take it back to report.”</p>
 <p>This conversation made it seem like Li Qiye was already a dead man that couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
 <p>In fact, many didn’t deny the monarch’s strength. Although he was the Extreme Yang Monarch’s junior brother, he joined the school even earlier. Some believed that he became a paragon even before his brother.</p>
 <p>At this school, strength dictated seniority, not who joined the earliest.</p>
 <p>Because of his constitution, the Golden Crow Monarch couldn’t cultivate the Extreme Yang Physique, so his brother became stronger than him. Nevertheless, he was still a Prosperous Era Paragon, stronger than the Turtle Minister.</p>
 <p>Many held their breaths when they saw a paragon wanting to take Li Qiye’s life. Everyone could guess that Li Qiye was also a Virtuous Paragon. Who was stronger between these two?</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid the Golden Crow Monarch has the advantage.” Someone was more optimistic about the monarch: “After all, the Extreme Yang School is an Immortal Physique lineage that has stood strong for millions of years. Plus, he is a charming spirit; both his body and soul are innately superior from birth.”</p>
 <p>Many people felt that this was a reasonable statement. The monarch had many treasures since he came from a big sect — this was an advantage that not just anyone could have.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” A chain covered in a crimson light appeared in his hand. This flashing light made others shudder; its fiery light seemed to pierce deep into the bones.</p>
 <p>He held the chain with both hands and glared at Li Qiye: “Will you surrender, or do I have to force you by piercing your clavicles and dragging you around like a dead dog?” [1. In Wuxia, it is believed that when your clavicles are pierced, you can’t gather qi.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was still holding the cauldron. He slightly raised his brows and lazily responded: “Either come and die or scram, don’t disturb me.”</p>
 <p>The monarch was infuriated by this slight. He was a supreme expert, yet this junior held him in such contempt, prompting him to shout: “Little beast, die!”</p>
 <p>A clunk was heard after he declared his intention. The chain in his hands thrust forth like a scorpion tail, aiming for Li Qiye’s clavicles.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” However, against all expectations, the chain did not pierce Li Qiye’s clavicles. Rather, the other side of the monarch’s chain fell into Li Qiye’s hand.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave a deep shout: “Come here!” The chain that the monarch was holding suddenly coiled around his wrist.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The monarch was involuntarily dragged to Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The monarch heavily slammed into the Peacock Tree, the impact causing him to suddenly see stars.</p>
 <p>“Ugh!” Before he could recover from the dizziness, the chain coiled around the Peacock Tree once and turned back to wring his neck.</p>
 <p>“No!” The monarch was still screaming as his limbs convulsed. In a split second, he was bound to the Peacock Tree and strangled to death. His true fate wanted to break out of his body, but there wasn't any opportunity. His true fate was sealed within his body and perished alongside it.</p>
 <p>This all happened too quickly. People couldn’t even react in time to the monarch being strangled alive.</p>
 <p>“Go!” After seeing his death, the Turtle Minister was shocked. He ordered and ran with the rest of his men.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The chain soared like a true dragon. Before the turtle and his officials could dive down into the ocean, the chain wrapped around their necks.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” All of them crashed into the Peacock Tree.</p>
 <p>“No—” The group was scared out of their minds and screamed. Alas, their cries didn’t last long as they were also strangled to death and hung there on the tree.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, those who were strapped to the Peacock Tree all had their eyes wide open for they died with grievances.</p>
 <p>They came to get revenge for their disciples, but they didn’t expect to pay with their own lives in the process. They had truly underestimated Li Qiye’s strength. In their minds, a nameless human junior could only be an ordinary paragon at best. If he was stronger than this level, then he would have been quite famous already. Thus, they were confident in their victory.</p>
 <p>But alas, they couldn't have imagined that they wouldn’t be able to block even one move from him. They died indignant deaths full of unanswered questions.</p>
 <p>People were horrified to see these corpses hanging from the Peacock Tree and couldn’t help but shiver.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1216: Teeming Tribemaster</b></p>
 <p>While staring at the hanging corpses, one person quivered and murmured: “Another brilliant genius coming out of nowhere... Can he compare to the Profound God-Monarch, the Seven-seas War Goddess, the Swiftdao Celestial God, and the Seashield Heavenly Prince?” [1. These are their full titles, I’ll be skipping the adjectives later to make the flow better.]</p>
 <p>These people were the most powerful geniuses in the contemporary Heaven Spirit World. The four of them were considered to have the best chances of becoming Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>A big shot looked at Li Qiye and speculated: “It isn’t clear whether he can compare with this group, but in my opinion, he stands shoulder to shoulder with Daoist Lin and the Extreme Yang Monarch.”</p>
 <p>Daoist Lin and the Extreme Yang Monarch were also young prodigies in the Jade Sea. However, there was still a gap between them and the other four.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily glanced at the crowd while holding the cauldron and spoke: “If anyone is familiar with the Immaculate Expanse and Extreme Yang School, do me a favor and let them know that I am the killer. If they dare, come to Peacock Land to settle the feud. Don’t be ball-less cowards.”</p>
 <p>Many were dumbfounded after hearing this. This was blatantly provoking these two sects. It looked as if he wanted to go all out against them.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, even if Daoist Lin and the monarch had great self-restraint and were magnanimous, they still wouldn’t forgive Li Qiye. Otherwise, their sects would have no place in the Jade Sea in the future. And even without this provocation, someone else would send the news of these deaths to the two schools with haste.</p>
 <p>More and more people arrived outside of Peacock Land. Li Qiye simply ignored them and continued to drown the land and sea with his cauldron’s fire.</p>
 <p>Everything was ready, the only thing missing was the eastern wind. Once it starts to blow, he would finally be able to replenish the tree’s life.</p>
 <p>He continued to refine the fire until it merged with the land and seawater, disappearing without a trace. With that, he recalled the cauldron and sat at the base of the Peacock Tree to have a moment of repose with his eyes closed.</p>
 <p>Some people were shuddering while looking at Li Qiye waiting by the tree: “So courageous, opposing both the Immaculate Expanse and Extreme Yang School yet he still dares to wait for the enemies to come. Just how bold is this?”</p>
 <p>The truth was that many people couldn’t see through this human boy and his nonchalance despite knowing that enemies were approaching. To the disbelief of the spectators, he seemed to be certain of victory.</p>
 <p>He must either be powerful to an unreasonable level or had an invincible background.</p>
 <p>However, the strongest human lineage in the Heaven Spirit World was the Exquisite Valley, and the valley couldn’t oppose either of these two lineages, thus people became curious about his background.</p>
 <p>“I heard the Extreme Yang School and the expanse are preparing to go all out. They will not forgive this Li Qiye.” A well-informed person heard the news and whispered to the people around him.</p>
 <p>No one was surprised to hear this. The death of their disciples and Li Qiye’s humiliating provocation were beyond anyone’s self-restraint.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, they were wondering what these sects would use for their killing move. Would the monarch and Daoist Lin personally take action?</p>
 <p>Before people could wait for the expanse and Extreme Yang School to come and deal with Li Qiye, someone else was already here to cause trouble for him.</p>
 <p>“Human brat, pay for my son’s life!” A roar resounded across the heaven and earth. It came from the bottom of the sea and was powerful enough to shake its foundation.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” At this time, a tidal wave rushed out from the horizon with a momentum like ten thousand stampeding horses.</p>
 <p>“Splash! Splash!” Big fish jumped out of the water. Many of them were holding tridents and sabers with ferocious expressions. An insane number of fish leaped out of the water in an unstoppable manner like evil dragons.</p>
 <p>Outside of these fish, many experts with the body of a fish and the head of a human or full humanoid bodies rode the waves. They came in a menacing manner, as if they would tear apart anything that blocked their path.</p>
 <p>“Teeming Fish!” Someone cried out after seeing these ferocious fish in the distance.</p>
 <p>Many were shocked to see the sheer number of fish and quickly retreated. No one wanted to be in their way, lest they risk angering these fish and being completely eaten, bones included.</p>
 <p>They all ran out of the circle that had been drawn by Li Qiye beforehand so that the fish could rush forward.</p>
 <p>The notoriety of this tribe was well documented. No one wanted to become their feast. Moreover, this group ahead was extremely furious already.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, this great army surrounded all of Peacock Land as well as the coasts in the nearby vicinity. They blocked off all paths of retreat to devoid Li Qiye of any opportunity to escape.</p>
 <p>With more splashing, waves rose to the sky. These waves were carrying powerful troops, far mightier than the other Teeming Fish. All of them at least had a human body.</p>
 <p>Towards the front of the waves was an old man wearing a crown and a dragon robe. His eyes flashed with a frightening glint. Anyone could tell at first glance that he was quite ruthless.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured after seeing him: “The Teeming Tribemaster…”</p>
 <p>The crowd watched with bated breaths before the sheer amount of fish. One person estimated that there might be more than one million of them surrounding Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>The tribemaster’s eyes fell upon Li Qiye, the terrifying glimmer seemingly stated his intention to eat Li Qiye alive. Anyone would feel their knees weakening after being exposed to this glare.</p>
 <p>The cultivators retreated to a safe distance to watch. Everyone knew that Li Qiye had eaten dragon tendons before. He even decapitated the Teeming Crown Prince! Thus, it was not surprising to see the Teeming Tribemaster leading this great army to take care of him.</p>
 <p>Another spectator commented: “This will be a fight to the death.”</p>
 <p>“How can it not be?” A cultivator in the Charming Fragmented Realm added: “It is one thing to eat tendons in public, but he placed the prince’s head inside a box and gave it back to the Teeming Tribe. This is an irreconcilable feud that will only end with his death or the demise of the Teeming Tribe.”</p>
 <p>The majority agreed with this statement. This tribe had always been unified, so killing the prince would bring about mass vengeance. No one could protect Li Qiye from this fight.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured while looking at the blockade” “It looks pretty grim being enemies with the Teeming Tribe. Perhaps death is the only possibility.”</p>
 <p>People had fought the Teeming Tribe for many years. Some even attacked and destroyed their lairs.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how powerful they might be, they couldn’t kill all of the Teeming Fish. In the next generation, this tribe would multiply again for a counter attack and even extinguish the offspring of whoever assaulted them.</p>
 <p>“Human brat, if you kneel and surrender, I will only torture you to death. If you resist, I will kill your ten clans. I don’t care what power you are from or what your identity is, we will chase you to the ends of this world and kill all of your clan members and anyone who has anything to do with you!”</p>
 <p>People shuddered after hearing this declaration, true to the vengeful reputation of this tribe.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye finally stood up from the Peacock Tree to lazily look at the sea full of Teeming Fish. He smilingly said: “Only a bunch of ants that love to toot their own horns; you love to bully the weak yet are afraid of the strong.”</p>
 <p>“Do you really think your tribe is invincible due to your sheer numbers?” Li Qiye continued: “For countless years when many Immortal Emperors, sea gods, and treefathers want to eat dragon tendons, they would casually grab the fattest Teeming Fish, scrape off its scales, then cut them into slices before eating the tendon. Then, they would top it off with a plate of fish and drink soup stock made from the fish bones. What a pleasant and delicious meal…”</p>
 <p>“... It’s a shame that your tribe didn’t even dare to fart as these beings devoured you, only turning a blind eye to everything. Heh, you would only act arrogant against tiny sects.” Li Qiye shook his head and sneered.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1217: One Massacring One Million</b></p>
 <p>With that, Li Qiye glared at the Teeming Tribemaster and grinned: “Only an inept bunch boasting about how vicious you are every day. How domineering and aggressive, but ultimately, you’re still a bunch of turtles hiding in their shells.”</p>
 <p>Such contempt left the spectators slack-jawed. No one had ever thought that they would hear this level of blatant disdain towards the Teeming Fish.</p>
 <p>However, some secretly applauded him, especially those who had been bullied by this tribe before. They felt especially happy since his words resonated with their own thoughts.</p>
 <p>As a matter of fact, many knew that the Teeming Fish knew to pick their opponents very well. They weren’t ferocious to just anyone. For example, great hegemons like the Golden Isle, the Void Imperfection Three Schools, and Gu Chun’s Four Branches weren’t provoked by the Teeming Fish. Otherwise, they would have been slaughtered by the Immortal Emperors, treefathers and sea demons countless times.</p>
 <p>As for the other sects, they weren’t strong enough to kill all of the fish so more often than not, they would suffer losses to these fish without voicing their displeasure.</p>
 <p>“He’s right. Hmph! Rumor has it that the grand completion Immortal Physique users of Gu Chun’s Four Branches loved to eat dragon tendons, but no one has heard of the Teeming Fish attacking the four branches for revenge.” Someone couldn’t help say this out of dissatisfaction towards the Teeming Tribe.</p>
 <p>His senior was frightened and immediately covered his mouth. He slapped him and stated: “Are you tired of living? Even if you are, don’t drag the sect into this.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s words darkened the tribemaster’s old face. He felt like his chest would explode from anger as he trembled.</p>
 <p>The million fish in the sea had fire in their eyes while glaring at Li Qiye. If glares could kill, then Li Qiye would have died countless times already.</p>
 <p>A Teeming Fish angrily shouted: “Tribemaster, let us tear this little animal to pieces so our brothers can eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Let us eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!” The other fish immediately echoed the sentiment. Their furious roars soared to the sky and shook the sea.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were aghast after feeling the wrath of the fish and turned pale. Today was the day that they would witness the ferocity of the Teeming Tribe.</p>
 <p>“Devour me?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile before leisurely replying: “With a bunch of trash like you? Not to mention this army of one million, even if the billions of Teeming Fish in the Heaven Spirit World were here, I still wouldn’t give a damn.”</p>
 <p>This direct provocation left people exchanging glances with each other. Here were more than ten high elders of the tribe and even the tribemaster himself. At least ten Virtuous Paragons were here, not to mention the vast armies of soldiers.</p>
 <p>The tribemaster shouted: “Little beast, you will experience a fate worse than death! We shall stomp on your bones! My children! Feast on him!”</p>
 <p>“Kill!” The furious army crazily cried out before frenziedly rushing for Peacock Land. These waves of fish slammed straight towards the island as if wanting to break it apart.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and, with a buzz, a law emerged from his heavenly cauldron.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” In a split second, bubbles sprayed out of the sea. These bubbles looked just like little palms that began to grab the Teeming Fish. They grabbed all of them without exception despite their great numbers. Even the group of the tribemaster couldn’t escape. All were caught by these palms made out of water.</p>
 <p>“Activate!” The shocked fish took action and tried to slash through these palm-shaped bubbles. However, this water had been refined by Li Qiye to be one with the ocean. How could these Teeming Fish cut through it?</p>
 <p>“Too late.” Li Qiye gently smiled. With a boom, this area suddenly formed little cauldrons that ignited. The fiery cauldrons turned into huge palms that descended from the sky to grab the heads of these fish.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Miserable screams echoed across this land. These screams resonated with each other, creating a hellish scene. While listening to the ups and downs of this grim melody, anyone would feel that they were trapped in hell.</p>
 <p>“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” The hands made out of water began to pull. These fish’s heads and bodies were separated, and even their spines were being pulled out. This was an extremely scary spectacle.</p>
 <p>The tribemaster screamed: “No!” His body was being abnormally elongated. He tried to escape from the hands, but he still failed despite being a Virtuous Paragon.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he let out one last shriek and couldn’t escape the fate of decapitation like the rest.</p>
 <p>“It would be a shame to waste all of these lives.” Li Qiye smirked.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The cauldron flame changed again. These bubbles turned into stoves and instantly refined the million bodies into ashes. Their vitality was taken away and sucked into the Myriad Heavenly Cauldron.</p>
 <p>At this time, the flame that came from the sky turned into crimson chains and hung the fish heads in the sky.</p>
 <p>This scene was too spectacular and terrifying. The fish heads — still connected to their spines — were suspended in the air.</p>
 <p>“Blegh!” One person couldn’t bear this horrible scene and began to vomit. Many cultivators ran away from fear.</p>
 <p>Cultivators were accustomed to death, but slaughtering one million in one breath was truly rare. Not to mention, these fish were still hanging in the sky. This was a scene that no one had ever seen before.</p>
 <p>“It was a trap!” The paled and dazed crowd finally realized that a terrifying trap was planted in this area in advance.</p>
 <p>They also understood why Li Qiye warned everyone to stay out of the circle he drew. So it turned out that he was reminding people lest they be caught up in this as well.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, they thought he had an ulterior motive, but it turned out that he warned them with good intentions. Cold chills emanated from within as they began to sweat. They only left the circle to make way for the Teeming Fish. If it wasn’t for that, their ends could have been the same as these fish before them.</p>
 <p>“This must be a grand formation that harmonizes with the heaven and earth. Its power must be wondrous and must have taken more than just one day to set up.” A grand character from the previous generation understood the power of this trap after seeing the Teeming Tribemaster being unable to escape.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sweep through the crowd with his eyes and slowly uttered: “Go tell the Teeming Fish that I will be waiting here at Peacock Land. If they want revenge, bring it on. Or, they can cower with their tails tucked between their legs and never show their faces in the Heaven Spirit World again.”</p>
 <p>A lot of people’s hearts skipped a beat after hearing this declaration of war. Li Qiye had set up a grand formation here to wait for more Teeming Fish.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he looked at the few human cultivators and coldly spoke: “It is time for the human race to leave.”</p>
 <p>These humans shuddered and some of them left immediately. However, a few chose to stay in order to see the outcome of this storm.</p>
 <p>News of Li Qiye’s move spread across the entire Jade Sea in a flash. The listeners batted their brows after hearing about his massacre.</p>
 <p>“This person is ruthless with great schemes. Who expected him to kill one million Teeming Fish in this manner?” A sect master murmured with fear in his mind.</p>
 <p>“War is coming, the Teeming Fish will definitely not let this go.” A big shot from the Treant Race commented as well.</p>
 <p>“Not just them, the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse won’t let this go either, or else they’ll lose all face in the Heaven Spirit World.” An ancestor gently sighed.</p>
 <p>In a short amount of time, the Jade Sea turned quiet. Many people were looking forward to the events at Peacock Land. However, they were not concerned about the Peacock Tree. Their eyes were on Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>They all understood that his opponents had two choices: they could either fight a direct battle or avoid this trap and find opportunities to kill him later.</p>
 <p>However, avoiding this battle would be a huge blow to their prestige. The reputation established by their forefathers would be shattered overnight. If they were afraid of a single human boy, how could they guard their own territories in the future?</p>
 <p>By enduring the shame of having a million of their children massacred, no one would fear the Teeming Fish later on!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1218: Declaration Of War From A Million Kingdoms</b></p>
 <p>After a few days, the Jade Sea and the Teeming Fish were still silent. There were no movements from them.</p>
 <p>However, experienced big shots could smell that something in the air had changed: “The calm before the raging storm, who knows who the ultimate victor will be?”</p>
 <p>Everyone understood that Li Qiye had planted a trap for the Teeming Fish. At this moment, the question was whether these fish would jump into this pit or not.</p>
 <p>Several more days passed and the Teeming Tribe was still quiet. At this time, everyone thought that they had given up.</p>
 <p>“Li, listen up, my Nightcrystal Kingdom will accept the challenge. We shall have vengeance for our million dead brothers. We will not only kill you, but also your ten clans!” Eventually, one kingdom rose to the challenge. Its king sent out this fierce message.</p>
 <p>“A mountain of blades and a sea of fire still won’t be able to stop our Stonecloud Citadel’s determination for revenge. We shall slay Li Qiye!” Another lineage replied to Li Qiye’s challenge.</p>
 <p>“Without killing Li Qiye’s ten clans, our eight million strong Eastern Sea Kingdom will never return to our home!” One more declared war on Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“No matter how far you may be, we shall chase you to the very end for the crime of killing our comrades. Our Propitious Sea Kingdom shall offer Li Qiye’s head to our fallen brothers!” Another joined the fray.</p>
 <p>*** *** ***</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, the Teeming Fish from all over the seas accepted the challenge in succession. They all swore to kill Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Their cries echoed across the vast oceans, frightening many cultivators and lineages.</p>
 <p>Before this, the Teeming Fish claimed to have millions of kingdoms. Of course, people knew that this was only an exaggeration. However, after seeing one kingdom after another rising up against Li Qiye, they realized for a second time just how powerful and pervasive this tribe was.</p>
 <p>Another thing to note was that the tribe had been incredibly quiet the past several days, but in just one night, numerous Teeming kingdoms declared war all at once. People could faintly guess something from this.</p>
 <p>“Very good, come then, my butcher’s blade is waiting. Bring ten million, slay ten million, bring one trillion, I’ll slay one trillion! And as for the Immaculate Expanse and the Extreme Yang School, there’s no need to hide any longer, my blade is anxious to have its fill of your blood.” Li Qiye’s response was also quite fierce.</p>
 <p>“Insufferable Little Qiye, our Immaculate Expanse vows to never give up until you die.” The expanse responded without any reservation.</p>
 <p>“Human child, even if you prepare an inferno of blades, the greatest of formations, our Extreme Yang School will still annihilate you completely!” The Extreme Yang School sent out their answer as well.</p>
 <p>“Count our Ophidian Tribe in as well!” Another enemy of Li Qiye released a message.</p>
 <p>“And my Dual-Pupils Sect!” The sect master of this lineage also sent out a strong message: “Kill Li Qiye to rid the Heaven Spirit World of his evil!”</p>
 <p>“Very well, the nobodies want to play too. I don’t mind more debts; all of you can come, little children. Your grandfather will be waiting for you at Peacock Land!” Li Qiye’s laughter resounded across the ocean with an incomparably arrogant tone!</p>
 <p>Such an overbearing attitude left many people dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured: “This is how a man should be. Challenging the entire world with one’s own strength. Even if he dies, his life would still have been full of glory!”</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” On this day, huge waves were thrown into the sky and blotted out the sun. The entire Jade Sea was shaking because of this.</p>
 <p>The horizon turned white after loud explosions due to the monstrous waves being pushed up. If one had a high vantage point to look down from, they would definitely be rewarded with a majestic scene.</p>
 <p>Peacock Land was the area of the world's focus. Hordes of Teeming Fish came from all directions. Each legion had a different system and formation as they surged for this place.</p>
 <p>The countless kingdoms had mobilized at the same time with billions of fish in their armies. In both the sky and the ocean, only Teeming Fish could be found.</p>
 <p>There was no end to them, their ranks spanning as far as the eyes could see. Anywhere that light could reach was occupied by fish.</p>
 <p>The troops of this tribe from all over the world gathered to form a mighty army.</p>
 <p>“Oh mommy, the Teeming Fish are using all of their forces!” Many people nearly wet their pants after seeing this lineup. Those who came for the treasures no longer dared to linger behind and quickly ran away from this land of turmoil.</p>
 <p>“Damn humans!” Some of the human cultivators who were already here wanted to escape. However, the perimeter of Peacock Land was completely sealed by the Teeming Fish. These fleeing cultivators suffered attacks right away.</p>
 <p>Even though they were quite strong, they still couldn’t escape death for they faced billions of Teeming Fish. With miserable screams, they were instantly eaten by them. Not even traces of their bones were left behind.</p>
 <p>They died full of regret for not listening to Li Qiye earlier. If they had left as soon as possible, they wouldn’t have attracted this fatal disaster, resulting in a death without a burial.</p>
 <p>“Take out the heavenly mirrors.” Many lineages were worried about this grand event. No one apart from top experts dared to personally come and watch. The majority of the lineages didn’t want to miss this unique battle, so they didn’t mind wasting refined jades to activate their heavenly mirrors.</p>
 <p>Through the mirrors, they could watch the battlefield full of Teeming Fish.</p>
 <p>Fish heads were bobbing back and forth. The ferocious army was armed with tridents and harpoons. The glint of their weapons illuminated the whole sea. This was not a friendly sight for cowards to watch.</p>
 <p>Even the sect masters and royal lords were creeped out by this. The billion-strong army could tear through everything. Just a few bites from each of the soldiers could destroy an entire great power.</p>
 <p>“Messing with the Teeming Fish is like playing with a hornet’s nest.” A sect master murmured while breaking out in cold sweat.</p>
 <p>Another royal lord commented with anxiety: “Who would want to provoke these vicious fish alone outside of sea gods, treefathers, and Immortal Emperors?”</p>
 <p>“They aren’t only trying to kill Li Qiye for revenge this time. This is a showing of their military might, deterring the world by showing their frightening strength, lest others want to suffer the fate of genocide.” An ancestor was quite discerning.</p>
 <p>In fact, a few older ancestors knew this full well, especially those from experienced lineages like the Golden Isle or the Void Imperfection Three Schools. They had been around for too long.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye had dealt a great blow to the Teeming Fish to the point of trampling on their reputation and prestige.</p>
 <p>Eating dragon tendons publicly was humiliating to this tribe, but now, he even massacred a million fish and killed the symbol of their race — their tribemaster. This was shaking the very foundation and status of their tribe in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>If they didn’t kill him today, they would never be able to regain their fierce reputation. Perhaps the world would start to think that they were easily bullied. Many lineages would want to seize their territories and people would want to eat dragon tendons.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the tribe had united and managed to muster billions of troops. This was not only to kill Li Qiye, but also to show off their might and solidarity as a deterrent measure. Provoke them and face genocide!</p>
 <p>The Teeming experts crowded the sky and the sea. The terrifying experts up there were all in human form.</p>
 <p>These old men were dressed in gold and wore regal clothing since they were high elders and kings. There was no lack of Virtuous Paragons here.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was difficult to find a God-Monarch in the Teeming Tribe. The fish were quite weak in terms of cultivation. Not to mention charming spirits, they were very far behind compared to even ordinary sea demons.</p>
 <p>However, due to their large population, they still had quite a few Virtuous Paragons. The hard part was to have one of these paragons reach the God-Monarch level.</p>
 <p>Despite the exaggeration in the rhetoric regarding their numbers, the mass ahead was indeed too immense. No other lineage could gather so many children. This magnificent scene was something only the Teeming Fish could produce.</p>
 <p>Eventually, their kingdoms finished gathering their troops. At this time, the ophidian treants and Dual-Pupils Sect along with another dozen lineages had aggregated to form an alliance with the Teeming Fish to assault Peacock Land.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1219: The Teeming Fish On The Offensive</b></p>
 <p>“Boom!” The billions of fish attacking Peacock Land created a spectacular scene. Just the tidal waves rushing to the sky had an unstoppable momentum.</p>
 <p>Anyone would be aghast since the entire Jade Sea was quaking from their advance. Eventually, they stopped right outside the circle drawn by Li Qiye since they knew of the terrible trap waiting inside.</p>
 <p>The army looked at the millions of fish bones hanging in the sky and their fury rose uncontrollably. From foot soldiers all the way to fish kings, all reddened with rage and wanted nothing more than to tear Li Qiye apart.</p>
 <p>A Teeming King screamed: “We shall never return to our kingdoms before killing that little beast!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Never return until we kill his ten clans as well!” The shouts of these fish echoed to the sky.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye was still sitting at the base of the Peacock Tree. He lazily stood up to look at the horde and revealed a gentle smile: “I have always been a merciful and peace-loving person, so I shall grant all of you one last chance. Immediately scurry back to your homes like good little fish or I’ll kill all of you to the very root.”</p>
 <p>Such words enraged the fish even more. They angrily glared at him with intense murderous intent, more than enough to kill him thousands of times over.</p>
 <p>“Little beast, today will be your demise!” A fish king hovering in the sky shouted: “We’ll not only kill you, we’ll devour this land as well! But before that, we’ll take our time torturing you until you reveal your identity, then we’ll finish off your ten clans. Both the young and old men and women in your clans will cry in agony for the rest of their lives for daring to provoke our tribe’s prestige.”</p>
 <p>“A group of ants daring to talk about slaughtering a true dragon.” Li Qiye burst out in laughter: “None of you are qualified, not even if you had more people!”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Another fish king snorted: “Keep on gloating. You won’t be able to do so soon.”</p>
 <p>Through the heavenly mirrors, the spectators were still holding their breaths despite being countless miles away.</p>
 <p>“Gentlemen, please break this formation.” A fish king shouted at the horizon in order to call for reinforcements.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” A great formation consisting of more than ten exceedingly powerful charming spirit experts descended from the sky. It was easy to tell that they were at least at the high elder level due to their gray hair.</p>
 <p>Flames covered them as this grand formation was coming down. This terrifying fire instantly suppressed the area in a frightening fashion.</p>
 <p>“The Commanding Elder of the Extreme Yang School!” A sect master recognized the leader through the heavenly mirror.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Flames fell from the sky while bubbles soared from the water. Li Qiye’s formation immediately attacked the high elders.</p>
 <p>“Activate!” The elders shouted together and took out a cauldron. Their formation supported this cauldron, turning it into a gigantic divine cauldron.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom!” Explosions rang nonstop. This immortal cauldron crazily absorbed the flames from Li Qiye’s cauldron. Even the bubbles and seawater that had fused with his fire were absorbed, with the remnants falling back into the ocean.</p>
 <p>A royal lord murmured: “Extreme Yang Cauldron, rumored to be a great formation created by a grand completion Immortal Physique user.”</p>
 <p>“Not bad.” Li Qiye smiled. One could hear a crash followed by loud blasts. Countless laws surged from the sea in the form of gigantic chains. Each of them was as mighty as a mountain range; they tried to lock the Extreme Yang Cauldron.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think about it!” At this time, one more great formation appeared in the sky. The clanging of swords reverberated continuously as huge swords flew to the sky like blooming lotuses. With the blooming of these lotuses, the universal laws from the sea became much weaker.</p>
 <p>“Law Evading Sword Formation!” Someone else recognized this formation from the mirror and shouted: “This is the great formation of the Immaculate Expanse.”</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, both the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse paid a huge price to utilize their great formations. They wouldn’t give up until Li Qiye died.</p>
 <p>An old man inside the sword formation cried out: “Elders, together!”</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” Both the cauldron and sword formation exerted their maximum power. First, the cauldron was absorbing the fire from Li Qiye’s cauldron while the sword law evaded the chains made out of laws. It took all the grand dao power away from this technique.</p>
 <p>Under the two great formations, Li Qiye’s trap finally shattered since both his fire and chains were cut off.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The formations continued to maintain their highest level of power to suppress this region. In other words, if Li Qiye still had more traps or techniques placed here, they wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p>
 <p>“Little animal, your trick is just child’s play — can’t reach the apex.” A commanding elder of the Extreme Yang School spoke coldly after seeing the two formations working as planned.</p>
 <p>A high elder from this sect coldly uttered: “Killing our Immaculate Expanse disciples is deserving of ten thousand deaths! Be damned!”</p>
 <p>At this time, they felt that Li Qiye couldn’t do anything against the two formations even if he had other means. He was a fish on the chopping board, waiting to be killed.</p>
 <p>“It is too difficult for one person to shake a lineage.” Someone murmured while staring at a heavenly mirror.</p>
 <p>A royal lord said with worry: “The expanse, the Extreme Yang School, and the Teeming Fish are quite scary when they are working together. It looks like Li Qiye is really pushing them this time.”</p>
 <p>An ancestor lamented: “What a shame, this is a hero. The human race will lose such a good seed. This is what happens when you are too brittle and inflexible. His future was unlimited, but he was too arrogant and made too many enemies at once. This is him walking to his death.”</p>
 <p>“Little beast, today will be your funeral!” A fish king shouted: “Brothers, rush into Peacock Land. No dangers will deter our advance, we shall devour the entire land and tear this little beast into pieces!”</p>
 <p>“Devour the land! Tear the little beast into pieces!” The army chanted in unison. Their battle cry shook even the stars in the sky.</p>
 <p>Endless streams of Teeming Fish rushed for Peacock Land. At this moment, nothing Li Qiye did could deter their determination to destroy him. They were still far from reaching the land itself, but their momentum was already impacting the entire land.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye showed no sign of worry and instead revealed a beaming smile: “That was just for fun, now it is time for the real harvest.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, a buzz resounded. The Peacock Tree behind him suddenly emitted a blinding light of all kinds of colors.</p>
 <p>This divine light soared to the sky and overfilled the sky vault. It opened the nine heavens and derived a timeless primordial chaos.</p>
 <p>“What’s happening?” This sudden change caught everyone off guard.</p>
 <p>This light turned into a huge tail. The Peacock Tree suddenly disappeared from sight.</p>
 <p>A huge peacock emerged in the sky. Its wings blotted out the sun, suddenly turning the world dark. All that remained was the brilliance of the peacock and its five colors. The entire Jade Sea was illuminated by this five-colored divine light.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The peacock spread its tail. In an instant, a truly invincible aura pervaded the entire Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>There were no laws or moves, just the spreading of the bird’s tail suppressed all living beings. Even powerful paragons and terrifying God-Monarchs felt that they were mere ants before this invincible aura. They were too fragile and couldn’t reach the apex.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The peacock’s tail swept by and the billion Teeming Fish were suppressed. Both the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation were stopped as well.</p>
 <p>At this moment, neither paragons nor the powerful formations could move at all; they were completely pinned down. Even time and space were paused like a painting.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1220: Blood Refining All The Teeming Fish</b></p>
 <p>The Jade Sea was obscured by the peacock. It suppressed this entire world; even the top experts were watching this creature in silence.</p>
 <p>In a forbidden ground, an existence woke up and opened its eyes in the abyss, its dry bones radiating divinity.</p>
 <p>The majestic bird horrified all invincible existences. This was an unstoppable offense capable of sweeping through everything.</p>
 <p>“The Peacock Treefather.” Someone muttered in a very distant location.</p>
 <p>At this time, the ancient clans and powerful lineages were nervous with their hair standing on end.</p>
 <p>Even more lineages activated their heavenly mirrors. Many ancestors felt the impulse to kneel while looking at this scene.</p>
 <p>The exceedingly strong ancestors from behemoths like the Golden Isle and Void Imperfection Three Schools were astounded as well.</p>
 <p>A gray-haired ancestor gasped: “Is the treefather coming back to life?”</p>
 <p>The ancestors in this Void Imperfection sect couldn’t believe their eyes and murmured: “No chance. Once a treefather returns to the earth, it should be irreversible.”</p>
 <p>“This is not a resurrection.” The Golden Isle was a treefather lineage, so they knew much more. An ancestor murmured: “This is the treefather showing its spirit. Is it about to extend its life?”</p>
 <p>They knew that it was prohibitively difficult for a treefather to show its spirit. Outside of when their sects were facing imminent doom, they wouldn’t show their spirit even when they were about to wither.</p>
 <p>“I thought I would need to work much harder for the refinement this time… But the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation will act as the best alchemy furnace.” Li Qiye smiled while watching this scene.</p>
 <p>“Open!” He shouted. With a buzzing noise, this location lit up. The peacock’s tail suddenly spun in the air.</p>
 <p>An incredible thing happened. With sizzles, all of the frozen Teeming Fish were being erased.</p>
 <p>Their bodies seemed to be under the grinding of a polishing stone and slowly faded away. They could only watch as inches of their flesh were being removed; they couldn’t move or even scream.</p>
 <p>This terrible scene included the members of the Ophidian Tribe, the Dual-Pupils Sect, and their allied lineages. Nearly one hundred thousand disciples from these lineages were slowly being erased.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, this process continued across the lowest level of foot soldiers to the top paragon high elders, none could escape this fate.</p>
 <p>Eventually, both the fish and cultivators were ground into pools of blood. This was the most precious thing in their bodies — the blood that contained their longevity.</p>
 <p>All of these blood pools came together. Just imagine the sheer amount of accumulated blood from a billion fish. It cemented together into a bloody sea.</p>
 <p>“What…” Those watching through the mirrors were creeped out and trembled. A billion fish were ended just like this.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The Extreme Yang Cauldron controlled by more than ten high elders suddenly lit up. They had lost control of this great formation.</p>
 <p>“Splash! Splash! Crash!” At this time, Li Qiye took over the Extreme Yang Cauldron. The inexhaustible amount of blood was being fed to it.</p>
 <p>The sunfire within turned into a vortex in order to refine the endless amount of blood. During this process, the high elders inside the formation found their bodies slowly melting away. Their fire of life started to burn and the addition of their blood purified the mass even further.</p>
 <p>“Did you really think that a formation like the Extreme Yang Cauldron could swallow my cauldron fire? How naive. In this world, nothing is purer than the fire of life when it comes to alchemy refinement. Using your fire to refine and nourish the blood for a second time is truly perfect.” Li Qiye refined the sea-like blood using the Extreme Yang Cauldron.</p>
 <p>Eventually, all of the blood was refined and the sea of blood shrunk into a lake. The Extreme Yang Cauldron shattered as well. The high elders had become part of the blood, so they were destroyed as well.</p>
 <p>“Splash—” Li Qiye poured all of the Void Imperfection Water into the Law Avoiding Sword Formation. The high elders from the expanse that set up this formation could only watch themselves being drowned by it.</p>
 <p>“Void Imperfection Water, the supreme sacred aqua of the charming spirits.” Many people were envious to see Li Qiye using so much water to drown out the sword formation. They felt that he was being too wasteful.</p>
 <p>For charming spirits, even a single bottle of this water was extremely precious, but Li Qiye ignored all of that.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The high elders had lost control of their sword formation. The formation turned into an incomparably holy giant lotus. This was the ultimate form of this formation, capable of purifying and evading everything.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The Void Imperfection Water turned into a cauldron inside the lotus flower. At this moment, the purifying force of the formation was being pushed to the limit. The recently refined lake of blood was being sucked into this new cauldron.</p>
 <p>The lotus flower closed its petals and the blood was refined once more. Moreover, the high elders stuck inside felt their fate palaces opening. Their spring of life continuously flowed into the cauldron and was being thoroughly refined.</p>
 <p>Their blood energy, longevity blood, and dao force were gathered into their spring of life, and its water continued to pour outside. Their fate ended up being the same as the elders from the Extreme Yang School — slowly melting away.</p>
 <p>Even though this process didn’t look that scary, they were being robbed of everything. It drained their entire being and left behind nothing.</p>
 <p>“Using the fire of life to warm the blood and the water of life to purify it, nothing can be better than this.” Li Qiye smiled while controlling the cauldron: “It would have been too cruel if I had to catch dozens of experts to refine them alive into this medicine, right? Unfortunately, you all didn’t heed my warning and decided to come seek death by turning yourselves into medicine.”</p>
 <p>“The even bigger coincidence is that the Extreme Yang Cauldron and the Law Evading Sword Formation are quite suitable for medicine creation. The merit laws created by your grand completion Immortal Physique users consist of unrivaled hardness and peerless softness. Coming here to be part of my medicine creation, what else can I say? Thank you for helping me save a lot of time.” Li Qiye leisurely explained the process while refining the blood.</p>
 <p>After seeing this, an ancestor from the Void Imperfection School wondered: “Is this really a coincidence?”</p>
 <p>Eventually, the lotus flower withered and the blood was tempered once more. At this time, it no longer looked like blood, its appearance was closer to a treasure liquid. It exuded a wondrous light.</p>
 <p>Earlier, there was a lake of blood, but now this liquid was reduced to the size of a pond. There was primordial chaos lingering inside this pond, as if a world of stars was about to be born within. An entire universe was being gestated.</p>
 <p>“This kind of treasure liquid can really compare to chaos essence.” Many people were salivating while looking at this liquid. Even those without a clue still knew how precious it was.</p>
 <p>This was a liquid refined from a billion Teeming Fish. Its value could only be imagined.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took out the Heavenvine Calabash and began to cut it. An ordinary golden liquid poured out from inside, releasing a vibrant force of life. Each drop of this golden liquid contained infinite vigor. He added this golden liquid into the pond.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The two instantly fused together. At this time, everyone in the Jade Sea could feel a breeze full of exuberant life force hitting them. There seemed to be an extremely vigorous life being born in this pond of water, capable of taking root in the earth!</p>
 <p>Countless existences in the Jade Sea felt the great vitality being created. Even a dying piece of dry wood would have a second spring.</p>
 <p>“He is actually replenishing the life of the Peacock Tree so it can live longer!” An ancestor was dazed in front of their mirror. They finally understood what Li Qiye was trying to do!</p>
 <p>Countless spectators were astounded, some were moved, and many were silenced.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, someone had asked what Li Qiye was trying to do, and he answered truthfully. At that time, many people mocked and snorted at him. They viewed him with disdain and thought that this fool didn’t know his own limits.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1221: Life Replenishment</b></p>
 <p>However, in retrospect, the fool was not Li Qiye, but them. The most foolish were the Teeming Fish. Their arrogance and aggressiveness only helped Li Qiye in the end.</p>
 <p>“If I could have a share of this vitality, I would be able to live for another generation.” An ancestor murmured while feeling the abundant life force permeating through the world.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Thunder sounded in the sky with frantic lightning sparks. In the blink of an eye, a terrifying tribulation formed.</p>
 <p>This tribulation coalesced and the entire world turned dark as if the end of days was approaching. Each lightning bolt could tear apart this world or blow up an ocean.</p>
 <p>It formed incredibly quickly. Not to mention ordinary experts, even a Godking would be absolutely horrified. They would have to calculate how long they could survive this tribulation.</p>
 <p>A junior saw this tribulation and felt his legs go soft before murmuring in a daze: “What is that?”</p>
 <p>“The heavens’ punishment...” An ancestor slowly explained: “This type of life liquid made from a billion existences is a heaven-defying item. It goes against the harmonious order of this world, so the high heavens will definitely not allow for such an item to be created. The liquid itself might be innocent, but the drinkers will be committing a heinous sin!”</p>
 <p>A different disciple asked: “Will the Peacock Tree be able to withstand this tribulation?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.” This ancestor gently shook his head: “The stronger the person is, the stronger the heavens’ punishment will be. The tree’s original form is a treefather, thus it will have an invincible foundation. If it drinks this liquid of life, it will bring about a real heavenly annihilation! If it was someone weaker like a junior, then their seniors or experts could help them surpass this tribulation, but no one apart from an Immortal Emperor can help a treefather’s punishment!”</p>
 <p>Everyone watched their mirrors with bated breaths. They wanted to see whether the tree would drink this pond of valuable liquid or not.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye rushed to the sky after seeing the tribulation. He took out the jade bowl filled with the tears of mortals. At this time, he splashed it on the peacock itself while the peacock absorbed it all.</p>
 <p>After doing so, the bird emitted a faint brilliance of a crystal clear shade. Each wisp of light seemed to be stained with tears, as if countless commoners had cried and prayed for its existence.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shouted while looking at the heavens’ punishment: “Let’s get started!”</p>
 <p>“Roar!” The peacock swallowed all of the treasure water in the pond and disappeared from sight. Next, the Peacock Tree emerged before everyone again. It was still rooted in the earth.</p>
 <p>At this time, a green light gushed out from its body. Each strand of green light was full of life. A mighty vitality surged like a storm as these bright strands wove together. The endless life force began to be digested and integrated itself into the tree.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The punishment from the heavens finally descended. A gigantic lightning bolt came crashing down, capable of splitting the Jade Sea into two or even piercing through it completely.</p>
 <p>Countless existences in this region fell to the ground due to fear of this tribulation.</p>
 <p>However, an incredible matter happened. Both the lightning bolts and thunder waves only managed to come within a few feet of the tree before being stopped. It seemed that the bolts were only this long, that this was the extent of the thunder.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Many people were startled: “The Peacock Treefather is too powerful, even the heavens’ punishment can’t approach him!”</p>
 <p>The spectators didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
 <p>Eventually, a very ancient forefather noticed a clue and murmured: “It is not that the punishment can’t reach it! There is something protecting it that is untouchable, even by the Heaven’s Will! An impregnable law!”</p>
 <p>“What kind of law or item can’t be shaken even by the will of the high heavens?” A junior was very curious.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sneered and coldly uttered towards the heavens’ punishment: “Will of the high heavens! Damned old heavens, don’t forget, there are a few things that even the Heaven’s Will can’t violate. Many things can be destroyed or concealed, but not the truth observed by the world itself!”</p>
 <p>“These are the tears of countless mortals, the love and sympathy for all lives! The Heaven’s Will cannot change this! Damned old man, come down yourself if you dare, your will alone cannot change this order!” Li Qiye mockingly laughed at the incapable heavens’ punishment.</p>
 <p>However, the constant barrage of the punishment failed to make contact.</p>
 <p>“Even the will of the high heavens cannot touch this law, just what the hell is it?” A very ancient ancestor was astounded after seeing this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and declared: “Very well, my turn!” With that, he opened his fate palace and the pillar of life emerged.</p>
 <p>At this time, a branch from the Peacock Tree stretched out and propped behind Li Qiye’s back. Its five-colored light illuminated his body. A tree appeared behind him like a peacock spreading its beautiful tail.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This pillar of life fiercely penetrated the heavens’ punishment.</p>
 <p>The tribulation responded by sending more lightning bolts straight at Li Qiye to tear him apart.</p>
 <p>However, the five-colored barrier behind him stopped all of the bolts from coming close to him. Even though this barrier was cracked, the Peacock Tree once again exuded its light to make the barrier whole.</p>
 <p>This tribulation was aimed at Li Qiye, so it was much weaker compared to the previous one. The Peacock Tree was powerful enough to shield Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The pillar of life was inside the sea of lightning. Runes emerged from it to form a symbol as it spread its dao. This was the Ancient Void Rune. Li Qiye then relied on it to crazily absorb the lightning and thunder of the tribulation until it ran dry.</p>
 <p>“This is crazy!” People watching from their mirrors couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
 <p>“This brat is insane, he is using the Peacock Tree to help him squeeze out the punishment’s power. Since the start of time, how many people actually dared to seize this power for their own?” An ancestor applauded this bold action.</p>
 <p>Everyone was speechless after seeing this. Even though the tree was protecting him from the tribulation, he dared to send his own pillar of life into the punishment itself. Not too many people would dare to take such a risk.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the lightning slowly disappeared. The thunder died down since the field up in the sky had been sucked dry by Li Qiye. Thus, the tribulation vanished.</p>
 <p>His pillar of life had turned purple. Even though others couldn’t see it, they could still feel its power after absorbing enough from the tribulation. A mighty power was now contained within.</p>
 <p>Once the pillar returned, the spring, tree, and cauldron of life all resonated with each other. The new power of the pillar allowed them to benefit as well.</p>
 <p>The Life Origination was melting faster inside his spring of life. The augmentation thanks to the tribulation allowed the spring to become strong enough to dissolve this drop.</p>
 <p>He recalled his fate palace and sat down at the base of the Peacock Tree. He closed his eyes and began to rest by channeling his energy.</p>
 <p>“A great risk bears a great harvest.” An ancestor muttered: “It doesn’t matter whether this human boy is strong or not, he utilized this rare timing to steal the heavens’ punishment, so he’ll enjoy this great benefit for the rest of his life.”</p>
 <p>“He is quite lucky to have been protected by the Peacock Tree and allowed to obtain the power of the tribulation.” A descendant of a great power became quite jealous.</p>
 <p>“Look, a new branch is forming on the Peacock Tree.” Someone noticed a new development through their heavenly mirror.</p>
 <p>Many turned to look as well. Sure enough, on top of the old roots of the Peacock Tree, a new green branch that carried unlimited vitality appeared.</p>
 <p>“A successful life replenishment, this is way too heaven-defying.” Even ancestors gasped before this scene: “He has actually revived a nearly withered ancestral tree, this is incredible.”</p>
 <p>A dying ancestor enviously spoke: “The Peacock Tree really obtained a rebirth from this. After this, even if it can’t live for another lifetime, it can definitely survive another eight or ten generations, maybe even longer.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1222: The Frightened World</b></p>
 <p>As it was shrouded in a green light, the Peacock Tree quickly emitted a mist that covered all of Peacock Land. At this time, even heavenly mirrors couldn’t see through it, so no one knew what was going on inside.</p>
 <p>The Jade Sea became silent again, and the same went for the ancestors watching from the distance.</p>
 <p>What happened today was too shocking. It could even be said that many didn’t know how to start talking about it.</p>
 <p>A blood ceremony of one billion Teeming Fish had incited a heavens’ punishment. Ultimately, the Peacock Tree’s life replenishment was successful. It became one of the most incredible miracles across all the eons.</p>
 <p>Even those who witnessed this miracle with their own eyes couldn’t comment on it. Some were very curious about the current state of Peacock Land, but no one dared to step inside, not even to the nearby sea regions.</p>
 <p>At least this was the case for now because they didn’t know the Peacock Tree’s attitude towards outsiders. If it was angry, then regardless of how strong one might be, they would only be seeking death. Thus, the only thing to do was to wait until everything returned to normal before going there.</p>
 <p>“This was an amazing strategy.” After a while, an ancestor commented: “Who knows how strong Li Qiye’s cultivation is? But this was quite a frightening plan. One would be hard-pressed to top it.”</p>
 <p>“But was it really Li Qiye’s strategy?” A big shot was skeptical about this. Many great powers were debating this matter privately.</p>
 <p>A sea demon ancestor contemplated before speaking: “Everything was too perfect, there were zero issues. Could a nameless junior actually do something like this? Only an experienced strategist with great vision could pull off something of this caliber.”</p>
 <p>Antagonizing the Teeming Fish, the Extreme Yang School, and the Immaculate Expanse before sacrificing all of them… Perhaps his choice of these three factions was made through careful deliberation.</p>
 <p>The Teeming Fish was a ferocious tribe and would definitely seek revenge with their full force. What was more important were their sheer numbers. No other race in the Heaven Spirit World was more suitable.</p>
 <p>The Extreme Yang School was a hard yang lineage and also had a great formation, the Extreme Yang Cauldron. It was the best type of cauldron for blood refinement. Meanwhile, the Immaculate Expanse was a soft and mild lineage. Their Law Evading Sword Formation was great for tempering the treasure blood.</p>
 <p>These three together were mutually beneficial. There couldn’t be such a coincidence, especially when the cauldron and sword formations were taken into account.</p>
 <p>Such means didn’t only involve strategy, but also great knowledge as well as the ability to have absolute control of the situation.</p>
 <p>Strategy, knowledge, and absolute power were indispensable in this plan. Without any of them, it was impossible to achieve this miracle. Because of this, an ancestor from a treefather’s lineage had to ask: “Can this young junior, who was completely unknown, come up with this type of scheme or have so much insight?”</p>
 <p>The other big shots here were quiet while the other ancestors mused the question.</p>
 <p>“This great scheme must have been concocted by the Peacock Tree. Only a character like a treefather would be able to come up with this great plan to complete the blood refinement. A mere human junior can’t possibly do such a thing.” After thinking about it, many felt that this great plan wasn’t something a junior could fabricate.</p>
 <p>In the entire Heaven Spirit World, no young genius could do so. This was heavily debated by these senior characters. For example, the Profound God-Monarch, the Seashield Prince and the Swiftdao God most likely didn’t have the ability to carry this out.</p>
 <p>Thus, they concluded that Li Qiye was only carrying out the strategy of the Peacock Tree. He was a blade used in this situation to carry out the terrifying blood refinement.</p>
 <p>However, there was a problem with this train of thought. Many people knew that once a treefather returned to the earth, it was the same as returning to the origin. They would no longer have their own intelligence, no longer be able to communicate with others.</p>
 <p>So even if the tree was the one that planned all of this, how did it communicate with Li Qiye?</p>
 <p>“There is only one possibility.” A great character from another treefather’s lineage answered: “He must be a controller. Li Qiye is the Peacock Tree’s controller; only controllers are able to communicate with ancestral trees.”</p>
 <p>“A tree controller, hmm.” An ancestor murmured: “It is very difficult for a treefather’s lineage to produce a controller. In the legends, even the Golden Isle only had one controller.”</p>
 <p>“No matter what, the Peacock Tree has carried out the life replenishment successfully.” The sect master enviously spoke: “Peacock Land has finally been saved.”</p>
 <p>Since this land wasn’t destroyed, it remains a treefather’s continent. Anyone or any lineage would covet it. Unfortunately, the land has only accepted humans even till this point. It didn’t grant entrance to the three great races for millions of years, so only humans settled down at Peacock Land.</p>
 <p>While others were discussing the great blood refinement, the Void Imperfection Three Schools who had more information was quiet. Compared to the speculating ancestors, they knew who actually did it. However, they didn’t wish to discuss certain matters with others. Or rather, they weren’t willing to share this crucial information with outsiders.</p>
 <p>As for someone who was privy to everything, Kong Qinru chose to stay quiet as well by burying this matter deep in her heart. She wouldn’t even disclose it to those closest to her.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know how to feel about the whole endeavor. Should she be afraid of Li Qiye’s awe-inspiring means or sympathize with the death of a billion Teeming Fish? Perhaps she should be excited about the successful life replenishment…</p>
 <p>Prior to this, she understood what Li Qiye wanted to do from his implicative words, but she still made a choice to help carry out the terrible blood refinement.</p>
 <p>Like he said, there was no free lunch in this world. There would always be a great price to pay, and it wasn’t something that she or the Exquisite Valley could afford.</p>
 <p>Some might say that the Peacock Tree and Li Qiye were too cruel by carrying out the blood ceremony. It was a vicious plundering of life.</p>
 <p>Alas, even more were happy. For many cultivators and sects, the disappearance of a billion Teeming Fish carried great significance. It meant that the territories of the seas were freed up. This would be a great and long feast for many marine kingdoms and tribes in the upcoming days!</p>
 <p>An expert stated: “Since the start of time, supreme experts have always marched through countless bones, so it is no big deal that the Peacock Tree sacrificed a billion fish for its own life. This is a world of the strong, and the Peacock Tree stands at the top. Even if it devours all of the Teeming Fish, it is completely understandable.”</p>
 <p>At this time, the majority believed that this blood ceremony came from the Peacock Tree.</p>
 <p>“Well yes, the Jade Sea will be much more peaceful without these Teeming Fish, more resources have been freed up for the other tribes and lineages. They would have been purged already if it wasn’t for their swift reproductive capabilities. Maybe there will be more room for growth out of this.” Many sects were applauding this development, no one even thought that it was too drastic.</p>
 <p>In their opinion, these fish were the locusts of the sea. They crazily multiplied and took up too much room. Many sects had been dissatisfied with them, but they couldn’t do anything out of fear of the fish’s great numbers.</p>
 <p>Now, they were refined by the Peacock Tree and lost around seventy to eighty percent of their forces. Perhaps in all the corners of the oceans, one would find it difficult to find a lineage unhappy about this development outside of the Teeming Fish themselves.</p>
 <p>The truth was that many marine sects and kingdoms had taken swift action to occupy the territories of the Teeming Fish. In just one night, war raged across the oceans as people vied for resources.</p>
 <p>Until now, the Teeming Fish had taken too many territories in the marine regions so today, outside of capturing resources, various tribes and lineages also wanted revenge since the Teeming Fish robbed them of it in the past!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1223: Quiet Aftermath</b></p>
 <p>Peacock Land was still very quiet. The day came and went with no one daring to enter. They were afraid of the Peacock Tree’s wrath and another terrible blood refinement.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye also enjoyed the calm and peace during this period of time.</p>
 <p>In fact, many people had shifted their attention to the wars for territories and resources. The majority of the sects and kingdoms were busy waging battles in the Teeming Fish’s marine regions. They didn’t have the time or energy to enter Peacock Land. At the same time, the Teeming Fish became a dog with a dead owner overnight; they were ganged up on by almost everyone.</p>
 <p>The breeze gently blew under the Peacock Tree. At this time, it looked completely different with verdant leaves. It emitted an exuberant aura after the replenishment. It was clear that it would be able to live for a long time.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s harvest was quite sizable as well. He was able to devour the heavens’ punishment, giving him the ability to solve the problem of the Life Origination.</p>
 <p>He was quite content with his gains since he was only missing one out of the four mysteries of the fate palace. Currently in his possession were the Ancient Void Rune, the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter, and the Life Origination. If he could gather the final piece, it would be nearly complete for him.</p>
 <p>He eventually opened his eyes after a while, feeling quite comfortable with a strange sensation due to the great vitality, similar to a rebirth. While glancing around, he noticed an exquisite jade table in front of him and a stove with smoke curling out of it.</p>
 <p>There was also the sound of burning wood. On top of the table was boiling spring water at just the right temperature. The water was heated right when he woke up.</p>
 <p>A pair of gentle porcelain hands were preparing tea with a pot and cup. All the movements were quite smooth and natural, showing great mastery.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took note of the master of these hands. It was a charming beauty. Even though she was still a maiden, she already had the sexiness of a mature woman like a ripe peach that others couldn’t help but want a taste of.</p>
 <p>Who could it be besides the schoolmaster of the Sacred Spring School, Zhuo Jianshi?</p>
 <p>She sat in a proper position while pouring tea for Li Qiye. This gentle and docile demeanor made her look like a newlywed bride.</p>
 <p>He only smiled and took the jade cup, taking his time to sip the tea without saying anything.</p>
 <p>After he finished, she poured another cup for him with the same grace. At this time, Kong Qinru appeared on the peak and stood there quietly.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi noticed her arrival and put down the teapot then quietly left. She didn’t say a word from start to finish.</p>
 <p>Kong Qinru came forward and kneeled before Li Qiye. Being the valley lord didn’t diminish the respect she showed him.</p>
 <p>She looked at him and said: “Young Noble, I’m afraid I have to go back. The sect has summoned me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and replied: “Go, a feast is about to begin. Many lands have lost their master with continuous wars being waged. The Exquisite Valley requires you to preside over these matters, so of course you will have to leave.”</p>
 <p>She added: “If there is more news about the person you are trying to find, the valley will let you know right away.”</p>
 <p>He only nodded without saying anything else.</p>
 <p>Eventually, she asked: “When will we meet again?” She knew that he was only passing through the Heaven Spirit World. There was nothing here that could make him feel sentimental.</p>
 <p>“We will meet again if it is meant to be.” He smiled: “You have a great ambition, a drive for change. Keep on trying, one can only be successful through perseverance. Dreams alone will not accomplish anything.”</p>
 <p>She responded in all seriousness: “I will engrave your guidance in my heart.”</p>
 <p>He nodded again and continued to drink his tea. The steam coming out from the cup seemed to be covering his face, causing Kong Qinru to stare at him in a daze. It was as if he was hiding in the mist; no one could see through his unfathomable self.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he looked at her and asked: “Anything else?”</p>
 <p>She hesitated for a moment before answering: “Schoolmaster Zhuo is quite exceptional. The Sacred Spring School was initially in a marriage pact with our Exquisite Valley. The schoolmaster’s fiancee was my first brother. Unfortunately, he died from misfortune before the two of them could marry. Schoolmaster Zhuo has been living as a widow for his sake. This can only be praised as having great loyalty and virtue…”</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh before shaking his head: “Are you trying to find a wife or a concubine for me? Or perhaps a bedwarming maid?”</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare.” She said in a serious manner: “I was only afraid that you might have misunderstood.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “Don’t worry, nothing can elude my gaze or trick my mind.”</p>
 <p>She took a deep breath and respectfully bade farewell: “Young Noble, I hope that we can meet again. I will not let you down in the future.”</p>
 <p>With that, she drifted away and disappeared.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked down to continue drinking his tea. After a good while, Zhuo Jianshi eventually returned to the side. She poured more tea for him in the same natural manner.</p>
 <p>Inside the tea’s mist, he looked at her and leisurely smiled: “Is this your own will, or is it the hope of the old geezers from your three schools?”</p>
 <p>She only quietly sat there. It seemed that she would always be incredibly elegant and mature. This kind of noble grace made her even more attractive.</p>
 <p>“If I can follow Young Noble, it will be our three schools’ honor.” Her soft voice was especially pleasant.</p>
 <p>He smiled and said: “What do you want? Or rather, what does your Sacred Spring School want? A whale rider or an imperial seed?”</p>
 <p>She pondered for a bit before softly answering: “Young Noble, what are you willing to give us?”</p>
 <p>He leisurely responded: “I don’t need to leave behind anything for your three schools. In fact, I don’t owe you anything, it is the other way around.”</p>
 <p>The truth was that Li Qiye simply didn’t want to care about these matters in this generation. Even though he was friends with Immortal Emperor Wu Gou, he didn’t need to protect the Void Imperfect Three Schools and definitely didn’t need to leave anything behind for them.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, she gently sighed with a slight frown on her beautiful face. Even this expression had its own charm. Others couldn’t help but want to make her happy again.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued to sip on his tea. In his eyes, all of this was as ephemeral as the wind and clouds.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he suggested: “If, say, I want you to warm my bed since the only thing I want from your school is you, will you agree?”</p>
 <p>She contemplated for a bit before looking straight at him while giving a sincere response: “Young Noble, if you fancy me, it would be my honor.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and shook his head: “I am not someone who likes to force others.”</p>
 <p>“She might be unwilling, but I’m not.” A coquettish voice came about at this time: “I want to follow you and stay by your side, Young Noble!”</p>
 <p>This voice was particularly enchanting and could steal someone’s soul away. Just by hearing it, one would imagine that it was a very charming woman.</p>
 <p>A woman fluttered closer with the wind. Before even seeing her appearance, one would already be enraptured by her. Each of her steps was quite graceful, like a willow leaf amidst the breeze. Her ethereal bearing would draw countless uncontrollable gazes.</p>
 <p>She stood before Li Qiye while dressed in a black robe that couldn’t hide her peerlessly beautiful posture. Her willow-like waist was apparent through the thin, silky cloth. Her bottom half had perfectly round buttocks that were accentuated even more by the black cotton yarn.</p>
 <p>A dark gossamer top hid her well-rounded breasts, very few brushes could capture their soul-stirring gorgeousness. It was indeed a difficult endeavor to describe them with words.</p>
 <p>In particular, they would sway in an astonishing manner with each of her steps. This was truly not for the faint of heart. She came before Li Qiye and deeply bowed: “My name is Liu Ruyan, nice to meet you, Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>She was very close to him. An intoxicatingly pleasant smell was carried by the wind. In this close proximity, one would suddenly have the illusion that they were embracing her while basking in her delightful fragrance.</p>

 <p><strong>Chapter 1224: Liu Ruyan</strong></p>
 <p>The woman ahead had her face hidden behind a black veil. Regardless, just by looking at her graceful and slender figure that was accentuated by magnificent curves on top of her barely visible valley was more than enough to fill the heart with euphoria.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi slightly frowned while sitting at the table after seeing this woman. However, she still maintained her elegance and calmness before speaking: “Little Sister Liu, do the elders know that you are here?”</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan let out a charming smile capable of inciting lust. She didn’t mind Zhuo Jianshi’s question: “Who among the elders doesn’t know that I love to interfere with your business? It wouldn’t be good if they knew I was here.”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi had expected this answer, so what else could she say?</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-5e72"><span>Li Qiye was still hidden behind the curling steam rising from his teacup as he looked at her and chuckled: “The descendants of the Liu Clan are all femme fatales. It looks like you have also inherited your ancestors’ bewitching abilities. This is indeed a great disaster for all living beings. Moreover, it looks like your Evil Devourer Graceful Law is not bad either. Your clan is a bit interesting to have this variation of the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique.” </span><a href="#footnote-5e72">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-d17f"><span>“Young Noble, you speak as if only our Liu Clan specializes in seduction. Many people in the Heaven Spirit World call the women of our clan vixens.” She chuckled while staring at him in a bold and direct fashion. </span><a href="#footnote-d17f">[2]</a></span></p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed after hearing this: “Well, the women from your clan are indeed vixens, including your progenitor. Even though people say that she was a grand completion Immortal Physique user, she couldn’t complete the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique and instead ended up with this type of seductive physique. She was a beautiful temptress of the nine worlds that drove countless men crazy.”</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-ead3"><span>“I am honored to hear such praise from you, Young Noble.” She covered her mouth while laughing. Despite being covered by a veil, her eyes could pass on amorous feelings. When she stared at Li Qiye, they were luminous with autumn ripples. </span><a href="#footnote-ead3">[3]</a></span></p>
 <p>Li Qiye shook his head and smiled: “Girl, there is still a long way to go if you want to seduce me. Try again after you reach grand completion with your physique. With the skill you have right now, you are only embarrassing yourself.”</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-d52c"><span>Liu Ruyan wasn’t offended at all. She gave a charming smile and said: “Since you say so, when I reach grand completion, I’ll try to see if I can get you into my red curtains.” </span><a href="#footnote-d52c">[4]</a></span></p>
 <p>“Take me into your red curtains?” Li Qiye was quite amused: “You can almost qualify to be mine alone, but for me to marry you... Don’t dwell on this idea.”</p>
 <p>“So you are saying that I still have a chance?” She flirted with a seductive chuckle. It was just as Li Qiye had said, this woman was definitely a vixen.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi was still calmly sitting nearby despite Liu Ruyan’s flirtatious behavior. Her mature and elegant charm would make others palpitate in a different manner.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled back at Liu Ruyan. He looked over at Zhuo Jianshi and asked: “Who is in charge of the Void Imperfection Three Schools right now?”</p>
 <p>So it turned out that Liu Ruyan was the current schoolmaster of the Evil Devourer School. However, the Evil Devourer School and the Sacred Spring School had a very interesting relationship due to the intricate relationship between their two physique laws.</p>
 <p>The physique law of the Sacred Spring School was the Surging Golden Spring Law while the Evil Devourer School’s law was the Evil Devourer Graceful Law. One cultivated into the Sacred Spring Physique while the other the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique.</p>
 <p>The schools had three Immortal Physique laws. In addition to the two previously mentioned, the third was the Void Imperfection Physique Law.</p>
 <p>Originally, these three should have nothing to do with each other. The Void Imperfection Physique was from the word “Pure” in the Physique Scripture. The Sacred Spring Physique originated from the word “Soft” while the Heaven Devourer Evil Physique came from the word “Yin”.</p>
 <p>However, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou couldn’t obtain the Physique Scripture, thus his physique law was taught to him by a predecessor. In the end, he created the Void Imperfection Windchase Law.</p>
 <p>This physique law created by the emperor was naturally weaker than the one in the scripture. Because of this, it also included some other things.</p>
 <p>Inside this Windchase Physique Law were essences of pureness and softness. From this, future descendants had different interpretations. During the era of the Sacred Spring School’s progenitor, this person was able to understand the mysteries of the Windchase Law’s softness to create the Surging Golden Spring Law.</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-cea4"><span>Furthermore, because pureness originated from softness, it meant that softness also carried the Yin affinity. </span><a href="#footnote-cea4">[5]</a></span></p>
 <p>In order to make this Immortal Physique law even purer to avoid qi deviation during cultivation, the Sacred Spring Progenitor forcefully changed this physique law and removed the softness within the Yin affinity.</p>
 <p>It was precisely this need for constant correction in order to successfully train the Surging Golden Spring Law that gave birth to the Evil Devourer Graceful Law later on.</p>
 <p>It started with a female disciple. She was a femme fatale level beauty with a rebellious nature. She looked down on this correction, so she chose to go in the opposite direction of the Surging Golden Spring Law.</p>
 <p>Her aptitude was very scary. Her reverse derivation of the Immortal Physique law had even surpassed her predecessors. She understood the word Yin and created the Evil Devourer Graceful Law.</p>
 <p>Because the graceful law was derived from the golden spring law, the future Sacred Spring and Evil Devourer Schools would often mess with each other.</p>
 <p>The Sacred Spring School believed that the graceful law came from the surging spring law, so their law was stronger. On the other hand, the Evil Devourer School believed that their graceful law was the result of surpassing the limit of the surging spring law, so their law could replace the former.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was no result to this competition because the two schools had never produced another person that could reach grand completion, let alone one for each physique at the same time.</p>
 <p>However, they saw hope in this generation with Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan. They were both extremely talented and cultivated their respective physique laws. The Void Imperfection Three Schools felt that they could finally see two grand completion Immortal Physique users in this generation. If this was the case, then the Sacred Spring School and Evil Devourer School could have a chance to see which was stronger.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when the two girls were only ordinary disciples, they often clashed. And the competition didn’t end after they became schoolmasters. Whenever they were together, a fight would surely break out.</p>
 <p>One could say that this was their fate, the reason for their continuous struggle until their final showdown at grand completion. Of course, it was not a life and death fight for these two. After all, they were still sisters from the same sect.</p>
 <p>She revealed a lovable smile and said: “Though Sister Zhuo is older than me by half a generation, if we are talking about the leader of the Void Imperfection Three Schools, then it can’t be anyone but me.”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi calmly answered: “The current leader of the three schools is First Brother.”</p>
 <p>The First Brother Zhuo Jianshi mentioned was the schoolmaster of the Void Imperfection branch because he was the oldest in their generation and had joined the sect the earliest. In the school, many of the disciples had been taught by him before. Thus, he was not only their First Brother, but also their master of sorts.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan chuckled in response: “Sister Zhuo, First Brother has been talking about stepping down so the role will fall onto one of our shoulders in the future, but I feel that I am much more suitable than you.”</p>
 <p>Her claim was not because she wanted to seize power and take control of the Void Imperfection Three Schools, it was because the two of them had grown accustomed to competing with each other since the early days. It was not a good thing for the two to meet since it would always end with either Zhuo Jianshi challenging Liu Ruyan or the other way around.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi sat there, neither supporting nor retorting to Liu Ruyan’s claim. Her demure and mature aura were truly special.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked after finishing another cup: “What are you here for?” Zhuo Jianshi poured another cup for him, as if this had always been the case.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan smiled coquettishly in response: “To steal Sister Zhuo’s man. I heard the ancestors have high hopes for her and I feel that I am not lesser in any way, so why can’t I vie for her lover as well?”</p>
 <p>Such provocative words were let out in an incredibly trivial manner. Liu Ruyan had no semblance of a bashful girl.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Li Qiye looked at her and smilingly replied: “That’s not necessarily the case. Perhaps I prefer gentle and virtuous women.”</p>
 <p>“I have never claimed otherwise.” Liu Ruyan sat down next to him with a soul-stealing allurement: “These are two different matters. Young Noble, you can like virtuous women and still have a taste for a seductive beauty. These two things aren’t mutually exclusive, right?”</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-6053"><span>“A little interesting, you are indeed a descendant of the Liu Clan.” Li Qiye was not shaken by her bewitching. </span><a href="#footnote-6053">[6]</a></span></p>

 <div id="footnote-5e72">
  <p>1. “This is indeed a great disaster for all living beings” — I’m not sure if this makes that much sense for English readers, but it is a very common phrase to describe a beauty that can bewitch everyone <a href="#footnote-ref-5e72"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div>
 <div id="footnote-d17f">
  <p>2. I know I used vixen in the past for the Storm God, but this is a different word. A direct translation would be fox demon/spirit. It just means a really attractive girl that will steal your man away or someone who uses their beauty as a tool. It probably comes from folklore where these fox spirits will actually seduce males for various reasons <a href="#footnote-ref-d17f"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div>
 <div id="footnote-ead3">
  <p>3. Luminous with autumn ripples just means amorous/flirty glance <a href="#footnote-ref-ead3"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div>
 <div id="footnote-d52c">
  <p>4. The issue here is that they are using literary idioms that are meant to be seductive without being crude. During marriage/wedding night, the bed would be decorated with red linen/curtains. So here, she is talking about sex/marriage, but in a literary manner. It sounds better in Chinese for sure since I’m having a hard time coming up with an equivalent way to ask for sex that contains the same character exposition and intent. Some of the descriptions about women or flirting can be lost in the translation since our author likes to keep it classy and literary. If he did so in a modern style, then it would be much easier to translate these passages <a href="#footnote-ref-d52c"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div>
 <div id="footnote-cea4">
  <p>5. This is probably based on fengshui or some old daoist scriptures, but since the author isn’t explaining the relationships, just take it for what it is. Even Chinese philosophers who dedicate their whole life to learning the Book of Changes and similar pieces of literature don’t understand these esoteric texts completely, let alone Bao who can’t reach the apex <a href="#footnote-ref-cea4"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div>
 <div id="footnote-6053">
  <p>6. One last note, I’ve been moving away from some awkward phrasing with honorifics since it is too awkward to repeat it continuously in some cases. But of course, with this, we are trading off some of the tones and intents. For example, Liu Ruyan might seems a little abrasive here with her cockiness, but she is speaking politely towards Zhuo Jianshi and Li Qiye by calling herself Little Sister, addressing Zhuo Jianshi as Big Sister, and Li Qiye as Young Noble <a href="#footnote-ref-6053"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1225: Three Women Competing For One Groom</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at her and said: “Who knows, maybe I am a little eccentric, wanting only what I can't have and have a distaste for things that come too easily.”</p>
 <p>“That’s not a problem either.” Liu Ruyan smiled back: “Many things can slowly change. As long as you stay with me, you will come to find that I will not disappoint you. Maybe you will like me then.”</p>
 <p>“Possible.” Li Qiye had an amused glimmer in his eyes as he stared at her: “But maybe I am someone who has a penchant for someone else’s wife. A little girl like you is not attractive to me.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, are you saying that you wish to embrace both me and Sister Zhuo and take your time savoring us?” Liu Ruyan winked seductively and smiled: “That’s perfect, I will help you. Maybe I can even train Sister Zhuo to be more sexy and obedient in her service.”</p>
 <p>She spoke in an incredibly natural manner with a touch of naughtiness that added to her charm.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and gently shook his head: “If your Void Imperfection Three Schools wants to use the honey trap against me, I can only say that your geezers really don’t understand me.”</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan faintly smiled in response: “I don’t know whether the ancestors told Sister Zhuo to tempt Young Noble or not, but I definitely didn’t receive this order. Of course, if she wants you to stay at the Sacred Spring School, then I must win you over.”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi frowned after hearing this. She replied: “Sister Liu, this is not a personal issue between us two. If you want to invite Young Noble to the Evil Devourer School as a guest, then I wouldn’t object and would even be excited for you. If he is willing to stay at our three schools because of you, then you would become a great contributor to our school.”</p>
 <p>“Sister Zhuo, you are mistaken.” Liu Ruyan shook her head: “I don’t care about becoming a great contributor, I simply want to steal your man. I still can’t understand why you always listen to those old geezers’ arrangements for the sake of the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Do you really think you can sacrifice everything for this goal?”</p>
 <p>She continued on: “For me, my path is below my feet. Each person should walk their own path. If Sister wants to keep him behind out of your own volition, then I am fine with it, but if it is for the Void Imperfection Three Schools, then I will definitely take him from you.”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye continued to drink his tea in a carefree manner as if this had nothing to do with him.</p>
 <p>After saying her piece, she looked at Li Qiye and playfully winked: “Are you not angry at what I said, Young Noble?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and continued to drink his tea.</p>
 <p>“Bah, two shameless vixens daring to seduce my husband?!” At this time, a fiery shout rang from the distance.</p>
 <p>A woman came from the sky. No, to be more accurate, it was a little girl with flowers blooming from each of her steps.</p>
 <p>She came barefoot on these fresh flowers like a descending goddess.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked over and smilingly shook his head after seeing the girl.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Does your Void Imperfection Three Schools have no shame? You are schoolmasters yet you two are trying to seduce my husband, how shameful.” Ye Xiaoxiao stepped under the Peacock Tree with both hands posturing on her thin waist, glaring at Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Little Sister, you are too young to be this anxious for marriage.” Liu Ruyan chuckled: “Trying to find a husband at this young age is a little shameful, don’t you think?”</p>
 <p>Ye Xiaoxiao maintained her powerful glare: “Who is being shameless here? Hmph, you are trying to seduce someone else’s husband in broad daylight, you are the ones throwing your face away!”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi shook her head after seeing the fierce girl and answered gracefully: “Princess Ye, you are mistaken. You have yet to marry Young Noble Li, so you can’t claim that he is your husband. I’m afraid this is your one-sided belief.”</p>
 <p>“That’s true.” Liu Ruyan chuckled provocatively: “Little Sister, he would be your husband once you two are married. You must be too little to understand this.”</p>
 <p>“Your head is little!” Ye Xiaoxiao quickly retorted: You dare to steal my husband? I’m going to teach you a lesson.”</p>
 <p>This girl had no qualms at all and casually prepared to attack. With a buzz, a wooden sword appeared.</p>
 <p>This wooden sword seemed to be made from thousands of divine swords as its sword energy was absolutely frightening. With a clank, countless swords slashed vertically towards Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
 <p>“Hey, are you really attacking?” Liu Ruyan smiled and reached forward. Her fingers turned into a phoenix that soared towards the numerous divine slashes.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhuo Jianshi remained seated there, proud and completely fearless. She simply waved her sleeve and swept away Ye Xiaoxiao’s wave of swords.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Think I’m afraid? Even if you two come together, I’ll still beat you down into submission!” Ye Xiaoxiao shouted and waved her hand. Divine trees materialized and formed a formation to trap the other two women.</p>
 <p>After seeing Ye Xiaoxiao becoming serious, both Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi didn’t want to underestimate their opponent. They stood up at the same time before roaring as they leapt towards the trees.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” With both of them attacking, Ye Xiaoxiao was definitely at a disadvantage. After all, they were older than her and they both trained in Immortal Physiques so they were no joke.</p>
 <p>Xiaoxiao was still young so it wasn’t easy for her to go one-on-two. Her divine trees couldn’t entrap these two.</p>
 <p>“Sister Zhuo, if the two of us pick on Little Sister Ye, people will laugh at us.” Liu Ruyan smiled: “You do you, I won’t fight together with you.”</p>
 <p>With that, she pointed her sword at Zhuo Jianshi.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi was no slouch either despite her graceful bearing. As a schoolmaster, there were times when she needed to be aggressive as well. Thus, she unleashed a divine seal and said: “I also want to see if you have improved recently!”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to teach both of you a lesson!” Ye Xiaoxiao didn’t show any weakness. She summoned a huge vine that turned into a giant that joined her in fighting the other women.</p>
 <p>The dueling ladies shouted at the same time and retaliated against the gigantic vine.</p>
 <p>Very shortly, the fight became a brawl with no one giving an inch. The fight rushed into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, not bad at all.” Li Qiye clapped while watching this duel.</p>
 <p>The three neither held back nor did they care for his praise. Even the vault of the sky was being shattered by their attacks.</p>
 <p>They could be described as kingdom-toppling beauties. When they really went at it, it was a very beautiful sight to behold.</p>
 <p>“Aizz, three supreme beauties fighting so viciously for a man. This man is too blessed.” A groan came about.</p>
 <p>A wooden boat landed on Peacock Peak. It didn’t matter whether it was land or sea, the boat could easily travel through all terrain.</p>
 <p>A young man with a dashing appearance was sitting in this boat. He wore an ivory-colored robe and was in great spirits. There was a hint of maturity in his demeanor as well.</p>
 <p>He watched the three women fighting in the sky and enviously told Li Qiye: “When will I become as lucky as you, Brother? To be able to make the Sacred Spring Schoolmaster, the Evil Devourer Schoolmaster and the little princess of the Golden Isle fight each other... such romantic luck is truly enviable.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled in response and continued to watch the fight.</p>
 <p>“This little brother is Buzhan Feng.” The youth cupped his fists and smiled at Li Qiye: “In my opinion, the three ladies won’t be able to come to a conclusion anytime soon. Will you give me the honor of having a drink together?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the youth and smiled back before taking one last glance at the girls. Then, he stepped onto the boat and sat down.</p>
 <p>“Go.” Buzhan Feng laughed and said: “Brother Li, sit tight.”</p>
 <p>He then grabbed the paddle and began to row it as if through water.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh!” This wooden boat traveled at frightening speeds. It immediately shattered space and this sea region. All of a sudden, they were in the middle of a vast ocean.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat there without asking Buzhan Feng about their destination. He simply enjoyed the scenic views along the way.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng was rowing his boat and looked at Li Qiye before sincerely stating: “I am full of admiration for Brother Li’s intelligence. It seems that nothing in this world can shake your dao heart.”</p>
 <p>“You are not bad as well.” Li Qiye lightly grinned: “To be able to cultivate the Buzhan Clan’s martial arts to this level truly demonstrates your firm dao heart.”</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1226: Buzhan Feng</b></p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng sighed after Li Qiye revealed his identity: “Brother Li is indeed a tree controller, you were able to see through me right away. For millions of years, those who have earned the favor of the ancestral trees have always been part of the most magnificent crowd. Today, you are no lesser than any of the old sages.”</p>
 <p>So it turned out that Buzhan Feng was from the Buzhan Clan, the descendants of Immortal Emperor Buzhan. Outside of the Heaven Spirit World, the uninformed thought that the emperor was the one who founded this clan, but this was not the case. [1. Buzhan = Warmarch or stage of war.]</p>
 <p>A very long time ago, before Immortal Emperor Buzhan came to be, the clan was already an ancient lineage with the surname Buzhan. Some even thought that this clan was older than Gu Chun’s four branches.</p>
 <p>Even if it wasn’t the oldest clan in the Heaven Spirit World, there would be very few older than it.</p>
 <p>As the successor of this clan, Buzhan Feng was quite powerful. However, just like his clan, he was not very famous in this world when compared to the top geniuses like the Swiftdao God, the Seashield Prince and the Seven Seas Goddess. He was even less renowned than the Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin due to his penchant for keeping a low profile.</p>
 <p>Of course, the clan itself was very low-key. Outside of Immortal Emperor Buzhan’s generation, the clan had always acted in this manner. Some people guessed that this had something to do with their origin.</p>
 <p>The Void Imperfection Three Schools rarely appeared as well. Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan maintained low profiles, albeit in a different manner from Buzhan Feng.</p>
 <p>To be more precise, the three schools had a pragmatic reason for doing so while the two women had this type of personality. At the same time, the three schools didn’t vie for reputation or prestige. However, if there was something that was beneficial for the schools in question, they would definitely pursue it.</p>
 <p>The Buzhan Clan was much more extreme in this regard. Their disciples rarely showed themselves in this world. Moreover, they had no interest in worldly affairs.</p>
 <p>Many believed that the Buzhan Clan was doing this to preserve their strength. Others also thought that there were circumstances that forced them to be like this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled at the praise. Many people had mistaken him for a tree controller and thought that he was the lucky guy chosen by the Peacock Tree. However, he didn’t care too much about this misperception.</p>
 <p>The wooden boat rushed forward at breakneck speeds before landing on an island. The waves were quite lively here. One island after another covered this region like jewels on the sea. It was a particularly beautiful scene.</p>
 <p>There were oceans everywhere in this world, but not just anyone could claim the islands as their private property. The Buzhan Clan’s main base was located at the Abyss Sea, but they still had properties in the Jade Sea. From this, one could see just how influential they were.</p>
 <p>The youth took Li Qiye into a courtyard with artificial lakes and bubbling springs. This place had a feminine aura, so it was easy to tell that the owner of this house was a woman.</p>
 <p>There was a little island on the artificial lake with water flowing under the connecting bridge. The dripping water created a very pleasant beat.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked further and saw a woman sitting in a pavilion at the top of this island. Her back was facing them as her jade-white fingers plucked the strings of her zither. A transcendent sound was created by her wondrous skill.</p>
 <p>Even though he couldn’t see her face, it was clear from her slim and graceful back that she must be quite a looker with no room for criticism.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, let me introduce my big sister to you.” Buzhan Feng smiled and said: “Even though she rarely shows herself, I can guarantee that she is the prettiest girl in the Abyss Sea.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and said: “Don’t tell me you are trying to find a husband for your older sis, or perhaps a stallion? If that’s the case, forget about it.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, you can’t put it that way. Everything is up to the word ‘fate’.” The youth smiled back before raising his voice at the girl on the island: “Sister, let me introduce a friend to you. This is Brother Li, an exceptional contemporary genius. He is the guardian of the human race, the successor of Peacock Land, and one who has been personally taught by the treefather. One would be hard-pressed to find his match in the entire world.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he heard Buzhan Feng brag about him. Since when did he become the guardian of the human race and the successor of Peacock Land?</p>
 <p>At this time, the woman stopped playing her zither. She didn’t turn her head and only said: “Little Feng, your friend is my friend so I welcome him here, but if you want to be the same as Father by trying to find an imperial bloodline to pass on our line, then sorry, excuse my lack of reception.” Without a doubt, the big sister knew just what her brother was up to.</p>
 <p>“Sis, you can’t put it like that. Brother Li is incomparably outstanding.” He didn’t give up and continued his boastful spiel: “He came from a distinguished family while still being humble and dignified. In my eyes, the Seashield Prince’s group can’t compare to him.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Forget about this. If you are still interested, let’s have a drink.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng couldn’t do anything else but catch up to Li Qiye. Nevertheless, he still looked back at his sister and shouted: “Sis, think about it, maybe you two will fall in love at first sight…”</p>
 <p>His sister ignored his nonsense and quietly played her zither. The melodious song began to play again.</p>
 <p>Although Buzhan Feng failed the introduction, he still entertained Li Qiye very well. In his own pavilion, he took out the hidden wine that he had been fermenting for Li Qiye to drink.</p>
 <p>After carefully tasting the wine from the clan, Li Qiye put down the cup and nodded his head: “The old wine from your clan is indeed worthy of its fame.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng laughed and said: “My wines are not considered high quality at all. The ones from the ancestors back home are the best of the best. If you want, you can come have a taste at our clan.”</p>
 <p>He poured another cup for Li Qiye after saying this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “If your clan is trying to find a groom or whatever, I’ll have to pass since I have zero interest in this kind of thing.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, you can’t be so sure about that. My sis is the number one beauty of the Abyss Sea, she’s definitely not inferior in the slightest compared to the Exquisite Valley Master. Plus, I’m not one to brag, but she is beyond virtuous. In this regard, she does not lose to Schoolmaster Zhuo, and in terms of beauty, she is a match for Schoolmaster Liu as well…”</p>
 <p>“... So, if you two stay together for a bit, maybe you will be attracted to each other and become something more.” He was trying his best to sell his sister.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely drank the wine and chuckled: “This is our first meeting yet you are introducing your sister to me already. Are you not afraid of pushing your sister into a fire pit?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not worried at all.” The youth smiled back: “What kind of people are the geezers from the Void Imperfection Three Schools? They’re as crafty as ghosts and sly like foxes, and they want nothing more than to marry Schoolmaster Zhuo to you. The old men from the Golden Isle also want you for their groom. Since you are such a hot commodity, I can represent my sister and hook you two up without any apprehension.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and shook his head since he didn’t want to dwell on this topic: “Forget the matter of grooms. However, if there is a chance, I do want to visit the Buzhan Clan to see the ancient scrolls left behind by your ancestors.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng hurriedly replied: “Brother Li, you are indeed special with extraordinary vision, ordinary people can’t compare to you. They only want to see treasures and technique manuals at our clan, but you want to read the ancient books.”</p>
 <p>He smiled and continued: “It is no big deal if you want to read our books, just marry my big sis, then we’ll be family. With my sis asking the ancestors asking in your stead, it will be very simple. You probably don’t know, but my big sis is their favorite. The ancestors dote on her more than me, the successor.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye helplessly waved his sleeve at Buzhan Feng who was not giving up on trying to sell his sister: “Don’t mention this again. I have zero interest.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Buzhan Feng had to drop it and smiled: “Then I won’t bring it up again, but I’m still confident that there is a lot of time left. There is still a chance for the two of you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye had to smile back since he understood that the Charming Spirit Race had always been interested in the procreation of their race and stallions.</p>
 <p>In fact, he wasn’t the only one lacking interest in this matter. Buzhan Feng’s older sister opposed this matter as well.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1227: Origin Of The Buzhan Clan</b></p>
 <p>The two continued to drink their fine wine. Even though Buzhan Feng came from an ancient clan, he was still very amiable and humorous to the point where others would hesitate to end the party.</p>
 <p>After another round, Buzhan Feng put down his cup and said: “Brother Li, this might be intrusive so I don’t know if I should ask or not.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly said: “Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng stated in a serious manner: “In my humble opinion, Brother Li must not be from the Heaven Spirit World. Of course, if you don’t want to talk about it, we’ll just pretend that I didn’t say anything.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took another sip and casually asked: “What makes you say that?”</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, you are a hero in the contemporary, a dragon that will soar to the nine heavens, destined to be a prominent Godking.” The youth smilingly answered: “In my opinion, you didn’t debut just now, and yet you are completely unknown in the Heaven Spirit World. Thus, I believe that you are not from here.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled and glanced at the youth: “It is no secret. You are right, I am from the Mortal Emperor World.”</p>
 <p>“Just as I thought!” He patted his thigh triumphantly: “I must be eighty to ninety percent right then.”</p>
 <p>“It looks like you have more to say.” Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and smirked at the boy: “And here I thought you only wanted to introduce your sister to me.”</p>
 <p>“No, no, Brother Li, don’t misunderstand.” Buzhan Feng bowed to apologize with great sincerity: “I really did ask you to come here so that I could introduce my big sis to you, but at the same time, I also wanted to ask a few questions.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly took another sip. After a good while, he said: “Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>“This little brother wants to ask you about the great vortex.” Buzhan Feng hurriedly replied: “Please teach me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly said while squinting his eyes: “It looks like you know a lot.”</p>
 <p>“No, of course not, this is pure speculation. Your appearance is too coincidental and was right around the time of the fluctuation from the vortex. Therefore, I came up with a bold guess, you must have gone there.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked slowly: “Do you have some intentions towards the vortex?”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng took a deep breath and earnestly spoke: “I won’t hide it from you. Brother Li, I am very concerned about the vortex. As the successor of the Buzhan Clan, this is also my responsibility. Perhaps you don’t know about the origin of our clan, but I can let you know that there is a reason why we are here at the Heaven Spirit World. We are more closely connected to the vortex than any other lineage.”</p>
 <p>“I know a bit about this matter.” Li Qiye calmly revealed: “Your clan has always been linked to the vortex. Outsiders do not know the reason why, but the answer to this question traces back to the origin of your clan.”</p>
 <p>“You know?” Buzhan Feng was surprised because outsiders shouldn’t know about this. Even some disciples in the clan were unaware. As the successor, he was privy to more information than his peers. Nevertheless, he still didn’t know the secrets behind this relationship.</p>
 <p>“There aren’t many things that I don’t know.” Li Qiye leisurely said: “If your clan can understand your own beginning, then it will come to understand its relationship with the vortex. Moreover, it will also clear up the origin of your Charming Spirit Race.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sipped his wine and leisurely said: “In other words, if your Buzhan Clan’s genealogy was a historical script, then it would be one about the history of the charming spirits. If there are blank spots in this race’s history itself, then there will be answers within your clan. However, that is based on the premise that you can figure out your own origin first.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s words shocked Buzhan Feng. He stared at Li Qiye in astonishment and murmured: “Brother Li, you know much more than I expected. To have such insight... It seems that I’m inferior in this aspect.”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing. When you go to many places, you will learn many things.” Li Qiye put down his cup again.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng quickly refilled Li Qiye’s cup and continued the conversation in earnest: “The truth is that I’m confused about many things as well. All of it seems to be hidden in a fog throughout history. So please, guide me out of this maze.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and answered: “There’s not much I can teach you. If you think I came this time for the vortex, then that would be wrong. I just happened to be passing by and played around a bit."</p>
 <p>After a while, he went on: “If you want to ask me about what is at the bottom of the vortex, if there are things that relate to your clan or the charming spirits, then my answer is that I can’t tell you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye plainly explained: “The things there are also related to the origin of the sea demons and the final destination of the treants. Just like the sea demons at the Bonesea and the Divine Tree Ridge for the treants, outsiders can’t explain it to you. A true answer has to be figured out on your own.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng murmured to himself: “The Bonesea and Divine Tree Ridge for those two races...”</p>
 <p>Eventually, he looked up over at Li Qiye and speculated out loud: “Are you saying that our origin is similar to the sea demons and treants?”</p>
 <p>“No, you are off in this case.” Li Qiye smiled: “Why is it that you charming spirits are considered the favored children of the heavens instead of the sea demons or treants? Why is it that sea demons don’t want to leave this world and the treants will always return no matter what? There are many similarities, but the real reason, the true answers, are completely different.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng began to ponder while murmuring: “I think I’m seeing something here. When treants die, they begin the process of atavism and take root in the earth. For generations, the sea gods also have to be accepted by the Trident. Only with it would they be qualified to fight Immortal Emperors.”</p>
 <p>This issue had been repeatedly explored for many generations. Why did treants have to return to the Heaven Spirit World? Some said that even if they went to other places, they would come back to this world to die. Only by dying here would they be returning to their roots.</p>
 <p>As for the sea demons, everyone could understand that no other places in the nine worlds were more suitable than the Heaven Spirit World. After all, the entire place was practically a vast ocean. Where would they rather go than here?</p>
 <p>However, something that was quite peculiar to many researchers was why sea demons didn’t become Immortal Emperors and instead became sea gods. Another interesting thing was their most powerful artifact, one that could even suppress Immortal Emperors — the Trident.</p>
 <p>What was the secret behind the Trident? Where did this powerful weapon come from?</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stared at the absent-minded boy and said: “If a real answer is what you seek, then you must go to the vortex; it can give you the answer. Of course, you must get through it alive first.”</p>
 <p>“Go to the vortex?” Buzhan Feng took a deep breath and smiled wryly before shaking his head: “I’m a very confident person, but I know I am not qualified to go to the vortex. That is beyond my abilities. Even if there are answers there, I would be torn asunder before reaching its end. If even Godkings can’t do it, there’s no way I could.”</p>
 <p>“If I remember correctly, your forefather, Immortal Emperor Buzhan, went there in the past.” Li Qiye smiled and slowly uttered: “He is one of the few Immortal Emperors that was obsessed with the vortex, much more so than the other emperors.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng was silent for a bit before eventually answering: “I heard the ancestors say that our forefather really did go in there. According to legend, he actually made it to the bottom.”</p>
 <p>Here, the youth helplessly shrugged before continuing: “But when His Venerableness came back from the vortex, he rarely talked about this matter. Nothing was said about what he saw down there, so our clan doesn’t know much about the bottom of the vortex.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not exactly difficult to find out more.” Li Qiye drank another cup: “If I am not mistaken, your emperor left behind two top-secret imperial edicts. Open the second one and perhaps you can get some answers.”</p>
 <p>“How do you know that?!” Buzhan Feng was frightened after hearing Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Like I said, there are very few things that I don’t know. “ Li Qiye nonchalantly stated: “Normally, Immortal Emperors would leave behind one imperial edict. If an emperor leaves behind two, then the second one would entail a heaven-shattering matter relating to an eternal secret. It is not something the world should find out so easily, only real experts that have reached a certain level are qualified to learn it!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1228: Imperial Edict</b></p>
 <p>“How do you know so much…?” Buzhan Feng became more and more frightened throughout this conversation. He was jolted into standing up and stared at Li Qiye in disbelief.</p>
 <p>There were several types of imperial edicts. Some acted as proclamations to the world, others were orders given to the emperor’s generals, and another type was meant to be kept in secrecy.</p>
 <p>These secret edicts were normally left for the emperors’ descendants. Moreover, they were not to be opened unless the requirements were met. Otherwise, not even the children of the emperors could open them.</p>
 <p>Only talents that satisfied all the requirements would be able to open these secret edicts. Moreover, they would never disclose the contents to anyone, not even their closest friends and family.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored the apparent shock in the youth’s expression. He sat there calmly and enjoyed the wine before speaking: “Didn’t I tell you already? There’s not much that I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng stared at Li Qiye in disbelief. If it was anyone else, then they would be suspicious that Li Qiye was spying on their clan. However, Buzhan Feng knew that this wasn’t possible. If he, as a disciple, didn’t even know about it, how could an outsider figure it out?</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath and sat back down. While staring at Li Qiye, he smiled wryly and shook his head: “If Brother Li knows so many secrets already, you should also know that I’m not qualified to open the secret edict. If I could do so, I wouldn’t be asking you right now.”</p>
 <p>The level required to look at these edicts was usually the Immortal Emperor realm or something very close. Some said that supreme Godkings could look at them as well, but the future generations didn’t know if this was true or not.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “I know that you are not qualified, but don’t tell me that no one has seen it in your clan. This might fool others, but not me.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng quietly pondered for a moment. There was indeed someone in the clan who was qualified to do so. However, they wouldn’t necessarily disclose the contents to him.</p>
 <p>He revealed: “We do indeed have someone qualified to read it, but this is not the right time. At the very least, this was the case for that ancestor.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “If your clan won’t assist you in this matter, then I can’t help you either. There are some things that you need to work for and, when necessary, you will need to break the rules.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng gently sighed. After a brief pause, he looked at Li Qiye and said in a serious manner: “I know a little bit about the legends regarding the vortex and our Charming Spirit Race, but I do have some questions.”</p>
 <p>With that, his attitude became very respectful and sincere.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly sipped another mouthful of wine and said: “Go ahead. Since I have drank your wine, I will think about answering if possible.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng began: “As I speculated, Brother Li has gone to the vortex. You also know that we have always been watching it. When one goes there, screams and roars seem to come from its depths. The world quakes before them, is this right?”</p>
 <p>The boy was very careful with his words lest Li Qiye became unhappy.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the boy and said: “I know what you want to ask. You are afraid of the beginning of some unwanted matters.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng nodded in response: “I am indeed very worried about this. This is our clan’s mission. There have been rumors that one day, the inevitable shall come and it will bring about a disaster to us charming spirits.”</p>
 <p>“It does exist.” Li Qiye said: “However, this is a needless anxiety for you right now. You don’t know that the charming spirits in this world have left certain things behind. This disaster won’t be able to descend on a whim.”</p>
 <p>With that, he stared at the youth and continued: “In the Heaven Spirit World, the true power of the Charming Spirit Race is beyond your imagination. And also, if your forefather, Immortal Emperor Buzhan, was able to make his way down there, surely he would have left some precautionary measures behind.”</p>
 <p>“And here is the final statement.” Li Qiye raised his cup: “I’ll be borrowing an old saying; one might be able to survive an act of god, but no one can survive a self-brought calamity.”</p>
 <p>“One might be able to survive an act of god, but no one can survive a self-brought calamity...” The youth carefully thought over this line from Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I have said all that needs to be said, drink up.” Li Qiye laughed and took another gulp.</p>
 <p>The youth calmed down and quickly poured another cup for him.</p>
 <p>Since Buzhan Feng insisted on him staying, Li Qiye remained on the island. In these last few days, the youth came to ask Li Qiye many questions. Whether he answered or not depended on his mood and the nature of the question.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng could be said to be a very studious person, someone who had no shame in asking and learning from even his own subordinates. His questions for Li Qiye had nothing to do with cultivation or merit laws. The majority of them were interesting anecdotes.</p>
 <p>A person like him was quite rare. The Buzhan Clan had an exceedingly high position in the Heaven Spirit World so he, as the successor, had great authority. However, he had no visible arrogance or contempt for others. The majority of disciples from the great powers had some pride in them; even if they didn’t bully others, they wouldn’t try to learn from those they deemed inferior.</p>
 <p>However, Buzhan Feng didn’t feel that his intelligence was superior to others. He acted as a junior before Li Qiye in his inquisitive quest for knowledge.</p>
 <p>It was precisely due to his commendable personality that Li Qiye decided to teach him a thing or two. If it was another successor from a great power, Li Qiye would have ignored him completely.</p>
 <p>The youth didn’t give up on trying to set up his big sis with Li Qiye, but regardless of his efforts, there was not the slightest sign of progress.</p>
 <p>His sister had no interest in this type of marriage or the bloodlines from stallions. She was even against it, so no matter how much Buzhan Feng tried to persuade her about how great Li Qiye was, she remained aloof.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was even more tired of this matter and was too lazy to go see his sister. In the end, Buzhan Feng had no choice but to give up.</p>
 <p>He helplessly said: “Sigh, Brother Li, I really do want you to be my brother-in-law. Then, we can be even closer, right?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t want to be rude and only smiled at the boy’s wish to connect the two.</p>
 <p>“Really, Brother Li, everything about my big sis is great, it’s just that she doesn’t like to talk about marriage. She views inter-clan marriage as a type of transaction, but we do think that if you two stay together, you will be able to win her over with your charm.”</p>
 <p>“Trust me, girls will swoon over your charisma.” The youth persuaded: “Let me arrange it so you two can have a talk under the moonlight.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “People will meet if it is meant to be. If not, then it shouldn’t be forced.”</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng sighed as another attempt at matchmaking failed.</p>
 <p>After several more days at the island, Buzhan Feng came and told Li Qiye some news: “Brother Li, you said you wanted to go to the Dragon Demon Sea? There is news that I’m sure will interest you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked: “What news?” After staying here for a while, he had been wanting to leave the Jade Sea for the Dragon Demon Sea because Su Yonghuang had gone there. He wanted to see what clues she was after.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng quickly said: “I heard a skeletal horse has appeared in that region. It is only bones and keeps on running like crazy. No one knows where it came from. The cultivators there tried to capture it to no avail since it is way too fast. A God-Monarch from the sea demon race tried himself, but he still failed.”</p>
 <p>“Skeletal horse?” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“So you are interested.” Buzhan Feng smiled after seeing Li Qiye’s demeanor: “I heard it appeared in the southwest area—”</p>
 <p>But before he could finish, Li Qiye pointed in front of him. With a buzz, he opened a portal and disappeared inside.</p>
 <p>His sudden departure left Buzhan Feng speechless since he couldn’t even say goodbye.</p>
 <p>At this time, a woman with a supreme appearance appeared by the door. This was a beauty that would cause others to be lost in admiration.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng asked after seeing the woman: “Sis, you are finally here, are you not angry anymore?”</p>
 <p>“He is a guest, after all. It would be very rude if I don’t receive him at all after several days.” Her voice was very pleasant.</p>
 <p>Buzhan Feng shrugged and said: “You’re one step too late, Sis. Brother Li has left already.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1229: Skeletal Horse</b></p>
 <p>The Dragon Demon Sea was one of the three great oceans of the Heaven Spirit World. As for why it had this name, this remained a mystery for future generations.</p>
 <p>However, one particular legend was very popular. It stated that in an era too ancient to trace, there was a demon dragon with heaven-defying power.</p>
 <p>This demon dragon eventually evolved into a true dragon. It wanted to fight against the nine heavens but ultimately failed. In the moment of its death, it fell into a great ocean and, from then on, that ocean was named the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>Most people considered this as mere gossip for tea shops since no one could verify it. No one would go to research it either.</p>
 <p>There was a more reliable theory for this name. It believed that because sea demons ruled this sea and since dragons were the leaders of the sea demons, this area took on the name “Dragon Demon Sea”.</p>
 <p>This sea was quite vast with countless creatures and sects.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, if the Abyss Sea was the world of the charming spirits and the Jade Sea was the world of the treants, then this region belonged to the sea demons.</p>
 <p>There were many powerful demon lineages here. For example, behemoths like the Seven Martial Pavilion or the Roaring Conch were the strongest.</p>
 <p>Today, this region was quite lively since many people were gossiping at various restaurants about a particular matter.</p>
 <p>A skeletal horse appeared out of nowhere and moved at extreme speeds. There were plenty of bizarre occurrences in the Heaven Spirit World, so a skeletal horse alone was not worthy of attention. The issue was its great speed. Many people tried to catch it to no avail. A sea demon at the God-Monarch level personally took action and still failed to keep up. Thus, the excitement built up as more and more were unable to catch the horse.</p>
 <p>The cultivators couldn’t help but talk about it. Some believed that it had escaped from the Bonesea. In their eyes, only that place would be able to produce such a steed.</p>
 <p>However, there were those who had a different opinion about it. For generations, no skeleton has been able to escape from the Bonesea. Thus, this particular theory was too difficult to believe.</p>
 <p>However, if this was indeed the case, then the other question would be about the new and sudden changes at the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>A blue ocean and blue sky with fish leaping out of the shallow surface while eagles soared high above. The breeze blew by, carrying a faint scent of saltwater. This was surprisingly pleasant.</p>
 <p>“Clok, clok, clok…” A crisp and rhythmic galloping broke this tranquil scene as a skeletal horse traveled on the sea's surface.</p>
 <p>However, it was way too fast. Ordinary people couldn’t see it at all, only its dark afterimage was visible.</p>
 <p>Only those strong enough would be able to see its appearance. There was no flesh left on its pitch black skeleton, as if it was dyed to this color. Each bone emitted a black mist that formed long lines when it sped faster. The result was something like a landscape painting.</p>
 <p>Despite its current dreadful appearance, judging by its build, it was definitely wonderful when it was still alive. Even calling it a divine steed would not be enough.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” A portal opened and Li Qiye walked out. He stood in the sky, looking at the horse running across the sea. A terrifying glint shot out from his eyes.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye uttered to himself: “What is that girl looking for? To even awaken the mount of Immortal Emperor Bu Si...”</p>
 <p>The girl he was referring to was Su Yonghuang.</p>
 <p>He smiled and transformed into another person. It was an unbelievably dashing youth that wore a gray robe. His body was shrouded by a gray mist, giving off an unfathomable appearance just like a bottomless abyss.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” His inner physique emerged. In this split second, he pushed the Soaring Immortal Physique to the limit and soared outside with incomparable speed.</p>
 <p>The skeletal horse galloped through the sea. Not long after, it saw a young man shrouded in a gray mist standing on the sea.</p>
 <p>It immediately stopped in front of the youth. Despite how fast it was going, not one drop of water was splashed.</p>
 <p>The youth smiled and rubbed its skull: “I have just been reborn yet you have found me already.”</p>
 <p>“Neighh!” It raised its front hooves and cheered with great excitement. After neighing, it intimately shoved its head under the palm of the young man.</p>
 <p>However, just a moment later, a red light flashed in its empty eye sockets. With a long cry, both of its front legs kicked forward at the young man with lightning speed without holding anything back.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The youth was instantly blown away and plowed a deep trench on the sea's surface.</p>
 <p>“Neighh!” The horse let out an intimidating cry before galloping into the sky, disappearing once again.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The youth jumped out of the sea. He shook his head and returned to his true form. This was Li Qiye, of course.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked towards the direction of the horse and slowly said: “Incredible, luckily I came prepared or I would have become meat paste under its hooves.”</p>
 <p>Earlier, he took the appearance of the young Immortal Emperor Bu Si in order to trick the horse. In the beginning, it was indeed successful. Alas, the horse was a divine item, so it saw through the disguise.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye murmured: “Bu Si, what did you leave behind back then?!”</p>
 <p>According to legend, the emperor could be reborn again and again. But in the end, he was the only emperor known by the entire world to have collapsed, the only one whose final whereabouts were clear. [1. This is not counting Ta Kong in this world.]</p>
 <p>No one knew why he collapsed back then during his generation. No one believed that such a day would come. Back then, he could be resurrected again and again due to his grasp of his undying art, definitively proving that he was unkillable. However, someone with the title of undying still collapsed in the end!</p>
 <p>“Interesting, I’d like to see what you left behind.” Li Qiye jumped to the sky again and casually pointed in front of him to make another portal. He teleported to chase after the horse again.</p>
 <p>For other people, not to mention catching it, just keeping up with it was more difficult than reaching the heavens. However, Li Qiye trained in both the Soaring Immortal Physique and the Space Scripture, so it was quite easy for him to catch up.</p>
 <p>While the horse bolted below, Li Qiye leisurely followed it from the sky. It knew that Li Qiye was on its tail, but it didn’t seem to care and continued on the same trajectory.</p>
 <p>After all, it was the mount of an Immortal Emperor and had power matching that position. It didn’t care if someone was chasing it.</p>
 <p>Along the way, the spectators continued to be dumbfounded since they could only see a shadow flying by. After several more days, the horse finally made it to its destination.</p>
 <p>A mountain range was situated above the sea. Each peak was wrapped in a blue reflection due to its geographical location. Many of them were shrouded in mist, so no one could catch a glimpse of its true appearance.</p>
 <p>Such a grand mountain range stretched across the sea. From a distance, it looked like a huge dragon occupying this sea region. It was a very magnificent scene that made other people realize their own insignificance.</p>
 <p>Flying in the sky, Li Qiye saw it from far away. He murmured: “Giant Dragon Mountain Range. So many years have passed, yet the scenery remains without the slightest change.”</p>
 <p>He was lost in reminiscence, with many events of the past flashing by. Memories buried deep in his mind resurfaced one after another.</p>
 <p>The smiles and sounds of the past were vivid, as if he was suddenly back there. All of the happy scenes seemed to have happened just yesterday.</p>
 <p>“Crash!” While Li Qiye was in a daze, the skeletal horse quickly dove into the depths of the sea.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1230: Dongting Lake</b></p>
 <p>If the Giant Dragon Mountain Range resembled a beast entrenched in the sea, then Dongting Lake was a jewel in the beast’s mouth. [1. Dongting is a real lake so I kept the pinyin. Literal name is "Grotto Court Lake".]</p>
 <p>As a lake within an ocean, it could be considered a miracle. Moreover, the water here was different from the water of the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>The lake was surrounded by undulating mountains that formed a circle. There were still blue waves within the lake. The islands in the vicinity were quite beautiful as well.</p>
 <p>Dongting Lake was both the name of this region and the name of a lineage.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, if the Exquisite Valley was the largest human lineage and Peacock Land was its largest diaspora, then Dongting Lake would be the human race's third largest base and its second-biggest lineage.</p>
 <p>According to legend, the lake was established by several powerful sages of the human race. Even now, it was quite populated and held considerable influence.</p>
 <p>Of course, it couldn’t compare to the Exquisite Valley, but it was still an ideal home for humans.</p>
 <p>There was a difference between the lake and Peacock Land. Humans at Peacock Land were unrestrained, but this wasn’t the case for those at the lake. If they weren’t disciples of the lake, then both cultivators and mortals must accept the management of the sect in order to stay.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, land was a precious commodity. A place like Dongting Lake was even more precious. It had plenty of space and was close to the dragon mountain as well as Rainbow City. More importantly, it was rich with various kinds of treasures.</p>
 <p>The mountains nearby were full of spirit vegetation. The lake itself also produced many rare treasures. There were rumors of a spring below the lake with plenty of divine metals and ores.</p>
 <p>In principle, the people in the Heaven Spirit World would always desire any location with land. This was especially true for a treasure land like Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>In the Dragon Demon Sea, the sea clans were extremely powerful with untouchable authorities! But strangely enough, no one tried to take over a wonderful location like Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>One could say that Dongting Lake was as powerful as a sect. After all, it was considered a great power at the Heaven Spirit World. However, it was inferior to an imperial lineage or a sea god’s sect.</p>
 <p>Ordinary great powers wouldn’t be able to eat the fat piece of meat that is the lake, but unparalleled lineages like the Seven Martial Pavilion and the Roaring Conch were definitely capable. Strangely enough, they didn’t touch the lake. It was something worth musing.</p>
 <p>Various theories arose about the reason the lake was able to exist until now. Some believed that the sect itself was strong enough and the location was easy to defend while hard to attack. Another theory was that the pavilion and conch didn’t care for the lake.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was not anxious to catch up to the horse that had snuck into the sea. He had left behind his mark so he could chase it at any time. Various emotions resurfaced in his mind after seeing the jewel of the ocean — Dongting Lake. Eventually, he landed on the lake and took a stroll.</p>
 <p>He went up to one of the islands and decided to walk barefoot through the soft sand to feel the land. There was an indescribable sensation of comfort as well as a great sense of remembrance.</p>
 <p>There were eighteen different forts at the lake, each with their own beautiful sceneries such as the resplendent sun shining down on the lake’s surface that was as blue as jade… There were plenty of such locations in this area.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye’s favorite was the “thousand carps playing in the water”. He enjoyed watching this pretty scene the most.</p>
 <p>Because of this, he came to this particular bay and prepared a large bowl of bait. Stomping on the sand while looking at the blue lake granted him serenity and satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” He grabbed a lot of bait and scattered it into the lake. One carp after another immediately began to appear. They surfaced to seize the bait floating on the surface of the water.</p>
 <p>As he threw in more bait, more carps came out to play. The sound of splashing water continuously resounded.</p>
 <p>Clusters of fish were now here vying for the food. Beads of water splashed and were illuminated by the bright sun. These carp came in all types and colors. Some were purple while others were a scintillating gold…</p>
 <p>The myriad colors twinkled under the sun. These lights interwove with the waves and created little rainbows that were extremely beautiful.</p>
 <p>After throwing out all the bait, he simply sat on the sand-laden bay to watch the carps. He relished every second and seemed to forget about everything. The past was no more, his worries carried away by the wind while everything else disappeared like clouds and smoke.</p>
 <p>Eventually, all the bait was consumed and the carps dispersed. The crashing ripples calmed as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>There was a grin on his face as he rested his legs in the refreshing water of the lake.</p>
 <p>At this time, he had traveled through space and time to a distant era when he did the exact same thing. Soaking in the lake offered him a rare sense of invigoration. Some carps curiously swam over.</p>
 <p>One would feel that everything happens for a reason. Thinking of this, Li Qiye began to smile. There were too many memories in life, but very few moments of happiness. However, just this little amount was precious enough.</p>
 <p>Water suddenly splashed with crashing waves, breaking the tranquility of the bay.</p>
 <p>“Hey, where is your label?” Li Qiye was woken up by this call. He looked forward and saw a ship approaching him.</p>
 <p>It was a medium-sized warship wrapped in armor with a very sharp look. A middle-aged man was standing at the bow. Just one glance was enough to tell that he was a human cultivator. His robe had a sandy color and was embroidered with the insignia of Dongting Lake, letting others know that he was its disciple.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slightly frowned and asked: “Label, what label?”</p>
 <p>“Anyone who comes to Dongting Lake must register with us to be given a label. Otherwise, they must disclose their identity.” The middle-aged man lowered his tone.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily replied with a carefree expression: “Is that so? There’s no need to ask me for this label or whatever, return from whence you came.”</p>
 <p>“You!” The man felt provoked by Li Qiye’s attitude. He glared at him, wanting to get off the ship to question him.</p>
 <p>However, before he could get down, someone stopped him. It was a woman who said: “Supervisor Yu, leave it to me.”</p>
 <p>Her voice was very clear and soft, yet also had a hint of directness and boldness.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man coldly stared at Li Qiye then snorted before going back inside the ship.</p>
 <p>“May I ask for your name?” She looked at him and calmly said: “I am Hong Yujiao, a disciple of Dongting Lake. Patrolling the lake is our responsibility.”</p>
 <p>This woman was very beautiful. Even though she was not as kingdom-toppling as Zhuo Jianshi’s bunch, she had her own style and wore a tight bluish-green dress. It wrapped her body and revealed all the curves of her figure. Her towering soft breasts were plump enough to accentuate her slender waist. Such an outfit seemed like it was built for someone who often dives into the water.</p>
 <p>She had a little makeup on her face, making her even more charming. Her willowy brows carried both a touch of femininity and a hint of tenacity. Her spirited pair of round and large eyes were bright, giving off a sharp and determined sensation.</p>
 <p>Despite not being a kingdom-toppling beauty, her firm and resolute demeanor made her quite attractive. This was a woman with a straightforward style.</p>
 <p>“Surname Hong?” Li Qiye raised his brows and looked at her.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am Hong Yujiao. May I ask for your name and where you are from?” She cupped her fists decisively like a man would. This was a woman who wouldn’t concede to men. [2. This particular idiom is difficult to keep the raw form. However, it is definitely praising a woman despite the discriminatory origin/nature of the phrase in ancient China. The raw is, “a headdress (woman) won’t yield to beard and brows (man). Back in ancient times, women were called “headdresses” and men were called “beard and brows”. These are literary terms used when the author wants to exaggerate the masculine and feminine aspects of the respective sexes, often in a positive manner, but it can be derogatory as well.]</p>
 <p>In fact, claiming herself as a disciple was a very modest way to put it. The Hong Clan had an exceedingly pivotal status at Dongting Lake. Their clan had always been a pillar of this location.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye closed his eyes, showing his lack of interest: “I am only a passerby. Where I’m from and what my name is are not important.”</p>
 <p>She calmly replied: “Sir, I hope you can understand that this is for the safety of the lake. We require everyone to register with us. Please be considerate.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1231: Hundred-Saints Hall</b></p>
 <p>“Dongting Lake now…” After hearing this, Li Qiye glanced at Hong Yujiao and shook his head disapprovingly: “This once all-accommodating land of treasures has lost the model crafted by the old wise sages. It no longer has the same temperament in its attempt to vie for power.”</p>
 <p>After hearing such words, Hong Yujiao’s heart skipped a beat. She wasn’t too clear on the meaning of his emotional statement.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye dazedly stared at the barely visible islands scattered across the lake. He eventually calmed down and stared at her to speak with a dismissive tone: “I am only here for a bit and will leave soon. Don’t worry about me.”</p>
 <p>She looked back at him and cupped her fists to say: “If Fellow Daoist will leave soon, then I won’t bother you any longer. However, if you want to stay here for more than one day, I hope that you will cooperate with us by filing and receiving a label. If you have any questions, feel free to find me anytime.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and lied down on the sand to watch the blue sky and white clouds without a care for others.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao took another look at this ordinary and strange fella. Eventually, she refrained from commenting and let her people steer the ship away.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye softly sighed again. Dongting Lake was indeed a nice place. In the past, several wise sages established this location as a starting point for the humans to have a strong backing in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>These sages were very broad-minded; they were oceans that could shelter a hundred streams. Because of this, the lake was once more powerful than the Exquisite Valley.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, prosperity came and a desire for profits and gains arose. Not just anyone could be so magnanimous and altruistic like these sages; their descendants didn’t share the same attitude. When they eventually gained power, they couldn’t escape the temptation of having even more.</p>
 <p>“This lake used to be so wonderful...” Li Qiye was slightly disappointed: “Alas, its descendants have fallen short.”</p>
 <p>He dispelled these thoughts from his mind since he was enjoying a rare moment of peace.</p>
 <p>Time continued to pass like the quiet white clouds gently drifting in the sky, something that nobody would pay attention to.</p>
 <p>No one knows how long he had been lying on the sand for. Suddenly, his mind shifted after feeling a summons and immediately opened his eyes. In a split second, he leaped into the sky and rushed out of the lake.</p>
 <p>The Giant Dragon Mountain Range was more than just a ring of mountains surrounding Dongting Lake. Many islets were right outside, and the majority of them already had owners. These islets scattered outside the lake were like thrown out pearls.</p>
 <p>One of these islets in particular was quite large. Many old pavilions and buildings were built on it, though most had collapsed and were invaded by thickets of weeds.</p>
 <p>It was a desolate location. Only a few buildings at the very top of the island remained intact. These buildings were built around an ancient temple.</p>
 <p>The temple was very old. The whole structure seemed to have stemmed from one solid piece. The gray walls appeared to have been carved out of a single gigantic stone.</p>
 <p>An old plaque was hung above the old temple. It appeared to be made out of bronze yet wasn't bronze, iron but not iron, wood but not wood. Who knows what it was made from?</p>
 <p>The plaque had been through many years and looked like time had polished away all traces of what was written on this plaque. Nevertheless, one could still see three faintly visible words engraved on it — Hundred-Saints Hall.</p>
 <p>These words were etched with an archaic style, so only the knowledgeable would be able to recognize them. The three words had suffered the battering of time for too long, so they became quite blurred. One could almost see stars lingering around them, as if they contained a portion of a vast universe.</p>
 <p>If someone with good insight took an even more careful look, they would find something else. It looked like there was indeed a celestial system and a universe around them. Within this universe was a great army, an invincible cavalry that was stationed here.</p>
 <p>However, they were too tiny, especially for those with weaker vision. Everything was placed around these three words. There was also a figure. Upon careful examination, one would find a crow carved above these three words. When it spread its wings, the crow shielded the words as if it was granting them its protection.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” At this time, sounds of violence could be heard. A young man holding a giant hammer was fiercely smashing the doors to the ancient temple. Alas, it didn’t matter how hard he slammed down, he couldn't break open the doors even though they were made out of wood.</p>
 <p>An old man that looked nearly fifty shouted: “Stop!” He wore gray clothing and had distinct facial features, but his body was thin and feeble. One could see that he was a cultivator, but his blood energy was incredibly weak, indicating his shallow cultivation.</p>
 <p>The old man shouted to stop the young man, but before he could do anything, five other burly men stopped and immobilized him.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The youth mercilessly smashed the door, but it still wouldn’t open.</p>
 <p>He had a pair of hawk-like eyes while his back was covered with armored fish scales. The five men holding down the old men had the same scales.</p>
 <p>This was a big race in the Heaven Spirit World. The scales were the defining characteristic of the Ironscale School, a fish tribe among the sea demons. They barely meet the qualifications to be considered a big race with their nest being around one thousand miles away from the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. The ideal nests for them were deep in trenches.</p>
 <p>The youth was the young lord of the Ironscale School, Lei Yu. He wanted to establish a stronghold outside of his school and had chosen this island.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the only descendant of the Hundred-Saints Hall was this old man. He didn’t want to sell the island, leading to this conflict.</p>
 <p>“Old geezer, didn’t you say your hall was protected by the sacred sages of the nine heavens and ten earths? Where are they now?” Lei Yu looked at the captured old man and laughed boisterously.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that the old man’s cultivation was too weak. He simply was not a match for the muscular men.</p>
 <p>He struggled but was pushed down again. Alas, he was unyielding and lifted up his head to declare: “I will not sell off the Hundred-Saints Hall even if it means my death!”</p>
 <p>“If you don’t want to sell it, then I might as well smash it apart!” Lei Yu turned cruel and glared at the ancient temple.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” More explosions could be heard, but he still couldn’t break open the temple no matter how hard he tried.</p>
 <p>He mustered all of his strength like a baby drinking its mother’s milk, but it was all for naught. He became quite angry and decided to take it out on this old man by mercilessly stomping on him.</p>
 <p>“Old geezer, I have plenty of time. Today, I’ll torture you to death and my school will take its time breaking down this place. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you quickly, not until I flatten this land. I want to see the despair in your eyes!” With that, he unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks on the old man.</p>
 <p>The youth was livid. He originally wanted to break this temple down first before forcing the sale. However, he simply couldn’t destroy this building at all; this only provoked his greed to possess this place. He believed that there was definitely an incredible treasure on this island, perhaps inside the temple.</p>
 <p>He became even more determined to occupy this island before others caught wind of it.</p>
 <p>The old man was quite stubborn. Despite vomiting blood from Lei Yu’s barrage, he still kept his head high without letting out a single groan.</p>
 <p>“Old geezer, your bones are quite hard, yeah?” Lei Yu sneered and stomped on him again; a crisp crack made it apparent that a bone snapped.</p>
 <p>The old man finally grunted. He was clearly in deep pain, but he didn’t let out a full scream.</p>
 <p>“Heh, geezer Zhang, no matter how hard your bones are, I can still kill you as easily as killing an ant. Beg for your saints to come and save you. Where are they now?”</p>
 <p>The old man still didn’t utter a word and spent all of his energy on keeping his head high. His unyielding attitude only further enraged Lei Yu.</p>
 <p>Lei Yu stomped on the old man’s face and sneered: “Hahaha, tell these saints protecting your temple to appear already so that I can see what these so-called saints of the nine heavens and ten earths look like!”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” A chilling voice sounded at this time: “Do you really wish to see the saints of the nine heavens and ten earths?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye landed in front of the temple with a frigid demeanor and glared at Lei Yu’s group.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1232: Zhang Baitu</b></p>
 <p>Lei Yu and his robust followers couldn’t contain their laughter after seeing an ordinary human like Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Lei Yu mocked: “Boy, what now? You want to stand up for your fellow race? But before doing that, you need to weigh yourself—”</p>
 <p>“Boom!” But before he could finish his spiel, his five followers were rendered into pulp, their blood staining the stone slabs on the ground.</p>
 <p>These men didn’t even know how or why they died. They couldn’t even react before being crushed completely.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Lei Yu started seeing stars. Li Qiye had one foot on his body, so he couldn’t move at all.</p>
 <p>The previously captured old man was also frightened out of his mind. He stared at Li Qiye in disbelief since he couldn’t even see part of the process.</p>
 <p>His followers being annihilated as well as his lack of ability to retaliate while being trampled upon made Lei Yu’s soul leave his body.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chillingly spoke: “No one is allowed to defile the Hundred-Saints Hall!”</p>
 <p>Lei Yu shouted: “Little, little boy… do you, you know who I am? I am the young lord of the Ironscale School and my father is the schoolmaster. If, if you dare to hurt me, my father will not only kill you, he’ll annihilate the entire hall as well…!” He was quite afraid, so he had to bring up his father.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” Bones were broken, causing him to scream. Li Qiye had crushed his face with a stomp. Flesh and blood went flying as Lei Yu writhed in agony.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye emotionlessly declared: “I am sparing your dog life so that you can tell your father to personally cut off your head and bring it here as an apology. His failure in teaching you will also result in his decapitation as well. If he heeds my words, then I shall spare your Ironscale School. Otherwise they will not see tomorrow’s sun!”</p>
 <p>With that, Li Qiye lifted his foot from Lei Yu and kicked him off the island before saying: “Scram.”</p>
 <p>Lei Yu was kicked into the ocean and pissed his pants from fear. He immediately dived down and escaped out of sight.</p>
 <p>The old man was still in shock and couldn’t stand up from the ground. Li Qiye gently sighed while looking at the old man before helping him up.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked: “What is your name?”</p>
 <p>The old man took a while before answering: “My, my surname is Zhang. Everyone calls me Baitu.” Having said that, he felt quite dejected despite his stubborn nature. However, his head was still held up high the entire time.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lamented while looking at him: “Why did the descendants of the Zhang Clan fall to this level?”</p>
 <p>The stubborn demeanor of the old man reminded him of someone.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye threw a medicine bottle over to Zhang Baitu and said: “You are badly hurt, so take this.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu accepted the bottle and poured a pill into his palm. His heart jumped after seeing the shining golden hue. He looked over at Li Qiye in astonishment. Despite his lack of knowledge, he still knew that this piece of medicine was a big deal.</p>
 <p>“Take it.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve as he didn’t want to waste more words.</p>
 <p>After a short silence, the old man quietly took the medicine.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood before the temple and looked at the old plaque that was hung up high, gazing at the crow engraved above the three words “Hundred-Saints Hall”. He stood there, silently looking at this plaque for a long time.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he looked back at the old man and asked: “Aren’t clans like the Zhang and Hong responsible for taking turns to protect the hall?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was surprised to see a human junior aware of this matter. He eventually replied: “My ancestors accepted the responsibility of protecting this place.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Li Qiye nodded: “I understand. Your ancestors lost the conflict for power at Dongting Lake back then and had to move out, correct?”</p>
 <p>“How, how do you know that?” Zhang Baitu was surprised. Even the elite disciples of the lake didn’t know about the power struggle of their ancestors.</p>
 <p>“For power, even blood brothers can become enemies, let alone mere friends.” Li Qiye stated without answering the question. He sighed once more while looking at the plaque.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu eventually calmed down and bowed towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble, how should I address you?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye answered: “Li Qiye, just a passerby.”</p>
 <p>He didn’t have a big reaction after hearing this name and only nodded. He was only a little character and hadn’t heard of Li Qiye’s name before.</p>
 <p>“Squeak—” Li Qiye pushed open the wooden doors to the hall. Lei Yu used all of his strength to desperately smash open these doors to no avail, yet Li Qiye opened them so easily.</p>
 <p>“How, how can this be!” The old man couldn’t believe his own wide-open eyes.</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Li Qiye turned back at him.</p>
 <p>“Because, because these doors have never been opened by anyone.” Zhang Baitu was stammering. In his memories, no one had been able to open these doors. His seniors and even many big shots from Dongting Lake all failed.</p>
 <p>According to the legends, the hall was protected by the wise saints of the world; their power safeguarded this hall.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t reply as he stepped inside. The astounded old man calmed down and quickly followed.</p>
 <p>He had to ask: “Young Noble Li, are, are you one of the saints?”</p>
 <p>The unopened doors had been opened by Li Qiye, so perhaps this was one of the legendary saints.</p>
 <p>“Saint? Are you referring to the saints that protect the hall?” Li Qiye laughed and said: “If you believe so, then I can be considered one.”</p>
 <p>With that, he went inside. This hall was very simple without any further decorations other than a stone pillar. Contrary to people’s expectations, the end of the hall contained no treasures. There was only a line of memorial tablets with names engraved on them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was caught in a long silence while looking at these all-too familiar names. He began to bow in front of each one while feeling quite sentimental inside.</p>
 <p>This was Zhang Baitu’s first time seeing these tablets and names. However, the majority of them had the surname Zhang, Hong, or Xu.</p>
 <p>After a while, he quietly asked Li Qiye: “Are these, are these the tablets of my ancestors?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Qiye softly nodded: “They are the wise sages of the human race, the pride of humanity. Even during the era of darkness, they continued to defend the dignity of our race and protected its final dawn.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu had no comments. He didn’t know anything about his ancestors. Only he remained of the Zhang Clan, and he rarely mingled with Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, the descendants did not inherit the ambition or beliefs of their ancestors. After so many generations of friendship, they still couldn’t avoid the temptation of one thing — power.” Li Qiye bemoaned while looking at the tablets.</p>
 <p>The ancestors of the Zhang, Hong, and Xu were friends for generations. Their clans all followed Li Qiye, and they eventually settled down in this place, creating Dongting Lake. It was meant to be a shelter for the human race in the Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>The lake was once a prominent power. In its heyday, even the Exquisite Valley was far from being comparable.</p>
 <p>Regrettably, the descendants of these friends betrayed each other later on. They fought for power to the point of life and death.</p>
 <p>Because of this, Li Qiye didn’t want to bother with the lake’s unfilial mindset or power struggles.</p>
 <p>After a long time, he withdrew his gaze and glanced over at Zhang Baitu, flatly stating: “Even if your Zhang Clan lost the fight back then, it shouldn’t have deteriorated to this state.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and responded: “I don’t know much about the ancestors’ business. I heard that after leaving the lake, they decided to stay here and act as guards. It is we descendants who were useless and failed to pass on our lineage. By the time my father’s generation arrived, we were already finished. During my youth, my father and uncles departed one after another, unable to maintain the inheritance. In the end, I could only learn a few superficial things.”</p>
 <p>In the past, the three clans ruled the lake together. Later on, the Zhang Clan lost the internal conflict. Their ancestors were stubborn as well, so after losing, they moved out of the lake and settled here.</p>
 <p>Because their clan had lost a lot of resources, it was sent into a nosedive; each generation became worse than the previous.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1233: Zhang Clan</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye came out of the hall and sat on a stone step to gaze at the vast sea and its unrestrained waves while the soft breeze blew. This went on quietly for some time.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn’t know Li Qiye’s origin. In his eyes, the youth was too mysterious and simply impossible to speculate.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu couldn’t help but ask: “Young Noble, where did you come from?”</p>
 <p>“From where I should.” Li Qiye looked over at Zhang Baitu and said: “I see that your cultivation is needlessly complex and unrefined. There’s your own clan’s merit law, then there are the incantations from the sea demons and internal strengthening from the treants. This is very chaotic, so your blood energy isn’t flowing well.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was surprised after hearing this. Li Qiye being able to see through him despite being so young made him feel quite dejected.</p>
 <p>“After the seniors left, I couldn’t learn a lot beyond the elementary basics, so I had to go outside to find teachers. I joined many sects but failed to make much progress and had to return to the Hundred-Saints Hall in hopes of being able to live the rest of my life here like a falling leaf returning to its roots.” A great sadness was expressed by his eyes; there were too many words he wanted to say, but he kept it brief.</p>
 <p>So it turned out that after the seniors of his clan passed away, he couldn’t learn the remaining merit laws as they were missing.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t willing to give up, so he left his home to find masters. Who knows if it was due to his own inability or some other reasons? Either way, this search didn’t go smoothly.</p>
 <p>In this process, he learned very slowly, and the same went for his cultivation. In fact, “very slow” wasn’t enough to describe his cultivation, “as slow as a snail’s pace” was a more appropriate analogy.</p>
 <p>It was slow to the point where the sects he had joined agreed to let him leave. Sometimes he even left of his own volition.</p>
 <p>For many sects, there was no leaving after joining. However, there was no cure for Zhang Baitu’s cultivation speed. To put it bluntly, even if he didn’t want to leave, they would want him to leave eventually. Having such a disciple was simply losing face.</p>
 <p>Just like this, he joined one sect after another but amounted to nothing. He eventually joined too many sects in the Dragon Demon Sea and became quite well-known. Everyone called him Zhang Baitu. It referred to him being the disciple of too many sects. No one even remembered his real name. [1. Baitu = Hundred-Disciple.]</p>
 <p>In the end, he helplessly spoke with a dejected expression: “It is because I am too stupid and have an inferior constitution. I have let down my masters and seniors; I’m even weaker than a new disciple even after a lifetime of cultivation.”</p>
 <p>He lamented with a sigh after saying this and felt despair. In the beginning, he thought that it was because he didn’t have a suitable merit law or a teacher. As time went on and he suffered many successive failures, he lost all confidence and began to consider himself stupid and unsuitable for cultivation. So in this way, he returned to his home, the Hundred-Saints Hall, to live out the rest of his life.</p>
 <p>He mumbled to himself: “Maybe I was not meant to be a part of this world. I was born a mortal, why the need to enter the cultivation world?”</p>
 <p>After joining so many sects and cultivating so many laws, he couldn't blame anyone but himself.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and lightly said: “It is not that your constitution and talents are lacking nor is it due to your stupidity. All things in life have a cause and effect. It is just that you haven’t found your own karma yet.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu smiled bitterly and replied: “There’s no need to comfort me, Young Noble. Some seniors have told me the same thing. If it really isn’t due to my own constitution, then why haven’t I made a half-step of progress?”</p>
 <p>From his perspective, Li Qiye was only comforting him with the same words he had heard many times before from the nice seniors of the other sects.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly shook his head: “A child of the Zhang Clan is different after all. It will be fine if you cultivate your clan’s merit law.”</p>
 <p>“Our own merit law?” Zhang Baitu’s surprise quickly turned into curiosity as he asked: “Young Noble, do you know our clan’s merit law?”</p>
 <p>In fact, he was very interested because Li Qiye was able to open the wooden doors of the hall, something that no one else had ever done before. Thus, he suspected that Li Qiye was a legendary saint.</p>
 <p>Of course, he didn’t know what a saint or sage was. They were only figures of the old tales after all. Despite all the rumors about the Hundred-Saints Hall being protected by the wise sages of the nine heavens and ten earths, the descendants of the three clans had never seen any of them before.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye faintly smiled and replied: “If you want your clan’s lost merit laws, then just go back to Dongting Lake. In the past, the Hong, Zhang, and Xu Clans should have had some treasures. Perhaps you can find your laws there.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu slightly opened his mouth but ultimately refrained from saying anything and only sighed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked: “Could it be that Dongting Lake has been snubbing your Zhang Clan?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu paused for a moment before answering: “I don’t know much about the business of the elders, but the lake does care about me. They don’t try to push me away.”</p>
 <p>“It is you who doesn’t want to go back.” Li Qiye understood his pride right away.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn’t answer.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye went on: “Let the past disappear. Your ancestors’ power struggle is ancient history. The Xu, Hong, and Zhang Clans once fought together; friends to the death, friends on the battlefield. They never gave up on each other even in the most brutal of times. Even if it was blood for blood, they would still support each other to live on…</p>
 <p>“As the descendants, all of you are indeed unworthy. Excluding each other just for a little power using treachery and deceit — this is simply throwing away all your ancestors’ face and tarnishing their great friendships.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped for a moment at this point: “After so many years, those who competed for power are probably no longer there. It is time for you all to come back and mutually support each other as a big, interdependent family again. Only in this way will your Dongting Lake be able to survive in the future.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye would rarely give out advice in such a well-meaningful manner to outsiders. This was indicative of his respect for the ancestors of the three clans.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu had no response. As a descendant, he wasn’t in a position to comment on his ancestors’ business. Perhaps he was feeling a bit resentful as well.</p>
 <p>“The people from the Zhang Clan are always a bit too proud.” Li Qiye just smiled since he understood Zhang Baitu’s feelings.</p>
 <p>He continued on: “You might be angry and unhappy with the Hong Clan pushing your ancestors away from Dongting Lake. The Zhang Clan was one of the founding families, so this feeling of indignation is unavoidable.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.” Zhang Baitu spoke: “Dongting Lake has no ill-will towards me, as far as my generation is concerned. I don’t know much about the conflicts back then, only that after leaving, my ancestors didn’t want to return to the lake. They settled here instead, and this has been our home ever since.”</p>
 <p>“A thousand years of anger… it is time to let it go.” Li Qiye only grinned. He didn’t know much about the power grab between these descendants since he couldn’t bother finding out about this rotten business.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, he still hoped that these descendants could come together some day. These clans used to coexist and not one piece could be missing. Only through unity would the lake be able to survive in the future.</p>
 <p>“When I was younger, this resentment was more or less already there.” Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and sighed: “But now, I am closer to the earth than the sky, so I don’t care too much about unnecessary things. All of this no longer matters. The enmity between the ancestors, just let it go; right and wrong is already in the past.” [2. Closer to the earth than the sky means close to death.]</p>
 <p>After personally uttering these words, he felt quite relaxed. The enmity between their clans should disperse like smoke.</p>
 <p>During those years, their Zhang Clan was pushed away from the central power of the lake. Their ancestors furiously moved out and decided to guard the Hundred-Saints Hall instead and cut all ties with the lake. Because of this, the Zhang descendants harbored resentment for many generations and didn’t want anything to do with the Hong and Xu Clans.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at the old man and said: “It is good to think this way. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. One day, you will be able to laugh while thinking of these old grudges.”</p>
 <p>“Crash!” At this time, the water started to splash violently as more than one hundred Ironscale cultivators rode the waves to come closer.</p>
 <p>“Not good, the Ironscale Schoolmaster is here in person.” Zhang Baitu’s expression quickly changed after seeing these wave-riding experts. He didn’t think that the school would come so fast. Moreover, the schoolmaster and the elders came in person.</p>
 <p></p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1234: Old Plaque</b></p>
 <p>More than one hundred experts from the Ironscale School as mighty as tigers and wolves were riding the waves forward. In the blink of an eye, they climbed up to the Hundred-Saints Hall. Their leader was an old man whose back had an armor suffused with a golden glow. This was a special characteristic of the Ironscale Tribe after they reached a certain power level.</p>
 <p>This leader turned out to be the Ironscale Schoolmaster, Lei Yu’s father.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu turned pale after seeing so many experts from this school. Even though he was a seasoned man who had seen a lot of the world, he still shuddered in fear before such powerful enemies.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu calmed down and hurriedly told Li Qiye: “Young Noble, leave quickly. Two hands cannot win against four fists. As long as the verdant hills remain, there is no fear of lacking firewood.”</p>
 <p>Despite his shallow cultivation, he could still tell that Li Qiye was powerful. However, the school had more than one hundred experts, Li Qiye alone would find it difficult to oppose them.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry.” Li Qiye sat on the stone steps and smiled: “The unrepentant must pay a huge price.”</p>
 <p>The Ironscale Schoolmaster and his fellow experts came before the temple. They saw Li Qiye sitting on top of a stone step without a care. Lei Yu’s expression became twisted as he pointed at Li Qiye and yelled: “Are you the one who killed my disciples and harmed my son?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at him and smiled: “That’s right. Are you going to cut off your son’s head as well as your own to beg for forgiveness before the Hundred-Saints Hall now?”</p>
 <p>“A fool knows no fear. Still daring to boast? My Ironscale School will tear you into pieces. And as for you, old man, this is on your head as well.” Lei Yu screamed with eyes spewing a fiery fury. As a descendant of a big sect, he had never been humiliated like this before.</p>
 <p>“Beg for forgiveness towards the hall?” The schoolmaster couldn’t help but laugh: “What the hell is this place that justifies my school begging for forgiveness? You have already committed an unforgivable sin, I shall take your head and offer it to my disciples so that they can watch from the heavens…”</p>
 <p>“... as for you, Old Zhang.” The schoolmaster’s eyes turned cold as he spoke imposingly: “You sold this island to my school and took our money, yet you dare to renege on it? A crime worthy of death. Today, I will take this island in accordance to the agreement and crush the Hundred-Saints Hall.”</p>
 <p>“Liar!” Zhang Baitu jumped out after hearing this and pointed at the schoolmaster: “Since, since when did I sell this island to your school?! This is simply coercion!”</p>
 <p>“Is that right?” The schoolmaster sneered and took out a contract: “It is clearly written as such on this contract. I trust that in just a moment, your fingerprint will be on it on top of an oath with your true fate.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu trembled from anger. He knew what the school wanted to do, so he snapped: “Lei, don’t even think about it! I would commit suicide before letting you succeed! This island will forever belong to my clan, you won’t be able to take it!”</p>
 <p>“Really now?” The schoolmaster smiled deviously: “I’m afraid your Zhang Clan is about to meet its end, do you still think the island will belong to the clan then?”</p>
 <p>“You…” Zhang Baitu was quivering with rage and could no longer speak.</p>
 <p>“To tell the truth, I’m a bit disappointed with you sea demons.” Li Qiye lazily stood up at this time: “It has been too long and you demons have such bad memories. Perhaps you all have forgotten who you can and cannot afford to provoke. It looks like I need to stain this place with blood as a reminder that this is the Hundred-Saints Hall, its holiness is inviolable and protected by the sages of the nine heavens and ten earths! Violators shall be killed without mercy!” With that, his eyes shot out a chilling murderous intent.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, protected by the sages!” Lei Yu couldn’t help but laugh with a cruel grimace: “Where are they now? Are you one of them? Haha, a junior like you dares to call yourself a sage? Hahaha, inviolable holiness? Our Ironscale School will trample this place and build another branch here!”</p>
 <p>After Lei Yu finished speaking, Li Qiye suddenly appeared in front of him and spread out his palm to grab Lei Yu’s head.</p>
 <p>“What, what are you doing?!” Lei Yu was stunned from shock and wanted to run towards his father. However, it was too late.</p>
 <p>“Rip!” His head and his spine were instantly pulled out by Li Qiye as blood spattered everywhere.</p>
 <p>“No...” His head was still moving as he screamed before his imminent death.</p>
 <p>“Little beast!” The schoolmaster couldn’t save his son in time and had to watch the process play out. He vomited blood from anger and cried in a furor: “Kill him! Tear him into pieces!”</p>
 <p>He himself took out a saber and rushed forward.</p>
 <p>“Junior, accept your death!” At this time, the elders and the other experts shouted aggressively. All of them wanted to kill Li Qiye with their numerical advantage.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Bursts of impacts resounded, followed by the sound of bones shattering. Next came the sounds of objects falling to the ground.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster and all of the experts fell to the ground at the same time like a flower in full bloom.</p>
 <p>Blood quietly flowed from their bodies and soaked the ground and stone pavement. All of this happened in complete silence.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster’s eyes were wide open. Not even in death did he know how he died. Li Qiye was too fast, they didn’t even have the opportunity to react.</p>
 <p>“What…” Zhang Baitu struggled to calm down. He was quivering with fear and stumbled several steps backward. Even though he had seen killing before, this was his first time seeing such a brutal massacre.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye once again sat down on the stone steps as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“Hang them all on the trees.” He commanded nonchalantly: “Let the world know that the Hundred-Saints Hall is the resting place of brave spirits. No one can violate its sanctity. Some people should start remembering better!”</p>
 <p>“This, this is not good, the Ironscale School will go mad.” Zhang Baitu hesitated and said: “This isn’t only provoking the school, it will be going against the entire Sea Demon Race.”</p>
 <p>“You just need to listen.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “The Ironscale School and sea demons are meaningless. If the overlords of this race understand the significance of the Hundred-Saints Hall, they will tuck their tails between their legs!”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu paused for a bit before following Li Qiye’s directions and started to hang the bodies on the trees. Doing so in the most conspicuous location was truly sending a message to their enemies.</p>
 <p>After taking care of business, he returned to Li Qiye’s side and asked: “What now?”</p>
 <p>“What else but to destroy the Ironscale School? I stay true to my words!” Li Qiye smiled and stood up to look at the plaque of the temple.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The crow on the plaque seemed to come alive. It suddenly opened its eyes while the plaque shot out an endless light. In an instant, the plaque flew away with the momentum of an invincible cavalry.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” A violent world-destroying aura instantly rushed out. It broke through the void and emerged in the sky above the Ironscale School.</p>
 <p>“What’s happening?” The ancestors there were confused after sensing this invincible aura engulf their school.</p>
 <p>“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic explosions occurred. The plaque underwent a great change, as if it was a gigantic armored deity descending from the sky.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The earth shook while an impossibly high tidal wave rose to the sky. The entirety of the Dragon Demon Sea was affected by the tremors.</p>
 <p>The plaque carried the supreme will of an unstoppable cavalry and instantly penetrated the ancestral ground of the Ironscale School. Despite the multi-layered defensive barriers, the ancestral ground couldn’t withstand a single blow and was immediately annihilated.</p>
 <p>“No!” The ancestors couldn’t help but scream after seeing the destruction of their ancestral ground. It was too late. With just one attack, the Ironscale School completely collapsed as the blood of its disciples stained the sea.</p>
 <p>Many people felt this change and were astonished. Dongting Lake was the closest sect. It was alarmed as well, but no one knew what was going on.</p>
 <p>The invincible will of a cavalry had crossed through the heaven and earth, causing countless creatures to tremble.</p>
 <p>This commotion had startled a few truly supreme existence. In the highest location of Rainbow City, one person among the clouds suddenly stood up in shock. Their eyes illuminated the world.</p>
 <p>“Which blind fool maneuvered against the Hundred-Saints Hall!” This person was moved by this development: “That is the place protected by the sages, so which idiot decided to blaspheme the brave spirits? That is simply courting death.”</p>
 <p>Other sects and lineages didn’t know what was going on. It was only after a long time that these few ancient existences finally calmed down.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1235: Minor Zen School</b></p>
 <p>After a long time, an ancient existence who actually knew about what happened movingly spoke: “The Hundred-Saints Hall is the untouchable resting place of heroes. A few fools do not know and only think of it and Dongting Lake as a treasure land worth coveting. Why don’t they think about the reason it has been untouched for millions of years? Whatever, just a few fools wanting to die. My old bones do not want to join such muddy waters.”</p>
 <p>After commenting, this existence went back to sleep and ignored this matter completely.</p>
 <p>Back on the island, the plaque returned to the top of the temple. It was still incomparably old like before.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu had fallen to his knees from the pressure emanating from the invincible aura. It took him a long time to calm down. Nevertheless, he was still stunned. Not even in his dreams would he have thought that this old plaque of the hall carried such power.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he stood up and looked at it while stammering: “This, this thing is…”</p>
 <p>He took half a day, yet he couldn’t enunciate a whole sentence clearly. [1. Half a day is an expression, he didn’t actually stammer for 12 hours.]</p>
 <p>“You still don’t understand? The wise sages protecting the hall does not refer to me.” Li Qiye flatly said: “They are the spirits of the Zhang, Xu, and Hong Clans, answering the call once more.”</p>
 <p>“Spirits?” Zhang Baitu was dazed for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Your ancestors were benevolent, broad-minded, and brave. They were not the most powerful of their generation, but many Godkings still admired them. This was not because of their achievements or strength, but because of their magnanimous and pious minds on top of being very loyal. These characteristics are worthy of admiration, as precious as gold and jade.” With that, he looked at Zhang Baitu and continued: “But as for their unfilial descendants, look at what they have done. Turning on each other for petty power, cutting off all ties. When your ancestors stood at the peak to look down on the world, they still didn't think about competing for power! How can you all not be ashamed with them watching you from above?!”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was unable to calm down. He imagined the scenes when the three clans struggled together. He saw them in one camp, not abandoning each other even in the face of death…</p>
 <p>“You will follow me for now.” Li Qiye commanded: “Go tidy up your belongings, I will go on ahead. Wait for me in Rainbow City.”</p>
 <p>After issuing the command, he pointed at the air and created a portal, leaving instantly.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhang Baitu stood there absentmindedly. After a long time, he eventually calmed down yet still felt like this was a dream before going to pack his things.</p>
 <p>There were many islands outside of Dongting Lake. Of course, they couldn’t compare to the lake whether in size or resources.</p>
 <p>Among them, the Minor Zen School could be considered a powerful lineage with five islands. Their entire ancestral ground was built on these five landmasses.</p>
 <p>The Minor Zen School was fairly far from Dongting Lake. It was established by humans as well and only consisted of humans cultivators. This gave it a bit of fame in the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>There was a guest today who specifically wanted to meet its schoolmaster. If it was any other sect, it wouldn’t be so simple to see a schoolmaster like this. After all, it was a prestigious position, not just anyone could see them.</p>
 <p>However, the Minor Zen School was a relatively small lineage. Their schoolmaster didn’t put on airs; after hearing that a young human wanted to see him, a personal reception was in order.</p>
 <p>In the room, he and the guest sat down before he finally looked at this young man. It was a very normal-looking person with no semblance of a master.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, being the leader of a small sect he trod very carefully, regardless of who he might be talking to.</p>
 <p>“May I have your name?” Eventually, he cupped his fists in greeting.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” It turned out that after leaving the hall, he went straight for the Minor Zen School.</p>
 <p>His purpose was to find out more information on Su Yonghuang.</p>
 <p>After hearing the name “Li Qiye”, the schoolmaster immediately stood up and respectfully cupped his fists again: “So it is Young Noble Li from Peacock Land. Excuse me, this lowly one has eyes yet failed to see Mt. Tai. Please forgive us.”</p>
 <p>As a leader, he had his own intelligence channels, especially regarding news that related to the human race. The story of Li Qiye sacrificing a billion Teeming Fish for the Peacock Tree had also spread to the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was satisfied with the schoolmaster’s attitude and nodded.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster didn’t expect the successor of the Peacock Tree to come to the Dragon Demon Sea. He was quite surprised and emotionally spoke: “Young Noble Li, you are the great disciple of the Peacock Tree and will be the master of Peacock Land in this generation. It looks like the human race will continue to have a sanctuary in the Heaven Spirit World.”</p>
 <p>Many people considered Li Qiye to be the tree controller or even a disciple of the Peacock Tree.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother correcting this misunderstanding. He nodded and said: “I didn’t come today for anything relating to Peacock Land. I only want to ask about a woman that has been here.”</p>
 <p>“You must be asking about Miss Su?” The schoolmaster thought about a certain person after hearing this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and nodded again: “Yes, I want to know what you gave her.”</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster trembled internally. He hesitated and spoke unwillingly: “Well, it is not that I don’t trust you, but this relates to someone else’s personal business.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I know her better than you. We are from the same sect.” Li Qiye flatly said: “But I can still make a guess even if you don’t tell me since it looks like you’re not completely human.”</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster was shocked to hear this: “What do you mean, Young Noble?”</p>
 <p>“You know what I’m talking about.” Li Qiye smilingly said: “The bloodline of the Undying Gate flows through you. Even though it is very faint, its mark is indelible. It’s only just that the bloodline marking of Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s clan would be extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>The master took several steps backward and stared at Li Qiye in horror. Outsiders shouldn’t know such things, yet Li Qiye was able to see through it with his all-piercing eyes.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster calmed down and sat back in his chair before wryly smiling: “Your insight is wonderful. This lowly one won’t hide it anymore.”</p>
 <p>He sighed and continued: “You are right, one of my female ancestors was indeed from the Undying Gate. After its decline, she married her husband here at the Dragon Demon Sea.”</p>
 <p>“She also brought some items from the Undying Gate to this place.” Li Qiye speculated. The thing he was curious about was how the ancestor from the Su Clan had a connection with the Undying Gate.</p>
 <p>“A few treasures.” The schoolmaster admitted: “But none of them are particularly incredible.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and gently shook his head: “Don’t worry, I’m not here for treasures. Plus, if I wanted treasures from the Undying Gate, I wouldn’t have come here.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, there is a misunderstanding.” The schoolmaster hurriedly smiled in response: “She brought along a few items in her dowry that have been used up long ago. If I had a world-shattering treasure, the Minor Zen School wouldn’t be a small lineage right now.”</p>
 <p>“Then what did you give Miss Su?” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
 <p>“A map.” To which the schoolmaster responded: “But it is not a treasure map or anything. It is a very strange map with no use. If it wasn’t for Miss Su bringing the other half of the map with her, I wouldn’t have known that it was half of a map in the first place. She had to have it, so she paid an exorbitant amount of refined jades for it.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye casually asked: “What kind of map is it?”</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster revealed a wry smile and said: “To tell the truth, I don’t know what kind of map it is either. It was thrown into a corner at home and no one has ever looked at it before. After Miss Su brought the other half here, I finally remembered it. After she received the other half, I also took a quick look. It is a very strange map, I couldn’t make heads or tails of it.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, it is definitely not an art for eternal life.” In the end, he added this sentence lest Li Qiye have some misunderstanding.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye burst into laughter: “I know what you mean. Rest assured, I am not here for the art of immortality. If such an item could fall into your hands so easily, countless people for the past millions of years wouldn’t have been searching for it. It’s not something you can possess.”</p>
 <p>“Your keen insight is worthy of admiration.” The schoolmaster became relieved after hearing this. He didn’t want Li Qiye to think that he once had the art of immortality.</p>
 <p>If this news were to spread, then a disaster would befall their school.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your time, goodbye.” After his inquiries, he understood that the schoolmaster had limited knowledge, so there was no need to pry further.</p>
 <p>In fact, he was not in a rush to find Su Yonghuang. As long as she wasn’t in any danger, he was fine with it. He was only curious about what she actually did to make even the skeletal horse of Immortal Emperor Bu Si start running outside.</p>
 <p>Of course, he also knew that the collapse of the Immortal Emperor back then wasn’t so simple. Otherwise, the emperor wouldn’t have left some cautionary measures.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster enthusiastically asked: “If you don’t mind, can you stay in our humble abode for a few days?” Li Qiye was the successor of the Peacock Tree. In the future, he could become a leader for the human race in the Heaven Spirit World, thus the schoolmaster wanted to befriend Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head. He glanced at the master and casually took out a wooden box: “Thank you for your hospitality. This is a greeting gift, goodbye for now.”</p>
 <p>The master was taken aback. He accepted the wooden box and whiffed a medicinal fragrance. He looked up to say: “Young Noble, you are too polite…”</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>The schoolmaster eventually calmed down and opened the wooden box. He was astounded and stumbled several steps backward while unable to believe his eyes: “One million year old Blood Ginseng!”</p>
 <p>This truly frightened him because it was just a greeting gift. How extravagant was this? It wasn’t an item he would even dare to think about.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave it to him due to his honesty. If he wasn’t someone who took pride in being a schoolmaster, Li Qiye wouldn’t have given him the gift.</p>
 <p>After the schoolmaster calmed down, he quickly put it away. Such an item could bring about a sect-ending disaster for them if others were to find out.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1236: Rainbow Island</b></p>
 <p>If Dongting Lake was a jewel before the dragon mountain, then Rainbow City was situated by the very end of its tail.</p>
 <p>The tail of the mountain range was dotted with many islands like the stars in the sky. All of them were quite small yet exquisite. The inhabitants here used the trees in the surroundings to build pretty little houses.</p>
 <p>At the mountain range and Rainbow City, people usually brought up another lineage, one that was very mysterious in the Heaven Spirit World — the Giant Dragon Kingdom.</p>
 <p>Some believed that it indeed existed while others denied this claim. Who knows the truth in this matter? According to the legends, the ancestor of the kingdom was the Giant Dragon God. The existence of this deity was widely accepted, unlike the kingdom.</p>
 <p>It was considered the apex existence of the sea demons. After dying, its huge body turned into the current Giant Dragon Mountain Range. From then on, its descendants prospered and populated this area. The kingdom was also established by them within the depths of the range.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the kingdom’s location and characteristics were still mysteries to outsiders. However, one could find some traces of this kingdom at Rainbow City. Some said that this city was a window of the Giant Dragon Kingdom. It was purposely established as an outreach towards the secular world.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Rainbow Islands were only the beginning of the city itself. One must go through the islands before being able to reach the city.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye entered one island and faintly smiled while staring at the sky. A series of islands appeared before him with people coming and going. Humans, sea demons, and treants — all of these cultivators were only stopping by for a bit before attempting to enter the actual Rainbow City.</p>
 <p>He saw a carriage going through this island. It was very extravagant and its body was made from the precious metals of the Profound Dynasty. Eight different compartments spewed out water that paved a path in the sky so that the carriage could move forward even faster.</p>
 <p>Eight of the rarest phoenix-steeds in the Heaven Spirit World were pulling this luxurious ride. Scintillating lights accompanied them and made it seem like their owner was a deity on patrol.</p>
 <p>Many pretty maids were behind the carriage while younger servants were throwing flowers next to the carriage. Wherever it was on its path, the surrounding ten miles would be filled with fluttering flowers. It was the most ostentatious showing of wealth and nobility.</p>
 <p>Not too many people would put on such an overbearing posture in the Heaven Spirit World. Most importantly, the majority of cultivators did not pursue this type of luxury, so this type of lavish travel was quite rare.</p>
 <p>It also easily attracted jealousy and even trouble from others. However, the master of this carriage probably never spared a thought for such a problem.</p>
 <p>In fact, the moment people saw the little flag on the carriage, they quickly gave way, let alone cause trouble. They knew that this was the banner of the Profound God-Monarch. Only those closest to him were allowed to use this banner.</p>
 <p>A cultivator murmured: “Gongsun Meiyu is here.”</p>
 <p>His friend reminded him: “Shh, quiet down. You better call her Queen Gongsun. I heard people from the Abyss Sea say that she likes being called queen the most. Otherwise, she might randomly kill people if she is in a bad mood.”</p>
 <p>People had different emotions while looking at this luxurious carriage. Some were awed while others were envious, but regardless of what they felt the most common reaction was to retreat.</p>
 <p>Gongsun Meiyu was a concubine of the Profound God-Monarch and was known to have earned his favor. Rumor has it that she might even be promoted from concubine to wife, the new queen of the Profound Dynasty.</p>
 <p>In fact, she didn’t only rely on her beauty to win his love. Before marrying him, she had already been famous among the younger generation of charming spirits. Her cultivation was very powerful as she was once a prodigy.</p>
 <p>Someone speculated: “If Queen Gongsun is here, maybe the monarch is on his way as well?”</p>
 <p>His companion quietly replied: “Don’t speak carelessly. I heard Queen Gongsun is very grumpy right now. Her favorite maid was killed by a kid named Li Qiye. She is probably on a trip to feel better, or maybe she is trying to find that kid.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored the carriage. He entered an inn and quietly drank, waiting for Zhang Baitu to come.</p>
 <p>He quietly sighed while gazing outside the inn to look at the ocean as well as the faint dragon mountain range in the distance.</p>
 <p>In fact, many resting cultivators were gazing at it as well.</p>
 <p>A cultivator asked his friend sitting next to him: “Are there really dragons in those mountains? Or rather, does such a race truly exist in this world?”</p>
 <p>An older elder pondered for a moment regarding this question before answering: “That would depend on how you define the dragon race. Whether they exist in those mountains or not is difficult to say. However, dragon demons indeed exist in the Heaven Spirit World. They are supreme among our Sea Demon Race. Some ancestors believe that the dragons in there are part of the sea dragon demons as well.”</p>
 <p>“Speaking of dragons, I have heard of a certain legend.” A friend at the same table added: “A very long time ago, a little black dragon used to play around these mountains and this sea region. It swam through the Rainbow Islands, but who knows if it is real or not.”</p>
 <p>Another friend happily joined in: “I’ve heard about that too. This little black dragon caused a lot of trouble at Dongting Lake. Later on, it was subdued by an immortal.”</p>
 <p>The cultivator that initiated the conversation became quite curious and quickly asked: “Immortal? A real immortal?”</p>
 <p>“It’s probably just a fairy tale. Where can you find immortals in this world?” The elder smiled and shook his head.</p>
 <p>One of the friends added: “I heard a version that is a little different. It says that the person who subdued the little black dragon was not an immortal at all, it was a heinous devil king. After this devil king took down the dragon, he skinned it and drank its blood before boiling the meat and eating it.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, who was sitting in a corner, almost spat out his wine. Some rumors kept on spreading and eventually, the tale became completely different.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t really mind this small talk. He gently smiled and stopped listening.</p>
 <p>After a good while, Zhang Baitu finally arrived. He saw Li Qiye and quickly bowed. Li Qiye nodded and signaled for him to sit down.</p>
 <p>“You are late.” Li Qiye casually spoke while drinking and enjoying the scenery outside.</p>
 <p>“Something happened that slowed me down a bit, just a small matter.” Zhang Baitu smiled awkwardly while rubbing his palms.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slightly frowned and asked: “Someone came looking for trouble?”</p>
 <p>“No, no—” Zhang Baitu saw Li Qiye’s expression and his soul almost left his body. He quickly waved his hands to deny the claim.</p>
 <p>But how could a little character like him withstand Li Qiye’s glare? He eventually gave up with a bitter face: “Young Noble, really, it is no big deal. Because of the big commotion earlier, the disciples from Dongting Lake were afraid that something had happened to me, so they came asking questions, that’s all. They really didn’t trouble me at all, really.”</p>
 <p>In his eyes, Li Qiye was definitely not a good-natured person. A single discordant conversation could lead to a bloodbath. He probably belonged to the type of people who would kill as many provokers as possible. Because of this, he was afraid that Li Qiye would misunderstand and kill the disciples from the lake. He would never be able to forgive himself if that were to happen.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave him a quick glance before shifting his gaze towards the mountains.</p>
 <p>After seeing Li Qiye no longer pressing the issue, Zhang Baitu finally felt relieved. He thought about back then when the disciples saw the corpses that were hung on the trees. How could they not be frightened?</p>
 <p>Of course, he didn’t want these disciples to provoke Li Qiye, it would be the same as courting death.</p>
 <p>He eventually gathered his courage and softly asked: “Young, Young Noble, where are we going now?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and replied: “To Rainbow City to grab a few things for you. We have to prepare certain things in order to destroy your dao foundation and start over.”</p>
 <p>“Destroy my dao foundation?” The old man was startled after hearing this. Even though his foundation was very shallow, it was still the fruit of several dozen hard-fought years. He couldn’t accept this so quickly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him with one eye and said: “There is nothing to feel lost about. I’m not trying to belittle you, but your dao foundation is as good as not having anything at all — it’s completely dispensable. Destroy to rebuild from the beginning — this is the way to go.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu had to admit that his foundation was indeed lacking and dispensable.</p>
 <p>He asked with some concern: “But I’m not young anymore, can I handle it?” He was quite old already. Destroying the foundation at his age could easily lead to exhaustion, he’d croak for sure.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye casually replied: “Don’t worry. With me here, it would be difficult for you to die even if you wanted to.”</p>
 <p>“Then we’ll do as you say, Young Noble.” He made a decision after a moment of hesitation. In his eyes, Li Qiye had no need to harm him. If he did, just one finger was enough to take care of him, there was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1237: Hong Yujiao</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave a nod and continued to look at the hazy mountain range in silence.</p>
 <p>This Giant Dragon Mountain Range stretched for ten million miles like a dragon lying on the ocean. It was completely engulfed in mist and fog; a dragon with a visible head yet indiscernible tail. This made the whole area even more mysterious. [1. This idiom was used before and is slightly modified here. It means magnificent/unfathomable.]</p>
 <p>Unwittingly, his vision of the mountains turned a bit hazy during this long observation. Who knows if it was his eyes becoming blurry or the mountain range itself losing definition?</p>
 <p>He became absent-minded for a long time. Some unwanted memories resurfaced and his heart jumped as if it was being clutched by something.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu quietly sat there and didn’t say anything after noticing Li Qiye’s intense stare.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble.” Eventually, Li Qiye’s expression became very strange, prompting him to ask: “Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was startled and regained his wits. He gently sighed and lightly replied: “It’s nothing. It is only that the mountain range is too incredible. A few things from there are truly unforgettable.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu misunderstood him and scratched his head while agreeing: “Right, this mountain range has always been incredibly enchanting. It is extremely mysterious, so it invokes curiosity from just about anyone. They all want to know if the Giant Dragon Kingdom truly exists or not…”</p>
 <p>“... But no one has ever been able to verify this. According to legend, unless they were granted permission from the kingdom, no one would be able to get in there. There have been many attempts to enter it, but none were publicly successful. Do you want to go there for a look too?” He thought that Li Qiye wanted to enter the mountain range, but Li Qiye was actually thinking about something else.</p>
 <p>“Maybe.” Li Qiye only smiled and casually asked: “How is the Jian Clan right now?”</p>
 <p>“Are you referring to the Jian Clan from Rainbow City?” Despite being a nobody, Zhang Baitu still knew a few things about Rainbow City due to how close it was.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded. His mind was a little unfocused.</p>
 <p>“The Jian Clan is still doing very well in Rainbow City. Everyone says that they are the number one clan there.” Zhang Baitu told Li Qiye everything he knew: “I heard they are very close with the human race. Some also say that they are related to the Giant Dragon Kingdom. It is a relatively low-key clan, but we all know just how powerful they are. The Jian Clanmaster has lived for several thousand years, but he is still as vigorous as ever.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye remained impassive after hearing this, but he was sighing on the inside. The brat from the Jian Clan was still alive. Unfortunately, he didn’t want to face it…</p>
 <p>The Heaven Spirit World was not a place that he wanted to visit either. There were many memories that he preferred to be forgotten.</p>
 <p>During his silence, a woman wearing a tight green outfit arrived outside the inn. Her curvy figure contrasted her cold and determined demeanor. This was Hong Yujiao who met Li Qiye back at Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was surprised to see her. Meanwhile, she immediately came over when she saw him and cupped her fists: “Senior Brother Zhang, long time no see.”</p>
 <p>Although Zhang Baitu was not a disciple of the lake, in accordance with their ancestors’ hierarchy, Hong Yujiao still needed to call him senior brother.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Sister Hong, long time no see. Your cultivation has increased yet again.” Zhang Baitu smiled wryly and turned away with the intention of blocking Li Qiye from her view. He didn’t want her to see Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He was not worried for Li Qiye but rather Hong Yujiao’s safety because he could faintly guess why she came to this place.</p>
 <p>It was of no use because she had spotted Li Qiye and spoke with a hint of surprise: “It’s you?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was still contemplating while looking at the mountain range, so he didn’t hear her.</p>
 <p>She didn’t like his attitude, but this was not Dongting Lake. She didn’t want to make it difficult for him since she came for Zhang Baitu.</p>
 <p>As for Zhang Baitu, he lamented in his mind. He knew that this was unavoidable and only wished for Hong Yujiao to mind her words.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I was entrusted by my father to ask you about a few things.” She sat down and looked at him in a serious manner.</p>
 <p>Her father was the current Dongting Lakemaster, Hong Tianzhu.</p>
 <p>“About what?” He asked quickly, despite knowing full well what she wanted to talk about. This was the matter he didn’t want her to mention the most.</p>
 <p>She said: “I heard some news about people from the Ironscale School coming to cause trouble for you.”</p>
 <p>True to his expectations, he tried to divert the subject: “Oh, about that? It’s over now. They wanted to buy my Hundred-Saints Hall, but how could I sell the ancestors’ home? So I said no.”</p>
 <p>She softly said: “What happened on the island then? Brother, this is no small matter.” This was not an attempt to blame or interrogate him, she needed to know the truth of this big event.</p>
 <p>Out of nowhere, a divine aura suppressed the entire Demon Dragon Sea. Next, news of the destruction of the Ironscale School spread. A bit later, Dongting Lake found out that the corpses of the Ironscale Schoolmaster and more than one hundred of his followers were hanging at the Hundred-Saints Hall. How could the lake not be startled by this?</p>
 <p>Of course, they didn’t connect the aura that destroyed the Ironscale School with the hall. However, it was still a big deal when those corpses were located on that island. After all, their lake was a prime suspect to these deaths.</p>
 <p>In fact, after finding out, they disposed of those bodies. Zhang Baitu didn’t dare to let Li Qiye know since he was afraid that Li Qiye would become angry and make his way in to destroy the lake.</p>
 <p>“Well…” Zhang Baitu didn’t know how to respond. He was not someone who was good at lying, so he coughed and said: “Well, the responsibility does not fall on us. It was the Ironscale School forcing a sale.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and slowly said: “Why make such a big deal out of something so trivial like destroying an Ironscale School?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was alarmed. He was not worried about himself, he was afraid that Hong Yujiao would provoke Li Qiye. His shallow cultivation did not blind his vision, he knew that Hong Yujiao had learned the arts of her father, but she was nothing before Li Qiye. She would be crushed by just one of his fingers.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao’s expression changed as she looked at Li Qiye with a stern look and asked: “May I have your name?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu wanted to say something, but he refrained from doing so. Li Qiye looked back at her and smiled: “My name doesn’t matter. I just want to say that your Dongting Lake is becoming worse with each successive generation, losing sight of the grand picture just for petty gains in power.”</p>
 <p>He laughed and continued: “Look at your lake now. Unlike your ancestors who protected the vitality of the human race, you’re now just a bunch of cowards hiding in the city. All of their glory has been thrown away by your generation.”</p>
 <p>“Today, you have even forgotten about the souls of your ancestors as well as your spiritual totem. I’m curious, how many years has it been since the last time your lake went to worship the Hundred-Saints Hall? Has it been fifty or a hundred generations? I’m afraid that your lake has even forgotten who the ones enshrined in the hall are.” With that, he sighed and didn’t want to look at her anymore.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t answer due to lacking knowledge about this matter. She only knew that some ancestors from the lake speculated that the Hundred-Saints Hall might be storing some treasures.</p>
 <p>“We descendants are not qualified to comment on the matter of our ancestors.” Eventually, she answered: “I just want to ask you, did you kill the Ironscale Schoolmaster’s group?”</p>
 <p>This was the thing she was most concerned about. After all, the schoolmaster and elders of a sea demon lineage had died very close to Dongting Lake, and even their sect was destroyed. Once this news spread, their lake would become the prime suspect.</p>
 <p>Of course, she understood that Zhang Baitu couldn’t kill that group, so the only possibility was this person sitting in front of her.</p>
 <p>“I understand your lake’s intention.” Li Qiye smiled: “It needs to find a murderer in order to wash away this suspicion.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1238: Scolding</b></p>
 <p>She maintained her calm despite his accusation and lowered her tone: “This is a serious matter, so our Dongting Lake will get to the very bottom of it.”</p>
 <p>“Get to the bottom of it?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “When the Ironscale School bullied Zhang Baitu, when they tried to force him to sell the Hundred-Saints Hall, where was your lake then? And now, during the aftermath, your lake is trying to steer clear of anything to do with this event. Quite interesting…”</p>
 <p>“Well…” Zhang Baitu softly spoke: “Young Noble, this really isn’t the lake’s fault. I didn’t tell them at all.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and waved his sleeve: “You don’t have to speak up for them, I know full well what is going on. You don’t have to tell me that the lake has disposed of the bodies either.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Zhang Baitu was scared. He didn’t expect Li Qiye to predict it this fast, so he had no response.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao answered instead: “Brother Zhang is not at fault, this was the lake’s decision and it has nothing to do with him.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Li Qiye slowly turned towards Hong Yujiao and smiled: “This is more like it, spoken like a family.”</p>
 <p>She took a deep breath and stared at him: “With all due respect, this is not a joke, I hope you can clarify this matter or the sea demons in this region will put this on Dongting Lake. At that time, the lake will be isolated from the rest of the world.”</p>
 <p>“Isolated from the world?” Li Qiye laughed: ”This kind of thing will never happen. Kill thirty to fifty of someone’s men and they will swear to never share this sky with you again. But if you kill a billion of them, they will obediently tuck their tails between their legs. Those who are unconvinced will have their bones litter the ground!”</p>
 <p>His eyes turned cold at this point: “I am not someone who agrees with using force to bully the weak, and I will not condone any immoral acts from my followers. However, those who dare to provoke me or harm my followers, regardless of whether they are strong or weak, will be killed before talking about who was right and wrong! Only when you use blood to talk will others understand where your bottom line is. Otherwise, people will think that you are an easy target, and they will bully you while thinking that the humans in the Heaven Spirit World are mere ants.”</p>
 <p>“It is a pity that your group did not inherit the hot blood of your ancestors or their willingness to kill!” He continued on with indifference: “Your lake is willing to sacrifice Zhang Baitu to separate itself from this situation, maybe you would even give up the Hundred-Saints Hall altogether. As long as the interests of your lake are untouched, everything can be negotiated.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu trembled after hearing the line about killing all those who opposed you and answering with blood. It truly touched his heart.</p>
 <p>“We do not have those intentions.” Despite being unable to refute all of Li Qiye’s accusations, Hong Yujiao still said: “We don’t want to turn Brother Zhang into a shield, our goal is to find out the truth so that others won’t misconstrue the situation.”</p>
 <p>“Misconstrue?” Li Qiye laughed sarcastically and said: “So what if they misunderstand? The Ironscale School and outsiders are nothing. Who needs them to understand things clearly? So what if they don’t? You can’t even protect the spirits of your ancestors and have even forgotten their creed, yet you care about the misunderstandings of outsiders? The damned geezers at Dongting Lake have lost their minds!”</p>
 <p>“Sir, I hope you can be more careful with your words. Dongting Lake has our own principles, and we shall do what we must.” She didn’t back down in response: “We are grateful for you saving Brother Zhang, but if you keep on insulting Dongting Lake, don’t blame me for no longer being polite!”</p>
 <p>“Sister—” Zhang Baitu jumped up from his chair and dragged her away: “Sister, you now understand the situation so go back and report this to the sect master.” He winked at her.</p>
 <p>He didn’t want to see a fight between the two of them since her fate would be the same as the ones from the Ironscale School — instantly crushed by Li Qiye!</p>
 <p>“Baitu—” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “There’s no need to be so sneaky around me. If I wanted to kill her, she wouldn’t have been able to talk in front of me. The same goes for Dongting Lake; if I wanted to trouble them, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu awkwardly let go of her and wryly smiled: “Young Noble, she isn’t trying to annoy you. She is only nervous about protecting Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>“If I was annoyed with her, I wouldn’t have let her speak.” Li Qiye glared at him. The old man coughed and didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shifted his attention towards the girl and said: “I’m the killer, your lake can go ahead and reveal it if you want to be rid of suspicion. Tell those brainless geezers to stop being short-sighted all day long and fixated on trivial matters. They have forgotten who their ancestors are and their own surnames for a few benefits!”</p>
 <p>“You…” She glared at him. After all, he was directly scolding her elders. No one could swallow such anger.</p>
 <p>“Sister, go already, the master is waiting for your news.” Zhang Baitu dragged her away and motioned for her to quickly leave.</p>
 <p>She managed to restrain herself and coldly looked at Li Qiye: “I won’t interfere with your disrespectful behavior, but if you insult Dongting Lake again, I will definitely deal with you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored her and focused on his drinks.</p>
 <p>She eventually left, brewing with indignation. If it wasn’t for Zhang Baitu pulling her back, she would have definitely fought this arrogant person!</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was in a difficult position after she left. He rubbed his palms and smiled: “Young Noble, Sister Hong is a very good person. The only thing is that she can be very straightforward at times.”</p>
 <p>Even though their ancestors had grievances, this generation got along with each other. This was especially true for Hong Yujiao and himself. They were quite close, so he couldn’t watch her go to her death. Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye looked at the faint mountain range one last time and decided to pay the bill. He looked over at Zhang Baitu and said: “Come, we’ll go to Rainbow City.”</p>
 <p>The two of them left the inn to go to the ferry. Everyone had to use this particular type of fish as transportation before they could reach Rainbow City.</p>
 <p>Once they got to the ferry, the sky suddenly turned dark. A gigantic ship descended from the sky, its size too immense to describe. Half of its hull was still hidden in the clouds, so no one could see it fully.</p>
 <p>This gigantic warship appearing at Rainbow Island attracted a lot of attention.</p>
 <p>Many people saw the conch insignia on the warship and became quite surprised. Someone asked: “Is that the Roaring Conch?”</p>
 <p>An old man slowly answered: “No, this isn’t it. It might be the ship of a big character from there though.”</p>
 <p>Another person speculated after seeing the ship: “Is it the Seashield Prince then?”</p>
 <p>The insignia of the Roaring Conch left many spectators shocked. This was a famous lineage throughout the entire Heaven Spirit World, not just limited to the Dragon Demon Sea. They had two sea gods that possessed the Trident for a very long time. According to the tales, the moment their conch blared, all of the sea demons in the world would answer its call.</p>
 <p>A smaller ship flew out of the big warship. In fact, this smaller vessel was still quite sizable. It just seemed tiny in comparison to its huge friend.</p>
 <p>The warship didn’t stop after the second one came out. It slowly rose to the sky and disappeared towards the horizon, towards an unknown destination.</p>
 <p>The smaller one landed. Many saw a woman standing at the bow. She basked in the wind with her hair fluttering about.</p>
 <p>Her pretty eyes and nose were more than enough to describe her as beautiful. Her fair white skin had a hint of rouge. Such a beauty would command attention wherever she went. Her waist was especially slender; it was as if a gust of wind could make it dance.</p>
 <p>Despite her delicate appearance, she exuded a terrifying aura befitting of a God-Monarch! Halos emerged from her body. Each of them seemed to be part of their own world while carrying infinite power.</p>
 <p>Many were frightened to see this force. After all, she was an incredibly young God-Monarch.</p>
 <p>“Wow, a God-Monarch…” Zhang Baitu was in awe and felt quite envious after seeing the God-Monarch’s halos.</p>
 <p>He had cultivated for a lifetime, yet his cultivation was completely negligible. However, this young lady ahead was already a horrifying God-Monarch. How could people not be stunned into admiration before this scene?</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1239: Rainbow Fish</b></p>
 <p>In fact, Zhang Baitu was not the only one who was envious. Many people had the same stunned expression while looking at her.</p>
 <p>“Shangguan Feiyan, the junior sister of the Seashield Prince. Rumor has it that she is already an Intermediate God-Monarch, what a magnificent goddess.” A young cultivator stared at her in admiration but became gloomy when comparing himself to her.</p>
 <p>God-Monarch was only a title. In fact, experts at the Virtuous Deity level were eligible to be called God-Monarchs.</p>
 <p>There were different levels of this particular title. Cultivators generally divided them into five levels: Minor Monarch, Intermediate Monarch, Grand Monarch, True Monarch, and Bestowed Monarch. [1. Note, they are all God-Monarch in the raw, but that makes it even longer and these titles will be repeated a lot, so I’m removing the God part for now unless the text requires it to make sense.]</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a need to explain the levels of Minor, Intermediate, and Grand Monarchs. In fact, some God-Monarchs from the previous generations didn’t think that these levels were necessary. Some even held them in contempt and thought that these three levels only consisted of false God-Monarchs. This was because although they had reached the level of Virtuous Deity, they couldn’t understand the true profundities of this realm.</p>
 <p>Of course, a few called themselves “God-Monarch” even before reaching the Virtuous Deity realm. These were the real pretenders.</p>
 <p>True Monarch, for many people, was the true baseline of this realm. Individuals of this realm not only understood the mysteries of the Virtuous Deity realm, they could also create their own kingdom and climb up the divine investiture platform to accept the blood energy of their citizens.</p>
 <p>For the older experts, only True Monarchs could exert the real power of this realm and were eligible to fight against the world itself.</p>
 <p>As for Bestowed Monarchs, needless to say, these were the top existences among the Virtuous Deities. They were normally bestowed the title by an Immortal Emperor and have gone on expeditions around the nine worlds. This was the type to have experienced countless baptisms of blood and sharpening from battlefields.</p>
 <p>Even though real experts looked down on the first three levels and considered them fake, Shangguan Feiyan was still an Intermediate Monarch at such a young age, so she was powerful and impressive enough.</p>
 <p>“The Roaring Conch is worthy of being one of the strongest sea demon lineages. They have more than just the Seashield Prince among the younger generation, there’s Shangguan Feiyan as well.” A sect master was amazed to see her.</p>
 <p>She was a young genius from the Roaring Conch with great aptitudes. She knew that there was still quite a gap between her and her senior brother, the Seashield Prince, so she chose the path of the grand era instead. She was determined to become a top Godking instead of competing for the heaven’s path with her senior brother.</p>
 <p>At this time, many people were lined up for the ferry to go to Rainbow City. After arriving, Shangguan Feiyan didn’t try to cut the line and stood there just like everyone else.</p>
 <p>“The two of you, eh? It will be ten Ancient Saint Jades for each.” An old man standing by the entrance saw two extravagantly dressed young men and named the price. It looked like these two were from great powers.</p>
 <p>This old man was the only person watching over the entrance. He wore a gray robe and had an ordinary appearance; nothing particularly stood out.</p>
 <p>One of the two youths wasn’t happy to hear this, so he complained: “Ten Ancient Saint Jades for each person is too outrageous. That person earlier heading for Dragonwell City only paid a single Heaven’s Mandate Jade. We are going to Dragonhark City, yet you are asking for ten Ancient Saint Jades? What kind of tolls are these? I know that Dragonwell is the first stop and Dragonhark is the second stop, but why is this second stop ridiculously more expensive than the first?” The youth was very indignant. They came from a great power and had great statuses, so they weren’t lambs to be slaughtered.</p>
 <p>The old man was unmoved. He didn’t bother to even look at them as he arrogantly said: “I’ll collect the fees how I see fit. If you don’t like it, don’t come to Rainbow City.”</p>
 <p>He had an unperturbed demeanor, as if he didn’t mind other people coming to cause trouble.</p>
 <p>The youth’s friend immediately pulled his sleeve and whispered: “This is the rule of Rainbow City, the fees are arbitrary without a clear criterion.”</p>
 <p>“Are the two of you coming or not? Scram to the side if you aren’t, don’t get in the way of the people behind you.” The old man impolitely waved his hand as if he was swatting flies away.</p>
 <p>The friend immediately placed refined jades into the old man’s hand and hastily said: “We’re going, we’re going.”</p>
 <p>The old man whistled. With a splashing sound, two rainbow fish jumped out from the water. He waved his hand again at the two youths: “Go on.”</p>
 <p>This so-called ferry was, in fact, a large well. It had clear water with no bottom in sight. Who knew how deep this well actually was?</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the rainbow fish resembled gigantic goldfish. The main difference was that they also had a tail with seven colors.</p>
 <p>The youths quickly jumped on the fish. With a pop, the two fish each spat out a large bubble. The youths began to fly with these bubbles and disappeared right away. This was the way to Dragonhark City.</p>
 <p>The old man said: “Next.”</p>
 <p>Another boarded the ferry and busily stated: “I want to go to Dragonhark City as well.”</p>
 <p>The old man glanced at him and replied: “Three Inner Longevity Jades.”</p>
 <p>The person immediately paid the fee without complaint and the old man called for another rainbow fish to take him away.</p>
 <p>Cultivators boarded the ferry of Rainbow City one after another. This old man’s pricing had no standard at all. He asked for however much he wanted while the people wanting to reach the end of Rainbow City obediently paid the price.</p>
 <p>No one dared to cause trouble. There had been tales of people trying to fight against members of Rainbow City being thrown away very far. Among them, one person needed to fly several hundred years before returning to their home.</p>
 <p>After a good while, it was finally time for Shangguan Feiyan’s ship. She stood at the bow and said: “The entire ship to Dragonhark.”</p>
 <p>“The whole ship?” He looked at the ship and began to count with his fingers: “A ship of this size requires one hundred rainbow fish. There will be a fee added for labor as well as an entry fee to the city, docking fee and protection fee…”</p>
 <p>The old man counted a whole bunch of fees and went all out: “30,000 Prosperous Era Paragon Jades.”</p>
 <p>Many people were tongue-tied after hearing this price. This was practically extortion. The majority would never be able to earn this many jades in their entire lifetime. Even a great power wouldn’t necessarily be willing to pay so much to enter the city.</p>
 <p>However, she came from the wealthy Roaring Conch; she handed the payment over to the old man without batting an eye.</p>
 <p>He whistled again and one hundred rainbow fish emerged. He commanded: “Go.”</p>
 <p>The fish immediately pulled the ship away. To see this many fish drag away such a huge ship with their bubbles was quite a spectacular scene.</p>
 <p>More time passed, it was finally Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu’s turn. Baitu was only following Li Qiye since he didn’t know which station they were going to.</p>
 <p>“Dragonhark.” Li Qiye smiled while looking at the old man.</p>
 <p>“You? Free.” The old man looked at Zhang Baitu and then turned to look at Li Qiye: “And as for you, thirty Virtuous Paragon Jades.”</p>
 <p>“We, we’re together.” Zhang Baitu was anxious for Li Qiye after hearing the price. In his eyes, thirty Virtuous Paragon Jades was an astronomical figure! He wouldn’t be able to gather this much in his entire life.</p>
 <p>“30.” The old man didn’t care at all; it was as if he didn’t hear Zhang Baitu.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and handed a black pouch over to the old man. The old man didn’t bother looking at it before putting it away in his chest pocket, then he whistled for two fish.</p>
 <p>The two jumped on the fish as they blew their bubbles and disappeared. By the time the bubbles disappeared, allowing the two to see again, they had already fallen into a huge ancient city. This was their destination, Dragonhark.</p>
 <p>Dragonhark was the first stop of Rainbow City. In fact, Rainbow City was only a general term, it didn’t mean that it only consisted of one city. On the contrary, it was the general designation for everything here, including these cities and stops.</p>
 <p>Many believed that Rainbow City gained its name because all of these stops required the riding of the Rainbow Fish’s bubbles to reach them.</p>
 <p>Rumor has it that Dragonhark City was named after Dragonhark Valley. The validity of this claim remains unknown.</p>
 <p>Dragonhark City was enormous. While standing on the city walls to look outside, people would see blossoming white clouds. This city seemed to be built in the sky. While looking down, one would only see a vast expanse with no end.</p>
 <p>Even while inside the city, people didn’t know where it was located. This has always been a hot topic with great discussions and studies. However, the answer remains a mystery.</p>
 <p>There were stories of people jumping down from the wall in order to locate where Dragonhark actually was, but there would be no return after jumping down. From then on, no one from future generations dared to jump down the wall unless they were tired of living.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu jumped off their fish, and the fish swam away with their tails flapping about.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1240: Destroying The Dao Foundation</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye brought Zhang Baitu straight to the Rainbow Pavilion in Dragonhark. They reserved a small courtyard and settled down.</p>
 <p>The Rainbow Pavilion was the biggest inn at Dragonhark. In fact, it was the only one in Dragonhark and all of Rainbow City as well.</p>
 <p>No one knew why there was only one inn in the entire region. Some believed that the inn belonged to Rainbow City and that they didn’t wish to share this business with outsiders. Others stated that behind the inn stood the Jian Clan. This clan had a very deep relationship with Rainbow City.</p>
 <p>Despite being the only inn here, the pricing was very reasonable and it could accommodate more than ten thousand guests. Because of this, there were no complaints from outsiders upon visiting the inn.</p>
 <p>After taking care of Zhang Baitu, Li Qiye went out to buy some medicinal materials. When he passed by the lobby, he heard a shopkeeper advertising to the guests: “Fair to the young and old with the right price, we have eighty million years of reputation!”</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper was an old man around the mortal age of seventy with a gray robe. His appearance was not too outstanding, but he was very hardworking, evident by the calluses on his hands.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smirked after seeing the shopkeeper and revealed a very interested smile.</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper noticed Li Qiye and smiled back: “Sir, do you want to go out or need something?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled back: “How can you prove that your reputation has been great for more than eighty million years?”</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper laughed and replied: “Ah, Sir, just look at my age and you should know that I am not a swindler. My hair is completely gray from the torments of time. At this age, why would I need to lie, right?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued to smile and leisurely responded: “Was it an eventful experience?”</p>
 <p>“You are asking about my life?” The shopkeeper happily responded: “It wasn’t bad, so-so I guess. I don’t want much at this age, only a full belly. And of course, my old bones have a bunch of children and grandchildren as well. What more do I want? Just food and clothing and children playing around me, this is more than enough for an old man like me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded while looking at him and movingly said: “You’re right, what more do you want in life? Warmth and food with children surrounding you — quite an enviable lifestyle.”</p>
 <p>The talkative shopkeeper asked with a grin: “Sir, do you have any other pursuits in life?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye pondered for a bit before smiling at the shopkeeper: “I just want an answer, that’s all I need.”</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper rubbed his clothing with his callused hands and continued: “Who can have all the answers in life?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye responded: “No one knows the answer, which is why I require it.” With that, he turned and left the inn.</p>
 <p>“What is the goal of life?” Li Qiye sighed and recalled the past. In a distant era, someone had asked him the same question at Rainbow City.</p>
 <p>It had been said that the heaven and earth were too unreachable. All were mere ants below them, but this was also fine. It was just like the old man said, there was nothing bad about being content with a life surrounded by loved ones.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye walked on slowly in silence while contemplating this issue and the unforgettable words.</p>
 <p>Being an ant within this unreachable heaven and earth was not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
 <p>He became lost in a daze. There was once an extremely wise man here who eventually chose a peaceful ending.</p>
 <p>After a while, he lifted his head towards the distance. With an incomparably firm gaze, as if nothing and nobody could shake him, he said: “No matter how distant the heaven and earth might be and regardless of how long this path is before the end, I just need an answer. This has always been the case in the past, the present, and will be so in the future as well!”</p>
 <p>He smiled freely after this and entered the streets full of pedestrians.</p>
 <p>Rainbow City was too large to be measured. Even though there were very few landmasses in the Heaven Spirit World, there were still several big cities. The ones here weren’t necessarily the biggest ones in this world, but they were definitely among the top ten.</p>
 <p>Dragonhark, as the first stopping point, was very lively. This was the biggest market in Rainbow City. It could even be considered the largest in all of Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>There were sea demons from this region, charming spirits from the Abyss Sea, and treants from the Jade Sea.</p>
 <p>In addition to the many shops, cultivators set up little stalls along the streets to sell their treasures and some were searching for alchemy ingredients. It was a scene that encompassed all sorts of images.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators came here due to the great reputation and size of this market at Dragonhark. There was a phrase used to describe this place: there is nothing one couldn’t buy here for the right price.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye bought a lot of materials for Zhang Baitu. They weren’t that precious, which was why he just went outside to buy them.</p>
 <p>He was getting ready to destroy Baitu’s cultivation in order to have him start over from the beginning. Because his cultivation was needlessly complex and convoluted, it was only harmful without any benefits.</p>
 <p>Of course, it would have been much easier for a young cultivator to destroy their cultivation, but it was different for Zhang Baitu. He was no longer young and his blood energy was quite feeble. Without being supplemented by pills, destroying his cultivation would only send him to see his maker.</p>
 <p>After preparing all the alchemy ingredients, he readied the cauldron to refine them. The flame ignited and melted all the ingredients. It burned away the dregs and left behind the essences.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the fire flowed like a pot of soup within. In this moment, it was difficult to tell the fire from the medicinal essences.</p>
 <p>Under Li Qiye’s instruction, Zhang Baitu stepped into the cauldron. The fire seemed to have its own life and slowly infiltrated Zhang Baitu’s body with the essences. They protected his meridians and veins.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ordered: “Remember, focus your energy while clearing your mind of needless thoughts.”</p>
 <p>Any carelessness would result in death for an old cultivator like Zhang Baitu, so Li Qiye had no choice but to use this method.</p>
 <p>The old man followed his order and calmed his mind while converging his vitality. He could feel the essences flowing through his body.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Li Qiye began and shattered Zhang Baitu’s dao foundation with lightning speed.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” Zhang Baitu’s dao foundation collapsed in an instant. He trembled and almost audibly screamed, but he managed to endure the pain.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was fast and accurate as he quickly and completely destroyed the foundation. At this time, there was nothing left of the broken foundation in Zhang Baitu. All of the residue was destroyed without leaving behind any traces.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu now resembled a mortal that had never cultivated before. The essences began to integrate into the key locations in his body, every muscle and joint, in order to strengthen him.</p>
 <p>His condition stabilized due to the medicine. Otherwise, someone else at his age experiencing this process would immediately turn into a hunchback old man after losing their dao foundation.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye withdrew the fire and Zhang Baitu fell to the ground. There weren’t too many visible changes to him. His hair had become grayer and he had lost the aura of a cultivator. However, his complexion was quite ruddy like an immortal with gray hair, yet he still had the face of a young man. This was a very healthy and rare constitution for a mortal man.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu’s vision worsened and he was unable to walk as if he was flying like other cultivators. Most of his abilities were gone as well. Of course, this was the great difference between a mortal and a cultivator.</p>
 <p>“Maybe it isn’t that bad being a mortal sometimes.” Zhang Baitu sighed emotionally after his regression.</p>
 <p>The sense of loss was there, but it was not overwhelming. After all, his cultivation was extremely shallow in the first place. This would be a completely different scenario for a master. Some wouldn’t be able to handle losing their cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Young Noble.” Zhang Baitu quickly thanked Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively: “There’s no need to be emotional, what you have lost will return not long from now.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you wish to pass down a merit law to me?!” Zhang Baitu happily asked right away after hearing this.</p>
 <p>Despite knowing his terrible talents and that he wouldn’t get much further in his life in terms of cultivation, he had never given up before. Persistence was part of his character.</p>
 <p>His hope had been rekindled after becoming a mortal and listening to Li Qiye.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1241: Dragonhark Valley</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head in response: “No, I don’t have the right merit law to pass down to you. A member of the Zhang must cultivate the Zhang Clan’s law.”</p>
 <p>“But my clan’s laws have been lost for a long time now.” Zhang Baitu hesitated for a moment before speaking: “Even Dongting Lake might not have our laws. None of the ancestors said anything about it.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly replied: “Your Zhang Clan doesn’t have them and the lake might not either, but Dragonhark Valley will.”</p>
 <p>“Dragonhark Valley?” Zhang Baitu was surprised: “Why would my clan’s laws be at the valley?” He didn’t understand the connection between the two entities.</p>
 <p>“To be more exact, those laws exist in this place.” With that, Li Qiye pointed at his head and said: “If you are able to be enlightened at the valley, you will obtain your clan’s merit laws once more.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was dazed. Even though he was not good at cultivation, he was not a fool. With a slightly startled expression, he asked: “Young Noble, are you saying that my clan’s laws came from the valley itself?”</p>
 <p>“You can put it that way.” Li Qiye nonchalantly spoke: “Your forefathers’ bloodline is not the purest of human bloodlines, so your members can only cultivate the clan’s laws. Through meditation and enlightenment at the valley, you will find what you desire.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu looked distracted. He knew far less than Li Qiye about his own ancestors, but he didn’t dare to ask why Li Qiye was aware of this.</p>
 <p>“Can, can I do it?” He was lacking confidence after calming down.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t be blamed for this since failure had haunted him for years. The failure of his first attempt at cultivation had already shattered his confidence completely, leaving him unsure of himself.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stared at him and replied: “A calm heart is more important than anything else. During your meditation, stay calm and everything will flow naturally. You are the descendant of the Zhang Clan; if you can’t do it, who can? Remember, your Zhang bloodline flows through you. This makes you different from everyone else.”</p>
 <p>After being encouraged by Li Qiye, Zhang Baitu could feel his blood beginning to stir.</p>
 <p>“In this world, talent is not the most crucial thing, an unfaltering dao heart is much more important. After so many years, countless geniuses have failed, it’s not just you. Even invincible Immortal Emperors have failed many times during their youth. No one can be unstoppable throughout their entire life. Only through failure will one understand their own lackings. Lessons and experiences can be gained from failure…” Li Qiye took his time encouraging and waking up Zhang Baitu.</p>
 <p>The old man’s eyes lit up. In a short period of time, he could feel the blood of the Zhang Clan channeling even faster. He was full of hope at this moment.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he kneeled on the ground and gratefully said: “I will engrave your wise words into my mind and never forget them.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ordered: “Very good. Let us go to Dragonhark Valley then.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu nodded. At this time, he was full of energy and felt that he was suddenly young again, just like the past when he began his arduous search for the first time.</p>
 <p>Dragonhark Valley was located in the southern region of Dragonhark. The entire valley was huge with exquisite sceneries consisting of tall peaks, tranquil ravines, and many waterfalls…</p>
 <p>There were many legends about this valley. One stated that the old giant dragon back then was enlightened in this valley and left behind an indelible mark.</p>
 <p>Another stated that the demon dragon who went against the heavens and failed left its magical bones behind after dying. Some of these magical bones eventually turned into Dragonhark Valley.</p>
 <p>No one knows if these two rumors were real or not. However, many people came to the valley in search for the grand dao from the legends, the legacy of a true dragon. Alas, despite their pursuit for the mysteries here, many left empty-handed.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, some claimed to have heard a dragon’s roar coming from the valley. After going back, they eventually comprehended more of the dao. A few of them became experts and claimed that they had heard whispers of a true dragon granting them great wisdom.</p>
 <p>No one had heard of someone being able to obtain the legacy of this true dragon or the legendary magical bones. Nevertheless, there were indeed tangible benefits present at the valley.</p>
 <p>The two came to the entrance of the valley that resembled the gaping jaws of a dragon. Just this scene alone showed that the valley's reputation was more than just empty rumors.</p>
 <p>The moment they entered, they could see that there was already a line of cultivators waiting. Some were sticking around to watch as well.</p>
 <p>“Get in line, hurry up.” An old man dressed in a light blue robe with a pointed hat was guarding this entrance.</p>
 <p>“Ten Heavenly King Jades, an extremely fair price.” The old man collected money while yelling: “Come, come, do not miss the one and only Dragonhark Valley in this world. Inside are true dragon bones, immortal draconic runes… As long as you are lucky enough, you will be able to obtain these mythical artifacts…”</p>
 <p>“... Think about it, just ten Heavenly King Jades to trade for dragon bones and runes… What a generous trade!” The old man’s voice was quite powerful: “With these artifacts, the next sea god could be you, the contemporary Immortal Emperor can’t be anyone else but you, becoming a treefather is possible as well. Ten Heavenly King Jades to win a chance at becoming a sea god, proving your regal ascendance or transforming into a treefather. This is the best transaction you could ever have.”</p>
 <p>The old man kept on shouting like a street peddler while collecting all the jades.</p>
 <p>“Are you serious?” A young first-timer heard this and had to ask: “Are there really true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes in there?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, little fella, don’t listen to him.” An older cultivator laughed and explained: “He has always been shouting these words. Fifty years ago when I last came, he was saying the same thing.”</p>
 <p>“You can’t put it like that.” The old man answered with a serious tone: “My reputation is as valuable as gold and is completely trustworthy. I guarantee in the name of my ancestors that there are indeed draconic bones and runes inside.”</p>
 <p>“Stop! You told me the same thing fifty years ago and tricked me to come several times while giving you everything I had. In the end, did I leave with anything but empty hands?” The old cultivator retorted with disdain while feeling annoyed.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t become angry with his answer: “I can’t be blamed for this. It only shows that you did not research enough. Otherwise, after several entries, you should have been able to get lucky, find the artifacts, and embark on the heaven-defying path to becoming a sea god and marrying a goddess, that’s for sure. Come, come, come now. Ten Heavenly King Jades, this is an amazing deal.”</p>
 <p>The old cultivator snorted and wasn’t tempted by the old man.</p>
 <p>A skeptical cultivator remarked: “If there are truly draconic bones and runes inside, then how come you aren’t keeping them for your own use?”</p>
 <p>The old man shook his head and said: “Fellow daoist, your perspective is too mundane. People say that the heavenly treasures of this world are meant for the destined. What kind of items are true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes? They are supreme immortal artifacts, so how can a lowly man like me obtain them? Because of this, I am leaving this opportunity to the fated ones.”</p>
 <p>The skeptic had no response and kept quiet after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Plus, many experts benefitted from coming to Dragonhark Valley. When an overlord heard the sound of the rain in this place, he immediately became enlightened and soared to the heavens overnight. There was also a sea god who listened to the wind. In just one day, he created an invincible art, and from then on, he alone was unbeatable in this world…” The old man became quite excited as he blabbered on and on.</p>
 <p>A cultivator quietly muttered under his breath: “How outrageous...”</p>
 <p>Of course, the overlord and sea god mentioned by the old man were all exaggerations. However, it was undeniable that there had been masters in the valley who obtained great harvests by just listening to the sounds in the valley itself.</p>
 <p>After his long boast, he told the skeptic from earlier: “Okay, do you want in or not? If not, then go to the side. People are all lining up behind you.”</p>
 <p>This skeptic hesitated for a moment but still decided to pay to enter the valley.</p>
 <p>In the line, Li Qiye cheerfully smiled at this old man. He enjoyed listening to him a lot.</p>
 <p>When it was Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu’s turn, Baitu only looked at Li Qiye since he couldn’t take out so many refined jades.</p>
 <p>“Two people so twenty Heavenly King Jades.” The old man smiled at them.</p>
 <p>No matter how one looked at them, neither Li Qiye or Zhang Baitu looked like people with money, so a human cultivator kindly reminded them: “Little brother, refined jades don’t come easily, you are better off using them wisely.”</p>
 <p>“Little brat! It’s fine if you don’t want to come in, but you want to ruin my business as well? Do you want me to throw you into the Bonesea right now?!” The old man violently changed his tune right away after seeing this human wanting to interfere with his business.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1242: Zhang Baitu’s Dao Enlightenment</b></p>
 <p>The human cultivator fled right away after being scolded by the old man. Throughout history, no one dared to offend Rainbow City. Rumor has it that even a contemporary sea god wouldn’t test them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and handed the refined jades over.</p>
 <p>The old man immediately beamed happily after getting the refined jades and said: “I wish you two luck in comprehending the supreme grand dao to reach the peak of this world.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye grinned and looked at the old man and leisurely spoke: “You said earlier that there are draconic bones and runes in the valley. If I carelessly dig them up, do they all belong to me then?”</p>
 <p>“Well.” The old man’s expression changed after hearing this but he still revealed a smile in the end: “Well, yes, of course.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye saw his expression and started to laugh before patting his shoulder and said: “I’m just joking. I’ll only take him to listen to the sounds here for dao enlightenment.” With that, he brought Zhang Baitu into the valley.</p>
 <p>The old man’s smile froze as his body became stiff. He watched Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu disappear into the valley.</p>
 <p>“I have to go too.” Eventually, someone from the line spoke up, waking the old man up from his stupor. Just thinking about Li Qiye’s grin left the old man frightened with chills running down his spine.</p>
 <p>“Rascal, don’t play with me.” Eventually, the old man murmured in a low voice that only he could hear.</p>
 <p>This was Zhang Baitu’s first time coming to Dragonhark. Even though he knew about it beforehand, he didn’t have enough money for the entry fee.</p>
 <p>He curiously asked: “Does this place really have those mythical items?” In his eyes, Li Qiye was an expert at everything.</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t think about these things.” Li Qiye beamingly smiled in response: “Finding them is nice, but it’s fine to be without them as well. They are not meant for you.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu quietly nodded. He naturally didn’t have unrealistic expectations. In his eyes, being able to comprehend the Zhang merit laws was more than enough. As for the bones and runes, they were supreme items that he didn’t dare to think about.</p>
 <p>There were beautiful sceneries everywhere in this big valley with majestic cliffs, elegant springs, and a pleasant melody from the rustling leaves.</p>
 <p>They saw cultivators in many places. Some were sitting on top of cliffs while huffing and puffing the energy of the clouds. Others were meditating below waterfalls to quietly listen to the sound of the water. There were also those sitting in the pine forest in order to comprehend the grand dao.</p>
 <p>Even though ten Heavenly King Jades were a lot to many, experts from great powers were willing to try at least once. Who in this world didn’t want to become enlightened in the dao?</p>
 <p>Moreover, for those who had reached a bottleneck, they needed an opportunity to break through.</p>
 <p>There were rumors that there were dragon roars or even the whispering of a true dragon in this valley. How could there be smoke without fire? Some experts had made these claims before while meditating in this place.</p>
 <p>Because of this, many cultivators came here in hopes of getting lucky. Perhaps they would be able to experience the same type of adventures as well.</p>
 <p>The duo crossed over the mountains and went deeper inside towards their destination.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, have you been here before?” Zhang Baitu asked after seeing how familiar Li Qiye was with this place. Li Qiye only responded with a mysterious grin.</p>
 <p>Many of the cultivators they met didn’t find anything, so they kept on changing their location.</p>
 <p>“Eh, isn’t that Hundred-Disciple?” A few cultivators recognized Zhang Baitu along the way. The majority of them were from the sects near Dongting Lake. [1. Baitu = Hundred-Disciple.]</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu had joined many sects without any results. Because of this, the cultivators near Dongting Lake all knew about him.</p>
 <p>“Zhang Baitu, are you here to listen to the valley as well?” A cultivator shook his head and laughed: “In my opinion, you should be saving money to buy a coffin, that will save a lot of trouble. You have joined so many sects for no reason, do you think you will actually gain anything here at Dragonhark Valley?”</p>
 <p>Another cultivator saw Li Qiye standing next to him and mocked: “Who would have thought that you, Zhang Baitu, would actually try to be exemplary one day and take in a disciple. Hey, child, finding a master is a lifelong event, so you can’t be careless or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life after finding the wrong master.”</p>
 <p>The majority of the people who recognized Zhang Baitu started with taunts or mocked Li Qiye. Of course, there were some who had good intentions and advised Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn’t respond to any of them and only followed right behind Li Qiye. He had grown used to these remarks and had heard much worse before.</p>
 <p>After a while, in a more remote location, he whispered: “It is my fault for tarnishing your reputation, Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively and insipidly commented: “There’s no need to take to heart the words of mere ants.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn't say anything else and continued to follow him.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the two went into a thicket with fresh verdant leaves. When the breeze blew by, one could hear their fluttering rattle like a melody.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye walked around before stopping in front of a dying tree. He carefully looked at this old tree and nodded: “Right here.”</p>
 <p>He then ordered Zhang Baitu: “Sit with your back against this tree and calm your mind. Block off your six senses to feel its rhythm. Remember, stay calm — this is the only way you will feel its existence.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu solemnly shook his head and took a deep breath. He sat down firmly under this old tree with his back against it. He closed his eyes and shut off his six senses then began to feel it.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked over him for a bit before quietly leaving. At the same time, he casually drew a circle around this thicket.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu meditated in order to sense this old tree. However, moments passed by and there were no signs of change. In the beginning, he was able to keep calm, but he gradually lost his patience and his breathing turned rapid.</p>
 <p>“Remember, it exists when your heart is calm. You are the descendant of the Zhang Clan, this is something you should have. Be patient and persevere.” Li Qiye was watching everything from a distance.</p>
 <p>His words were like a tranquilizing pill. The anxious Zhang Baitu slowly calmed down again with steady breaths. His quiet meditation began once more.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that Zhang Baitu? Is he actually thinking about comprehending the dao?” Someone laughed while looking at Zhang Baitu meditating under the tree.</p>
 <p>Another said with disdain: “He wants to understand the dao? Such wishful thinking.”</p>
 <p>Their companion sarcastically commented: “People say that one can only succeed after experiencing failures and learning from the lessons. Zhang Baitu had so many masters after joining numerous sects for nothing at all, so maybe he has accumulated enough experience. Come, let us see if he can comprehend anything.”</p>
 <p>Although some cultivators were dismissive of him, others were irritated by their own lack of progress, so they wanted to tease him to get rid of their bad mood. In their eyes, Zhang Baitu was only a piece of trash. They could humiliate him however they want.</p>
 <p>“Don’t cross the line.” Li Qiye coldly spoke the moment these ill-willed cultivators approached his line.</p>
 <p>These cultivators stopped and one of them laughed: “Oh? You must be Zhang Baitu’s disciple. Hah, a foolish master can only produce an idiotic disciple. You think you can comprehend the dao here as well?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored him and emotionlessly repeated: “Don’t cross the line or face the consequences.”</p>
 <p>“Brat, who do you think you are?!” Li Qiye’s attitude made a few younger cultivators with some status quite annoyed. They contemptuously spoke: “You think we’ll listen to you? What are you going to do about it? Only an ant yet you still dare to shout in front of us! So what if we cross the line, are you gonna bite me? Oh wait, I forgot, a dog that bites will never bark.”</p>
 <p>With that, they headed towards Zhang Baitu.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye. Instead, he performed a sweeping kick. These cultivators turned furious after seeing this, and one of the nobles said: “Naive fool!”</p>
 <p>“Bang!” They couldn’t even counter since they were kicked flying by Li Qiye. Blood spurted out along with many explosions; Li Qiye mercilessly sent them into many huge trees with blood spraying everywhere.</p>
 <p>He then stared at them coldly and slowly walked over.</p>
 <p>At this time, these pale cultivators were frightened. They wanted to crawl back up, especially the noble-looking one. He screamed: “You, don’t come over here, don’t come over here!”</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1243: Dragon Sound</b></p>
 <p>“Ah—” In a short period of time, screams resounded left and right in these woods along with a series of bone-breaking noises.</p>
 <p>At this time, Li Qiye was stomping on the legs of these cultivators. Their legs were crushed completely as they howled like slaughtered pigs. These shrill screams echoed across the thicket.</p>
 <p>“Who is so ruthless?” The screams alarmed some of the nearby cultivators. They came with curiosity and saw Li Qiye’s leg-breaking fest. Their eyes darted at each other and wondered just who this human kid was and why he dared to be so vicious.</p>
 <p>Eventually, with a loud bang, Li Qiye stomped on the noble-looking youth and coldly glared at him.</p>
 <p>The paled cultivator busily shouted: “Don’t, don’t do anything stupid. I, I am a disciple of the Wyvern Country, a great power in the Dragon Demon Sea. If, if you dare to kill me, my country will not treat it lightly.”</p>
 <p>“Ah!” His wrist was stomped by Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>This Wyvern disciple and everyone else shut up. They knew that they had messed with the wrong guy. This fella was too ruthless.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only wanted to teach them a lesson. If he wanted to kill them, it would have been easier than crushing an ant.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Li Qiye kicked this disciple from Wyvern flying through many trees while shouting: “Scram, don’t let me see you again!”</p>
 <p>These cultivators pissed their pants from fear. After hearing this, it was like they had been pardoned; they quickly rolled on the ground to get up and run away.</p>
 <p>The disciple from Wyvern was from a great power and so couldn't swallow his anger. After he flew far enough, he exclaimed: “Brat, leave, leave your name if you dare!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave him a side-eye and replied: “Li Qiye.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, the disciple faltered several steps backward in horror. He had just heard this name recently.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators who were watching for fun were startled as well, especially those who heard the news from the Jade Sea, they became completely pale. One of them said: “He is the disciple of the Peacock Tree, the successor of that land. He, he helped the tree sacrifice a billion Teeming Fish, no wonder why he is so ruthless!”</p>
 <p>News of the tree’s blood refinement had reached the Dragon Demon Sea. Of course, many believed that this was the masterpiece of the Peacock Tree while Li Qiye only acted as the tree controller. He became famous overnight due to the prestige that came with being an ancestral tree’s disciple.</p>
 <p>A cultivator commented in horror: “Damn! He helped the Peacock Tree annihilate an entire race. This ancestral tree is definitely a monster, so being its disciple, he can’t be a kind person either; he’s definitely a little monster as well.”</p>
 <p>The massacre of the Teeming Race, the most populous tribe in Heaven Spirit, had shocked countless people. This added to Li Qiye’s notoriety despite everyone assuming that he was only the treefather’s accomplice.</p>
 <p>Just imagine, billions of lives were refined overnight. Anyone would quiver with weak knees after hearing this. As for the Wyvern disciple and his companions, needless to say, they turned and fled as far as they could. They didn’t dare to think about taking revenge any longer. Li Qiye’s fierce reputation had shattered their courage.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, the cultivators outside the thicket had ugly expressions. Many even chose to run away to avoid provoking this fierce person.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored them and leaned on a tree as he watched Zhang Baitu.</p>
 <p>A long time had passed, yet there was still no changes with Zhang Baitu. Nevertheless, Li Qiye was confident in him because the Zhang had some ties with this place as well as Rainbow City. It was just that their descendants didn’t know about these secrets.</p>
 <p>Minutes came and went, but Zhang Baitu remained motionless as if he didn’t gain anything.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, very few would watch him meditate. After all, those who had heard of his name knew that his talents were completely insufficient since he was still a failure after joining so many sects. They thought that this was simply a waste of time.</p>
 <p>However, after being aware of Li Qiye’s great name, some became curious. Even though they didn’t know why this fierce man was hanging around Zhang Baitu, they wanted to see if the old man could harvest anything.</p>
 <p>One thing was for certain as the clock ticked down, Zhang Baitu had reached a state of total calmness.</p>
 <p>A while later, a crisp voice resounded next to Li Qiye: “Will Brother Zhang be able to do it?”</p>
 <p>No one knows when Hong Yujiao appeared beside Li Qiye. She was quite worried while watching Zhang Baitu under the tree.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly said: “All of you know nothing about what kind of people your ancestors were and what they experienced. This is because you have no interest in them at all.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao couldn’t refute because she was indeed ignorant of them.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao eventually spoke: “You are the successor of Peacock Land, a tree controller.” After returning, she uncovered all of his information and understood his identity.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t answer and continued his watch.</p>
 <p>“I misunderstood you before.” She spoke after a moment of silence: “The Peacock Treefather has always been protecting the human race and is adored by many. You are its disciple, so I’m sure you weren’t scheming against Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled after hearing this. It seemed that the misconception of him being related to the Peacock Tree had spread uncontrollably. However, he was too lazy to correct them.</p>
 <p>“My father wants to meet you.” She eventually revealed her goal.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and replied: “What does he want to talk about? The Hundred-Saints Hall or what happened with the Ironscale School?”</p>
 <p>“Most likely the business of the human race.” She replied: “Peacock Land is the second largest haven for humans after the Exquisite Valley. Even though Dongting Lake isn’t as large as Peacock Land, there are many things that can be done to mutual benefit.”</p>
 <p>“That’s fine, if he wants to talk, tell him to come and see me.” Li Qiye just smiled with a completely indifferent attitude.</p>
 <p>She refrained from speaking. Li Qiye’s words sounded like a command for her father, so she couldn’t exactly tell him this.</p>
 <p>“It’s time.” Li Qiye had been fixated on Zhang Baitu the whole time. His eyes flashed as he noticed something.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao quickly turned to look at her senior brother as well. A buzzing emanated from Zhang Baitu’s body as it lit up, emitting a frightening light.</p>
 <p>The old tree behind him unexpectedly shook a little bit along with his body; it was as if they were touching something. The brilliance from his body increased as time went on, and the light slowly turned into rays.</p>
 <p>The tree then stopped moving and a very faint sound came about. While listening to it carefully, one could vaguely hear the roar of a true dragon. The roar sounded as if it was saying something, but humans couldn’t understand it.</p>
 <p>“Is that really the sound of a dragon?” The cultivators outside the thicket were astonished.</p>
 <p>“What? How is this possible? Zhang Baitu actually obtained a fortune?” Some of them couldn’t believe this scene while murmuring to themselves.</p>
 <p>They felt that this was simply impossible. Even though people said that dragon cries were present in the valley, only a very small number of masters were able to hear them. Others didn’t have this privilege.</p>
 <p>Thus, it was even more impossible for Zhang Baitu who was known to have rubbish talent. Continuously failing despite joining so many sects left others thinking of him as a being that was hopelessly stupid.</p>
 <p>It would be daydreaming for someone like him to think about gaining enlightenment in Dragonhark Valley.</p>
 <p>However, a strange visual phenomenon was occurring around him. The impossible was unraveling before the crowd.</p>
 <p>“That’s a dragon’s cry?” Hong Yujiao became absent-minded as well. She didn’t have much hope in Zhang Baitu either. It was not because she looked down on him, but because he indeed possessed some flaws in terms of cultivation.</p>
 <p>“I think so.” The cultivators outside were jolted. They quickly sat down and focused in order to listen. They wanted to understand what the dragon was saying to obtain this fortune.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao attentively listened as well in order to comprehend the faint cries of the dragon.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1244: Dao Breakthrough</b></p>
 <p>With the passage of time, Zhang Baitu’s body became increasingly luminous while the dragon sounds from the old tree became more sonorous. In the end, it was no longer a vague sound, it truly became the voice of a dragon.</p>
 <p>“It really is a dragon’s cry! The valley truly has them!” The voice of the dragon had alarmed many people. More and more came and were jolted by this sound.</p>
 <p>Despite the rumors of its existence, few people had heard it before. Many had failed and given up in the past, but now, they were both ecstatic and somewhat afraid after hearing it.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, many cultivators began meditating right outside of this thicket and carefully listened to the profundities encompassed within these draconic sounds. By successfully doing so, perhaps they could understand the great mysteries of the supreme grand dao. From that, it might lead them to the path where the true dragon bones and immortal draconic runes awaited.</p>
 <p>However, despite their best efforts, they couldn’t understand it. Even Hong Yujiao was no exception.</p>
 <p>As time passed, the light from Zhang Baitu’s body gradually dimmed and the dragon’s voice from the old tree became fainter until it disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>Many listeners returned to the present after it disappeared. They received nothing out of it since they couldn’t understand what it was saying or the mysteries within.</p>
 <p>They, instead, stared at Zhang Baitu in disbelief, especially those who knew about him beforehand. This was an incredibly cruel joke.</p>
 <p>He stood up before the crowd with a delighted expression. Without a doubt, he had quite a harvest. He walked to the front of Li Qiye and immediately prostrated to express his gratitude: “Thank you for guiding me from my past mistakes, this lowly one will never forget your kindness for the rest of my life.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded his head and accepted the grand gesture.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, Senior Brother. With today’s enlightenment, your future potential is limitless.” Hong Yujiao was happy for Zhang Baitu. By finally being able to take this step, he would surely have many amazing accomplishments later on.</p>
 <p>“Sister, you are too kind. I only learned a little bit and can’t be shameless enough to accept the praise of having limitless potential.” Zhang Baitu was very modest in his response.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, he was still very excited because, in his eyes, only geniuses would be able to explore the grand dao. Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t reach this level, let alone a stupid person like himself.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t even train regular merit laws, so he didn’t dare to think about the impossibility that was exploring the grand dao. However, he felt as if his mind had been cleared. With his newfound wisdom, a grand dao was appearing right before him.</p>
 <p>People stared at him in disbelief due to his past reputation of being an incurable fool. It was simply inconceivable that such a guy could have become enlightened from listening to the voice of a dragon.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.” Li Qiye told Zhang Baitu and turned to walk away.</p>
 <p>The brother and sister quickly followed him out of the thicket.</p>
 <p>Of course, this valley didn’t only have dragon cries. It also contained other supreme immortal items, but Li Qiye naturally wouldn’t search for them.</p>
 <p>After they left, a bunch of cultivators immediately jumped into the thicket and competed for the spot below the old tree.</p>
 <p>The first cultivator that got to the tree said: “I was here first, let me try to meditate.”</p>
 <p>“Why do you get to go first? Everyone here has paid, so if you want to meditate, the rest of us should be able to as well.” Another immediately voiced his displeasure.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the scene became chaotic. Everyone wanted to sit under this old tree to meditate. They felt that if a fool like Zhang Baitu could hear a dragon’s voice under the tree, then the rest of them would be able to gain much more than him.</p>
 <p>The news of Zhang Baitu’s enlightenment spread across the valley. Many people had thought that it was not worth spending money to enter the valley, but they were now tempted and immediately handed their jades over to jump inside. They didn’t want to be one step slower than the others.</p>
 <p>When Li Qiye got outside of the valley, he looked at the old man and leisurely smiled: “I heard that there is a treasure trove at Dragonwell, is that true?”</p>
 <p>The old man’s expression changed after hearing this. Li Qiye laughed in response: “Don’t worry, I’m just messing with you. As for the treasure trove and dragon bones, they should be left for the destined ones.” With that, he turned and left.</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you an eighty percent discount next time.” The old man cheerfully smiled at Li Qiye who was walking away.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t turn around to answer.</p>
 <p>After they walked for a while, Hong Yujiao curiously asked: “Does Dragonhark really have dragon bones and runes?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued on while lightly answering: “Their existence isn’t important since they are not destined to be yours. However, if you must know, just keep in mind that your Dongting Lake and Rainbow City have deep ties. The same goes for the Giant Dragon Kingdom. I hope that as the lake’s descendants, you two won’t forget about your ancestors and roots. One day, you might need to rely on Rainbow City.”</p>
 <p>“We have deep ties with Rainbow City and the Giant Dragon Kingdom?” Hong Yujiao was surprised.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu felt the same way. He had never heard about this before and spoke with disbelief: “I heard that the Giant Dragon Kingdom doesn’t actually exist since it is only part of the legends. No one has been there before.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped and turned to look at the two: “It looks like you descendants are becoming worse and worse since you don’t even know your own roots. Just keep my words in mind. Aim higher than other people while maintaining your ambition and courage. Your clans chose to fight each other for power, but in the eyes of others, this is only a competition between ants. No one will care about the past glory of your ancestors.”</p>
 <p>The duo exchanged glances. They didn’t completely understand what Li Qiye was referring to.</p>
 <p>“Rely on each other during times of turmoil while maintaining great magnanimity towards all as well as your ancestors’ great moral values. One day, you two will understand your roots and at that time, those existences up in the clouds will finally take note of you. That will be the day when you find out just how glorious your clans used to be!”</p>
 <p>He gently sighed and left one final remark while looking at them: “This is all I can do. The future relies on juniors like the two of you to build.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t want to bother with Dongting Lake’s power struggle back then, but right now, out of consideration for the ancestors from the Hong, Zhang and Xu Clans, Li Qiye couldn’t help but ultimately guide them. Whether they would be able to figure it out and take the next step would be up to themselves.</p>
 <p>They must be the ones to grasp their own destinies. Others could only show them the way.</p>
 <p>The duo carefully contemplated Li Qiye’s words. Even though they didn’t understand them completely, they certainly memorized them.</p>
 <p>They didn’t go too far after leaving the valley when a young man came before them. He had an extraordinary presence and a bright glow. There was a pair of translucent jade-like horns that made him look quite fierce.</p>
 <p>He grew happy the moment he saw Hong Yujiao and quickly walked forward to enthusiastically greet them: “Young Sister, we meet again.” [1. The sister for this one is for family friends.]</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Shangguan, long time no see.” Hong Yujiao nodded her head in a polite manner that wasn’t overly welcoming yet not too distant at the same time.</p>
 <p>The youth enthusiastically asked Hong Yujiao: “I heard that you wanted to go to Rainbow City. That’s great, how about we go together to Dragonhark Valley?”</p>
 <p>She gently shook her head in response: “Thank you, but I was summoned by my seniors and must return to the sect.”</p>
 <p>The youth became disappointed after hearing this. His eyes then darted over towards Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Since the beginning, he didn’t care for Li Qiye, but after seeing Li Qiye’s face, his eyes narrowed and he coldly stared at him: “You are Li Qiye, the successor of Peacock Land?”</p>
 <p>“So what?” Li Qiye glanced at him in response.</p>
 <p>The youth coldly said: “It’s very good that you have admitted it. You are the one who harmed disciples from my Wyvern Country.”</p>
 <p>So it turned out that this youth was the Wyvern Crown Prince, Shangguan Feilong. He had recently heard of Li Qiye since his fellow disciples were beaten by him. He wanted to settle the score with Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye indifferently replied: “Maybe.”</p>
 <p>“Remember that this isn’t your Peacock Land. This is the Dragon Demon Sea, not a place for you to act presumptuously.” Shangguan Feilong coldly said: “You need to give our country a proper answer for hurting our disciples.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Shangguan, your disciples were at fault.” Hong Yujiao slowly spoke: “They provoked Young Noble Li which resulted in them being injured. They can only blame themselves for their lack of skill.”</p>
 <p>At this time, Hong Yujiao stood up for Li Qiye.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1245: Dragonwell City</b></p>
 <p>After hearing Hong Yujiao, Shangguan Feilong darted his eyes at Li Qiye. Despite being unwilling, he still scowled and said: “Our disciples were incapable, and out of consideration for Young Sister Hong, I won’t pursue this any further. But Li, you better control yourself, this is the territory of us sea demons!”</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, this was a direct threat towards Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t really care. He had no intention of taking action against cultivators of Feilong’s level unless they were asking to die.</p>
 <p>Feilong glared at Li Qiye one last time before cupping his fists at Hong Yujiao: “Young Sis, I have met my big sister, she says that she also wants to see Uncle. Wait for us after the birthday celebration of the Jian Ancestor, we will visit your house and see Uncle then.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao chose to be quiet instead of answering.</p>
 <p>After Feilong left, Zhang Baitu worriedly looked at her and said: “Junior Sister, it looks like his big sister is coming to ask for an engagement. He must be feeling quite confident this time.”</p>
 <p>Eventually, Hong Yujiao answered: “I won’t marry so easily.”</p>
 <p>“It won’t be that simple.” Despite not staying at Dongting Lake, Zhang Baitu still knew a few things, resulting in his worries: “I heard that the Wyvern Country has always wanted a human with a great bloodline to help pass on their own. People say that Feilong’s bloodline is very powerful, the best of the younger generation with the exception of his sister.”</p>
 <p>“I also heard that they wanted to become in-laws with the Exquisite Valley. Unfortunately for them, the valley refused right away.” Zhang Baitu continued: “Sister, your bloodline is the most exceptional in our lake, so the Wyvern Country won’t give up that easily. Plus, with his sister coming in person, they will also have the backing of the Roaring Conch, giving them ample leverage.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, so what if Shangguan Feiyan is back?” Hong Yujiao snorted: “Can they really force this marriage?!”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu could only sigh. There was no point in worrying about it since he wasn’t strong enough to do anything.</p>
 <p>Regardless of her tough posturing, she still reminded Li Qiye: “Young Noble Li, there’s no need to worry about this Shangguan Feilong. However, his sister, Shuangguan Feiyan, warrants some caution. She comes from the Roaring Conch and is doted on by its ancestors. People say that there is a possibility of her marrying the Seashield Prince to become the mistress of the Roaring Conch…”</p>
 <p>“... Sometimes, taking a step back is the right way to go about things. You don’t need to go head-on against the Wyvern Country.” She warned him with good intent: “After all, the Roaring Conch is very powerful at the Dragon Demon Sea. They can even order the sea demons around the world.”</p>
 <p>So it turns out that Shangguan Feilong came from Wyvern, a great power in this sea region. Of course, the thing they were most proud about was not the true dragon bloodline coursing through their veins, it was Shangguan Feiyan who was able to join the Roaring Conch and become one of the youngest God-Monarchs.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye responded to these warnings with a smile. Hong Yujiao sighed because she understood that her words went in one ear and out the other.</p>
 <p>After leaving the valley, she also wanted to return to Dongting Lake in order to report to her father. Before leaving, she respectfully said her goodbyes: “I’ll go report to my father about this. Hopefully, you will meet him at least once.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye insipidly responded: “Tell him to come meet me at Dragonwell.”</p>
 <p>After she left, Li Qiye told Zhang Baitu: “Go back and clean up your belongings, we’ll be going to Dragonwell.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu nodded. At this time, he would obey any command from Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>After packing his stuff, he followed Li Qiye to Dragonwell. This was the second stop of Rainbow City. There was only one way to go from Dragonhark to Dragonwell, and that was to ride the rainbow fish.</p>
 <p>Just like Dragonhark, no one knew where Dragonwell was located, they only knew that these fish were the only method of transportation linking all the cities together. At the very least, no one had heard of someone being able to go from one city to another using a different method.</p>
 <p>The duo arrived at the ferry again and found that there was already a long line. It was still an ordinary old man collecting money at the entrance.</p>
 <p>He had a light blue robe with an indifferent expression. He stared at the cultivators as if all of them owed him money.</p>
 <p>When it was Li Qiye’s turn, Li Qiye said: “To Dragonwell.”</p>
 <p>The old man glanced at the two and pointed at Zhang Baitu: “You, one Provisional Palace Jade.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was surprised and stammered: “It, it has always been free for me at Rainbow City. Rainbow Island to Dragonhark was free for me just earlier.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn’t really know why it had always been free for him. Maybe that particular old man knew that he didn’t have enough money to pay. Nevertheless, always paying no fee left him a bit embarrassed since he wasn’t the type who relished taking advantage of others.</p>
 <p>“One Provisional Palace Jade.” The old man ignored him then reached out his hand towards Li Qiye and coldly demanded: “You, one thousand Virtuous Paragon Jades.”</p>
 <p>“That’s outrageous!” Zhang Baitu was scared silly: “It didn’t cost us that much to come here from Rainbow Island.”</p>
 <p>“Pay if you want to go. If not, then scram already!” The old man angrily shouted, leaving no room for negotiation.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu glanced at Li Qiye. This old man clearly wanted to play them, especially Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled with a carefree attitude as he handed a black pouch over to the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man put the pouch away without looking at the contents before whistling for two rainbow fish.</p>
 <p>“How much will you charge me to go to the city in the clouds?” Li Qiye smiled at the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t bat an eye as he replied with the same emotionless expression: “Who knows.”</p>
 <p>“Money is not a problem.” Li Qiye leisurely pressed on: “I will have to go up there eventually, so take out your abacus to calculate how much it will cost.”</p>
 <p>The cold old man didn’t want to answer, so he didn’t make a single sound.</p>
 <p>After sitting on the fish, Li Qiye added in a serious tone: “Since I have to visit it either way, I hope the rainbow fish will take me there at that time, okay?”</p>
 <p>The old man remained quiet. At this time, the fish were spewing bubbles. They floated along the bubbles and disappeared right away.</p>
 <p>When Li Qiye and Zhang Baitu regained their vision, they were in a different city. This was the second stop of Rainbow City — Dragonwell.</p>
 <p>According to the legends, Dragonwell hid unparalleled treasures that remained veiled from the public eye.</p>
 <p>After they disembarked the fish, Zhang Baitu curiously asked: “Young Noble, what kind of city is above the clouds?”</p>
 <p>He knew that Rainbow City consisted of Dragonhark, Dragonwell, and Dragonspring, but he had never heard of a city above the clouds, people never mentioned it.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to know, so don’t ask.” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “If, one day, the people up there notice you, then you will naturally learn about them. Just keep trying, the future is still full of opportunities.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu didn’t ask again. He breathed deeply and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Stay at the Rainbow Pavilion branch.” Li Qiye casually handed some jades to Zhang Baitu before leaving.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu watched him leave without asking where he wanted to go and headed for the inn right afterward.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye walked along the long street with his heart slightly jumping. Something seemed to be affecting him as unwanted memories resurfaced in his mind.</p>
 <p>He took his time walking to the end of the street. An old mansion appeared before him. Its age didn’t affect its majestic aura, as if there was an overlord presiding over the estate.</p>
 <p>A wooden plaque with the word “Jian” could be found hanging at the entrance. It was written in an archaic style that contained infinite prestige.</p>
 <p>The Jian Clan of Rainbow City was a legendary existence. Despite its low profile, people still viewed it with awe and respect.</p>
 <p>Rumor has it that the Jian Clan were the only outsiders who were allowed to stay long-term at Rainbow City. This was the only stopping place for humans in the entire city.</p>
 <p>Rainbow City was vast. Many powerful lineages, such as the Seven Martial Pavilion and the Roaring Conch, wanted to establish their own strongholds or divisions in this place.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how strong they were, even when their sea gods were still alive, they couldn’t get into Rainbow City. These powerful lineages didn’t dare to act recklessly here without permission from the city.</p>
 <p></p>

 <a href="/novel/emperors-domination/emperor-chapter-1246" class="chapter-nav"> Next Chapter </a> 
</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1246: Jian Clan</b></p>
 <p>The Jian Clan had established their lineage in Rainbow City a very long time ago. They had a pivotal position in this place, similar to their position in the Dragon Demon Sea and all of Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>They were even more significant for the human race. As the only human lineage capable of staying in Rainbow City, the clan had done many favors for the human race.</p>
 <p>Even though the disciples from this clan rarely showed themselves outside of the city, they had always been very reasonable. No one has ever looked down on the Jian Clan, whether they be the charming spirit’s four branches or the treant’s Golden Isle as well as the sea demon’s Roaring Conch and Seven Martial Pavilion. Whenever their ancestors visited Dragonwell, they would go visit the Jian Clan as well.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, whenever the Jian Clan got involved, the parties would always show them some consideration.</p>
 <p>The origin of the Jian Clan remained unknown. Outsiders didn’t know what kind of lineage they were. The only thing known was that they were humans that were closely related to Rainbow City. This was not only a low-key clan but also one shrouded in mysteries.</p>
 <p>Many of the great powers, especially the behemoths, had traceable backgrounds. Their ancestors were either sea gods, treefathers, or Immortal Emperors. The weakest among their ancestors would be unstoppable Godkings, and tales of their ancestors would be sung in the contemporary.</p>
 <p>This was not the case for the Jian ancestors. The clan was just as mysterious as the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. It seemed that the clan suddenly appeared overnight. What was even stranger was that they established a stronghold in Rainbow City very quickly.</p>
 <p>While standing on the street and looking into the Jian Clan that was just inches away, Li Qiye felt an indescribable emotion. For him, the Jian Clan was also a home. Many of his footprints and memories were left in this place. However, he didn’t want to go inside right now.</p>
 <p>“The heavens is too unreachable, there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” A lass once whispered this to him.</p>
 <p>Whenever he stood before these gates, these words would echo in his mind. There was nothing in this world that could hinder his path or make him stop. Alas, this sentence haunted his mind and made him feel quite uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>Resting was impossible for him, at least not in this lifetime. For many, starting a family and having children was not difficult, but this was a life unattainable for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He sighed in disappointment and murmured: “I can’t do that. I will never be an ant that submits to the world. I am the bloodstained hand that will slay to the very end, death is my companion and blood makes up my bed!”</p>
 <p>Through the ages, some wished that he would continue on while others hoped that he could rest. Alas, these people eventually left the world. No one could persevere with him on this endless fight.</p>
 <p>There was a little shop along the path. It sold snacks and lighter dishes with only a few tables. It wasn’t early in the day anymore, but the old stove in the shop still let off curling steam and smoke.</p>
 <p>His heart slightly jolted after seeing the shop. He didn’t enter the Jian Clan and instead quietly sat down at a table.</p>
 <p>There was only one gray-haired old man working as both the waiter and the cook. His apron looked dated; it had been exposed to smoke for an incredible amount of time, yet it was still clean.</p>
 <p>The old man quickly came and asked after Li Qiye sat down: “Sir, what would you like?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye blurted out without thinking: “One bowl of boiled tofu.” This was an all too familiar answer. He gently sighed again when his mind returned.</p>
 <p>“Okay, coming right up.” The old man was very agile and immediately cooked some for him.</p>
 <p>“Boiled tofu...” Li Qiye smiled wryly. Back then, he had tasted this dish countless times at this very shop. This was a style that originated from the Mortal Emperor World and was next to impossible to forget.</p>
 <p>At that time, there were two little girls who also enjoyed eating here. In the faint steam, these two were always at odds. Who would have thought that one of them would eventually become an invincible empress?</p>
 <p>It didn’t take long before the old man presented the bowl before Li Qiye. Its warmth thawed his cold heart. He began eating each piece of slippery and tender tofu as the familiar taste melted in his mouth.</p>
 <p>“This boiled tofu is a delicacy in this world. No one will ever get tired of eating it.” Li Qiye had to comment.</p>
 <p>The old man revealed a simple smile and responded: “Sir, please don’t laugh, but this dish in my shop is a peerless recipe that originated from the Mortal Emperor World. It has been passed down in my home from one generation to another without fail.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye faintly smiled and continued to take his time eating. Of course, he knew where this craft came from more than anyone else.</p>
 <p>While savoring the familiar taste in his mouth in this mist-filled shop, it seemed that he had returned to those early years.</p>
 <p>In the hazy mist, he could see the two competitive little girls again. One had eyes full of wisdom while the other had a resolute glare.</p>
 <p>He suddenly saw the intelligent girl sitting there, quietly eating tofu with him. She didn’t utter a single word, but all that needed to be said had been told.</p>
 <p>Eventually, everything disappeared into the rising steam from the hot bowl of tofu. The two girls destined to become the empress and the wise one dispersed.</p>
 <p>Everything was in the past; both the empress and the wise goddess had turned to smoke. He was the only one left after the long years.</p>
 <p>A while later, he looked up and noticed the Jian Clan was decorated with lanterns and flowers. He asked the old man with an indifferent tone: “Is there a celebration at the Jian Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Sir, haven’t you heard?” The old man answered: “The 8,000th birthday of the Jian Grandfather is coming up, everyone from all over the seas are coming to wish him happy birthday.” [1. This is one of those polite appellations with multiple meanings. It is a respectful way to call an old man the (old) leader of a house. It doesn’t have to be blood-related.]</p>
 <p>“Jian Grandfather?” Li Qiye glanced at the house and casually asked: “What is his name?”</p>
 <p>This made it a bit difficult for the old man. He chuckled and replied: “Sir, did you make your dao debut recently? You don’t know the name of Grandfather? I am only a junior so I don’t dare to say his name.”</p>
 <p>“A name is just that.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “As long as your heart holds respect, there’s no need to adhere to such rigid formalities.”</p>
 <p>The old man hesitated for a moment before answering: “Grandfather is called Jian Longwei. His Venerableness has led the Jian Clan for several thousand years and is loved by all.”</p>
 <p>“Longwei, I see.” Li Qiye lightly said after hearing the name: “It isn’t easy for a Jian disciple to have such a name. It can’t be given at birth.” [2. Longwei = Dragon Protector. A name matters a lot in China, so cool name = cool character, most of the time.]</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Li Qiye in astonishment but refrained from commenting.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei was a name full of clout in Heaven Spirit. He was the current master of the Jian Clan and had been in charge for several thousand years. His status was equal to a supreme Godking.</p>
 <p>His 8,000th birthday was almost here. At that time, many big shots from all over the world would come to Dragonwell to give him their blessings.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was another meaning to his name. Just like Li Qiye said, it wasn’t a name that could be bestowed upon birth.</p>
 <p>While Li Qiye continued to eat his tofu, a youth came out of the Jian Clan and sat down in the shop as well.</p>
 <p>This youth was very handsome in his violet robe. One could see his bulging muscles underneath them as they exuded a robust feel. However, his strength was not that of a brute but rather a refined type of power.</p>
 <p>The youth spoke with a smile: “Uncle, boiled tofu again. I love this dish of yours.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, coming up.” The old man smiled and got busy again.</p>
 <p>He then brought a bowl for the youth. The fella wasn’t reserved at all and dug in right away. It only took him three to five bites to finish the entire bowl.</p>
 <p>After heaving a satisfying belch, he finally noticed Li Qiye inside the shop.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1247: Jian Xiaotie</b></p>
 <p>While watching Li Qiye’s unhurried manner of eating, the youth couldn’t help but praise: “Brother, you really know how to savor the delicious flavors. The boiled tofu here is really just too good, but I finish way too fast; I’m just a cow chewing on the peony.” [1. Idiom meaning a person is unable to appreciate a delicacy or something more exquisite while they're having it. An English equivalent is casting pearls before swine.]</p>
 <p>“A peony-chewing cow is also a type of happiness.” Li Qiye chuckled while looking at the youth. [2. He is saying ignorance is bliss here.]</p>
 <p>The youth gave a hearty laugh in response: “Brother, you are quite funny. My name is Jian Xiaotie, what is yours?”</p>
 <p>Jiao Xiaotie was a famous name across the Dragon Demon Sea. He was the clan’s young successor.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye answered flatly and continued eating.</p>
 <p>After hearing the name, Jian Xiaotie was quite surprised and immediately stood up while cupping his fists: “Brother Li, the successor of Peacock Land, your prestigious name has been spread far and wide recently.”</p>
 <p>“You mean my notoriety?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile freely.</p>
 <p>The youth chuckled and replied: “Notoriety is cool too. The Peacock Treefather’s supreme resolution and your unrelenting ways are admirable.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye kept smiling. To him, it wasn’t a big deal if the world continued to think that the blood ceremony was the treefather’s idea.</p>
 <p>“It is quite rare to meet another human outside of our clan in Rainbow City, let alone the successor of Peacock Land.” Jian Xiaotie was very excited: “Brother Li, why not come and visit our clan? Our Grandfather’s birthday celebration is in a few more days. At that time, I will take you to see him. He likes young prodigies the most.”</p>
 <p>For the younger generation in Heaven Spirit, meeting Jian Longwei was a great honor since he was a very famous Godking in the present times.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t comment any further. Nevertheless, Jian Xiaotie’s enthusiasm didn’t diminish. He quickly handed an invitation card over and said in a serious manner: “This little brother is sincerely inviting you to our Grandfather’s birthday celebration.”</p>
 <p>As the main successor, Jian Xiaotie was responsible for preparing his ancestor’s feast. However, he only personally gave invitations to big shots.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie handing one over to Li Qiye himself was enough to show his sincerity.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and accepted the invitation. He finished eating his tofu and paid the bill. He looked at the Jian Clan one last time and softly sighed before leaving.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie watched Li Qiye’s departing back and enthusiastically shouted at him: “Brother Li, you must attend!”</p>
 <p>After Li Qiye was long gone, the old man in the shop spoke: “That person is not simple at all.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, a flash appeared in his eyes. He no longer looked like an ordinary shopkeeper.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie smilingly said: “Senior Uncle, he is the successor of Peacock Land, a tree controller. Of course he is not simple; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been chosen by an invincible treefather. Him being in charge of Peacock Land is beneficial to the human race since they will have another sanctuary in Heaven Spirit.”</p>
 <p>“No, Xiaotie, that’s not what I meant.” The old man shook his head: “He said something that no outsiders should know: that our Grandfather’s name was not given at birth. No one should know this outside of people from the Giant Dragon Kingdom! However, he is definitely not from there.”</p>
 <p>“Did he really say that?” Jian Xiaotie was startled as well.</p>
 <p>His eyes became quite profound, indicating he was an incredible master. The old man gently shook his head as he slowly revealed: “Grandfather is renowned across the world and everyone knows his name. However, outsiders definitely can’t know that his name was bestowed to him later on.”</p>
 <p>“That’s not possible.” Jian Xiaotie replied: “Our clan absolutely wouldn’t tell this to outsiders. The brothers from the Giant Dragon Kingdom don’t mingle with outsiders either — their ancestors are very strict about this. Our clan and their clan, even the most naughty little dragons wouldn’t let this secret out.”</p>
 <p>“That’s why I said this person is not simple. He definitely knows something, he didn’t only come here to eat my boiled tofu.” The old man became quite cautious.</p>
 <p>“Maybe the Peacock Treefather told him.” Jian Xiaotie mused: “The treefather was definitely invincible when he was alive so he might know some of our secrets. After all, Li Qiye is still the Peacock Tree Controller.”</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid it isn’t that simple.” The old man lightly shook his head again: “Even the treefather might not have known our secrets. After all, he died long ago. I’m not sure such knowledge can be passed down either.”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie pondered for a moment before replying: “Uncle, even if he didn’t only come here to eat, it doesn’t mean that he has malicious intentions. Our Jian Clan has always been friendly with rest of the human race.”</p>
 <p>The old man spoke: “It is better to be careful. If anything happens during Grandfather’s celebration, then we would be letting Grandfather down as useless juniors.”</p>
 <p>“I will be careful.” Jian Xiaotie nodded earnestly.</p>
 <p>After leaving the little shop, Li Qiye headed for the Rainbow Pavilion. In fact, the old man and Jian Xiaotie were overthinking things; he really did only go to eat the boiled tofu. He had no intention to do anything to the Jian Clan.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took out the invitation and murmured: “Maybe I should go take a look. It will be our last meeting, there might not be another chance in the future...”</p>
 <p>After entering the inn, he found that Zhang Baitu had already taken care of everything.</p>
 <p>“You have just learned a dao, so stay here for now and carefully ponder it.” Li Qiye ordered: “After a few more days, I will take you to the Jian Clan. It will be good for you to get to know the disciples there.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you want to attend the Jian Grandfather’s birthday?” Zhang Baitu was surprised to hear this. Normally, a nobody like him wouldn’t be qualified to attend a celebration of this level.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it will be good to broaden your horizons.” Li Qiye insipidly said: “Your three clans have deep ties with the Jian Clan. However, some unfilial descendants dragged down Dongting Lake, so the Jian Clan wanted nothing to do with you all.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at Zhang Baitu and continued: “Remember this, as a descendant of the Zhang Clan, cultivation is only one aspect, you need to maintain a certain state of mind as well. Remember, if you want to be accepted by others, cultivation alone won’t be enough. You need to have the same resolution as your ancestors. Otherwise, it would be throwing away their past glory and shaming their reputation.”</p>
 <p>“This lowly one will continue to work towards your goals. I won’t let you down.” Zhang Baitu kneeled and answered respectfully.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded quietly.</p>
 <p>While these two were staying at the inn, Dragonwell became even more lively. Its streets could only be described as being occupied by a sea of people.</p>
 <p>This was because Jian Longwei’s 8,000th birthday was coming up. Many great powers from all corners of the world sent their important characters to give him their blessings.</p>
 <p>His pivotal status and the respect he garnered from all the races in Heaven Spirit was not only because he was the leader of the Jian Clan, he was also a Godking. Some even say that he was at the incredible Celestial Godking level.</p>
 <p>Great lineages such as Gu Chun’s four branches, the Seven Martial Pavilion, and the Swiftdao Holy Ground all sent people as well. A few guests garnered a lot of attention. For example, Shangguan Feiyan from the Roaring Conch and Gongsun Meiyu from the Profound Sea Dynasty. People couldn’t turn their eyes away.</p>
 <p>Today, both of these supreme beauties with deep friendships came together. Their appearance at the birthday celebration in Dragonwell created a very pretty scene when they walked together.</p>
 <p>The public praised them as magnificent head-turners. Shangguan Feiyan was very famous at the Dragon Demon Sea for being a genius of the Roaring Conch. Needless to say more about Gongsun Meiyu, she was the Profound Monarch’s concubine. Her charm seeped deep into the bones.</p>
 <p>The crowd started cheering when they presented their gifts.</p>
 <p>“Miss Shangguan represents the Roaring Conch in gifting a Phoenix Conch in honor of the Grandfather.” A disciple responsible for accepting gifts accepted the item and recorded it down.</p>
 <p>“Miss Gongsun represents the God-Monarch in gifting a Longevity Seadeer in honor of the Grandfather.” After hearing the announcement from this disciple, many in the audience marveled.</p>
 <p>“The Phoenix Conch and Longevity Seadeer are both exceedingly rare treasures.” Some were quite envious of the two gifts.</p>
 <p>They felt that only behemoths like the Roaring Conch and Profound Sea Dynasty would be able to afford such gifts.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for the generous presents.” Jian Xiaotie personally received the two girls.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1248: Hong Tianzhu</b></p>
 <p>While Li Qiye was still at the Rainbow Pavilion, Zhang Baitu was striking while the iron was hot in order to comprehend the grand dao he saw earlier.</p>
 <p>Of course, Li Qiye was not in a rush to attend the birthday celebration. It was not his main purpose for coming here.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao came as well. Her father was with her, along with some disciples from the lake. He was the current master of the lake, Hong Tianzhu. [1. Tianzhu = Celestial/Heavenly Pillar.]</p>
 <p>Despite his domineering name, he was not a tall or muscular man. White hair could already be found on his head. Despite his humble stature, he gave off a shrewd and capable feeling instead of looking like a pushover.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li, this is my father.” Hong Yujiao introduced him to Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was sitting in the lobby and only nodded. He didn’t bother to stand up after seeing Hong Tianzhu. Hong Tianzhu cupped his fists and said: “Virtuous Nephew, your fame is thunderous. It is a type of fate to be able to see you today.”</p>
 <p>At this time, Hong Yujiao left with the other disciples because she knew her father wanted to talk to Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>However, before she could leave, Li Qiye interrupted: “Yujiao, stay behind. You need to listen as well.”</p>
 <p>She was slightly dazed and looked over at her father before deciding to stay behind.</p>
 <p>In just a moment, only the three of them were left in the lobby.</p>
 <p>After everyone sat down, Li Qiye looked at Hong Tianzhu and spoke: “I heard Yujiao say that you wanted to meet me to talk about something. What is it about?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu carefully took a glimpse at Li Qiye again. The guy was sitting there imperiously as if he was guarding the entire world. Anyone would feel an uncomfortable vibe after seeing Li Qiye’s attitude. After all, he was only a junior, yet he was so arrogant. Not too many would appreciate this kind of gesture.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to think too much.” Li Qiye broke the silence: “Don’t think that I would give you more consideration just because you are the current master of Dongting Lake. I granted you this audience not because of how strong your lake is, but purely because of the blessing of your ancestors. I’m here to give Dongting Lake a chance.”</p>
 <p>Such words would drive many people away in exasperation. After all, Hong Tianzhu was the leader of an entire region. He enjoyed a great status with his position, but today, someone told him that this meeting was only out of respect for his ancestors. This was simply demeaning and humiliating. No one would like to hear such words.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression slightly shifted after hearing Li Qiye. It would be a lie to say that he was unaffected by these claims. However, as an experienced leader, he didn’t become angry and feel the need to defend his prestige.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li, I respect your status and your character.” Even Hong Yujiao had to defend her father: “But please, show some respect to us and our Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>Her displeasure was warranted. He might as well be pointing straight at her father’s face and criticizing him. As his daughter, she naturally had to uphold his dignity.</p>
 <p>“Yujiao, the fact that I am sitting right here is showing respect to both you two and your Dongting Lake!” Li Qiye opened his eyes wider. A brilliance instantly blossomed like the flashing of a star. The world floated around his divine throne that loomed above the nine heavens.</p>
 <p>He glared at her and slowly uttered: “You think I would bother to correct some randoms on the street and give them a chance at a fortune?”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao was shaken when Li Qiye glared at her like this. Even though he was only sitting there, she felt an immense pressure, rendering her breathless and giving her the urge to prostrate before him. This was a very strange feeling.</p>
 <p>She heaved a sigh of relief once he took his eyes away. The suppressive atmosphere slowly dispersed and she woke up from this trance.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t believe it. This Li Qiye ahead looked even younger than her. Despite his ordinary appearance, he could actually instill a primal fear in her, like an eternal existence.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu took a deep breath and subdued his displeasure. He cupped his fists again and said: “Virtuous Nephew, the truth is that I did come here today with a particular topic in mind.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly replied: “Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu paused for a moment before speaking: “You are the disciple of the Peacock Treefather, the current successor of Peacock Land. My Dongting Lake wishes to formalize a pact with your land.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slightly raised his eyebrows and asked: “A pact?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu elaborated: “With your consent, we will send disciples to Peacock Land to start a training garrison so that they can become accustomed to the mainland. This will also deepen the friendship between our two lands. Of course, you can also send disciples to my Dongting Lake so that they can train and get used to the sea as well.”</p>
 <p>Even though Dongting Lake was huge, its actual landmass was far smaller than Peacock Land. There were more lakes than anything else here. Meanwhile, Peacock Land was one of the biggest continents in not just the Jade Sea, but the entire Heaven Spirit World. There was a reason why it was considered such a great haven for the human race.</p>
 <p>However, despite its great size, Peacock Land has never allowed outsiders to be stationed within its territory. No one dared to challenge the Peacock Treefather’s authority in this regard either.</p>
 <p>“There are not many humans in Heaven Spirit. Our Dongting Lake and your Peacock Land are two of the biggest strongholds of our race. You should know that if we cooperate with each other, it will not only be beneficial for our lands, but also for the entire human race.” He finished his suggestion.</p>
 <p>“I am actually not an acrimonious person.” Li Qiye said with an indifferent tone: “But you yourself should be laughing at how ridiculous your statement is. Your clans have been vying for power all this time, scheming for all kinds of positions. Don’t you think its funny when your lake talks about the interests of the human race?”</p>
 <p>“You can’t even tolerate and accept your own people, what is this talk about helping others?!” He coldly stared at Hong Tianzhu after stating this.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s face turned red to the point of being slightly ugly after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li, you are speaking out of line.” Hong Yujiao once more interjected on her father’s behalf.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shifted his glare to her and responded: “Your Dongting Lake needs to reflect on this issue. Go back and tell those old geezers there what I have said today. I initially didn’t want to talk about this kind of nonsense as it's not even worth a fart in my eyes!”</p>
 <p>His glare was chilling at this moment: “However, I will give your lake a chance out of respect for your ancestors. Go back and tell those old bones that if they don’t wake up, I will personally take action!”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu rose from his seat and lowered his voice: “Young Noble Li, your words are too condescending. My lake will take care of our own business. If you do not wish to befriend us, then forget it. Goodbye.”</p>
 <p>“Sit down!” The glint in Li Qiye’s eyes bloomed. An oppressive atmosphere came from his eyes; it was as if they could annihilate eternity itself. Hong Tianzhu seemed to be imprisoned by gods from the glare.</p>
 <p>He involuntarily sat back down with a bang as if a hand of god had directly pushed him down.</p>
 <p>“You still don’t understand.” Li Qiye continued his scolding: “Do you really think the phrase “protected by the wise sages of the Hundred-Saints Hall” is merely empty words? When was the last time you all visited and worshiped the souls of your ancestors?”</p>
 <p>“The wise sages of the Hundred-Saints Hall?” He couldn’t come up with an answer right away, but he knew of this particular phrase.</p>
 <p>“Forget it.” Li Qiye gently sighed: “I am too lazy to care about you all. If you want to work together with Peacock Land, I will show you the way by writing a letter to Kong Qinru of the Exquisite Valley. She will make the necessary arrangements for you.”</p>
 <p>“The Exquisite Valley Lord?” Hong Tianzhu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know the relationship between Li Qiye and Kong Qinru. In theory, Li Qiye was the successor of Peacock Land, so he should be in charge of this business.</p>
 <p>“Go, Qinru will assist you.” Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve.</p>
 <p>He was tired of this problem with Dongting Lake. Only his love for their ancestors kept him involved.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu hesitated and asked: “Well, will the Exquisite Valley agree to assist us in this matter?” He felt that he by himself was not enough to deal with the valley.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but look at him and ask: “Don’t tell me you haven’t been communicating with the Exquisite Valley?”</p>
 <p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu rubbed his palms together awkwardly and replied: “Our Dongting Lake do have some dealings with the Exquisite Valley, but, but it is only by chance most of the time.”</p>
 <p>He became a bit embarrassed at this point and didn’t know what else to say.</p>
 <p></p>

 <a href="/novel/emperors-domination/emperor-chapter-1249" class="chapter-nav"> Next Chapter </a> 
</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1249: Contract</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye noticed Hong Tianzhu’s awkward demeanor and flatly said: “I understand now. You no longer have the contract from back then! It was written by the ancestors from the Zhang Clan, so their withdrawal cut off the alliance between you and the Exquisite Valley!”</p>
 <p>“How do you know that?!” Hong Tianzhu was shocked to hear this. This was a story so ancient that even their lake had almost forgotten about it.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu wouldn’t have recalled this matter if Li Qiye didn’t bring up working together with the Exquisite Valley. Even juniors from the lake didn’t know about this contract, let alone outsiders.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t answer his question directly: “After severing this contract, your lake’s descendants didn’t have the ability to form another one. In the end, the valley stopped caring about your lake.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s old face became a bit hot. He coughed and said: “I, I won’t deny that. Dongting Lake is indeed inferior compared to the past. We descendants have not done well, so the lake isn’t strong like before. This inevitably made others underestimate us.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu sighed after saying this. Suddenly, he felt as if he was one generation below Li Qiye in the hierarchy.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sighed as well and stared at Hong Tianzhu. He couldn’t give up on him, so he pointed the way for him: “The valley didn’t ignore you because of the decline. Even though the Zhang ancestors were the ones who signed the contract, the Hong and Xu ancestors were most likely involved in passing it down as well.”</p>
 <p>“Take a moment to reflect on what your lake has become. The clans are distancing themselves from each other, and all of you have long forgotten the teachings of your ancestors. Today, one clan will be on top, tomorrow, another will take its place. Everything has become such a mess with a total failure to comply with your legacy’s own teachings.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye paused before continuing: “With this abandonment, your sect has become chaotic. All of its energy and resources are consumed by internal conflicts, do you feel that your lake can still be powerful under these conditions?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu was a bit tongue-tied after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“The lake was built upon the labor of all three clans. Without this system that was fortified by an agreement, your group is nothing more than a bunch of stray dogs competing for a piece of meat! Think about it, the continuous changes in leadership in such a capricious manner rendered the entire system useless. Do you think the valley would want to be involved with your lake under these circumstances? Each of your clans has their own agenda while lacking the will to carry out a strategy that will benefit the entire lake as a whole.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Hong Tianzhu didn’t know how to respond.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently sighed: “It is not impossible to form an alliance with the Exquisite Valley. The descendants of your clans need to sit down. Let go of what should be abandoned, do what must be done, follow your lineage’s old teachings and become a solidary whole once more. Repent and more opportunities shall arise.”</p>
 <p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu hesitated. He didn’t know why Li Qiye knew so many things about them, but he was taking Li Qiye much more seriously.</p>
 <p>He eventually said: “Young Noble, this isn’t that simple. Even if I want to reform the union, the other ancestors might not necessarily agree. Moreover, the clans themselves might not be willing to follow the ancestral teachings again.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s remark was not unreasonable. After all, who would be willing to give up their power after being in charge? This was simply asking for the impossible.</p>
 <p>No one could withstand the temptation of power. This was precisely the reason why several generations later, the lake abandoned their teachings and contended over resources and authority. This led to the chaos in the lake and, not long after this, many long-term agreements could no longer be sustained.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly replied: “Let the souls of your ancestors decide in accordance with their ironclad teachings. Kill those who dare to disobey without showing mercy.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu was dazed after hearing this. It sounded like a joke, but he didn’t dare to say it.</p>
 <p>The souls of the ancestors were an intangible and spiritual matter. It was only a way of commemorating the ancestors and their glorious achievements.</p>
 <p>It was impossible to seek these spirits and ask for their arbitration. Who would listen to such an ethereal idea?</p>
 <p>“It seems like you all don’t even know what you have lost.” Li Qiye shook his head and said: “After abandoning your union and contract, even the ancestors have been forgotten. It’s no wonder why the valley looks down on your lake. It has thrown away all of its ancestors’ prestige and even the most precious inheritance they left behind. Why would the valley care about you?”</p>
 <p>“You think that the Hundred-Saints Hall is storing treasures, right?” Li Qiye coldly stared at Hong Tianzhu.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu became quite embarrassed. Some of their ancestors did think that the hall stored treasures. Some of them had even tried to open it to no avail.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye felt a bit helpless at these descendants and told Hong Tianzhu: “Then let me ask you, has your lake been worshiping the souls of the ancestors and the lake itself?”</p>
 <p>“Well…” Hong Tianzhu coughed awkwardly and couldn’t say anything for a long time.</p>
 <p>The frustrated Li Qiye shook his head and said: “I don’t know what to say regarding your stupidity. If I was your ancestor, I would surely strangle you group of fools with only power in your eyes!”</p>
 <p>“Do you actually think that you have been able to defend Dongting Lake because it has a superb defensive terrain with your insignificant strength? Don’t you know how important this treasure ground is? Your ancestors expended countless efforts in order to obtain it. In the Dragon Demon Sea, all of the great lineages like the Seven Martial Pavilion, the Roaring Conch, and the Dream Empyrean could easily destroy the lake whenever they want!”</p>
 <p>He went on to say: “Do you think defending the lake is to your group’s credit? To put it bluntly, the Dream Empyrean’s Meng Zhentian can easily annihilate you all by himself, so why is it that none of them have maneuvered against the lake? Is it because of your few contemporary ancestors? Haha, in the eyes of others, these ancestors are no different from insects.</p>
 <p>“The real reason why your lake has survived till now is due to the souls of your ancestors protecting everyone. Because of them, your enemies do not dare to act recklessly! Without their protection, within this Dragon Demon Sea where the sea demons reign supreme, you ants would have been treated like fat pieces of meat and torn asunder by a group of bloodthirsty sharks!”</p>
 <p>He snorted sarcastically as he finished his monologue: “But today, you have forgotten about their souls! To actually not be performing the lake ceremony as well as worshipping your ancestors… how ridiculous!”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu stood there murmuring to himself: “The souls of the ancestors…?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head again with frustration: “You can’t be thinking that their souls are just an intangible concept?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu smiled wryly and had no response again. Hong Yujiao, sitting to the side, couldn’t comment either because she didn’t know about the souls of the ancestors. As for the teachings and contract, she wasn’t privy to them either. Many of the current elders in the lake didn’t want to mention them.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was their direct ancestors who chose to abandon these rules in favor of power; they naturally wouldn’t want to bring it up again.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu mustered up his courage and asked after some musing: “Young Noble, if we were to let the souls of the ancestors make the decision, how do we go about it?”</p>
 <p>“Do you really have the determination?” Li Qiye looked at him and said: “Right now, your Hong Clan has a lot of power at the lake and the Xu also have several docks, right? The poorest among the clans is the Zhang, they don’t even have a place to stay despite the lake being so large.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu didn’t know too much about the power struggle back then either, but he had heard a few things about it. Even though the Zhang ancestors lost, they still had one dock remaining out of the eighteen. However, these ancestors were furious at that time and chose to leave Dongting Lake. The rest of them then divided the Zhang Clan's assets; this wasn’t a proud event at all.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly looked at him and said: “Will your Hong Clan be willing to give up your power and resources?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu eventually answered: “I don’t know what the ancestors will say, but you are right, our lake is indeed in disarray due to the power struggles. We only do what we want, so many of our covenants and pacts with others can’t be implemented. If this keeps up, the lake will be even more fragmented and become weaker.”</p>
 <p>“I understand after listening to you today.” He gently sighed: “We must be the ones to reshape the order of the lake. Otherwise, no one will respect us.”</p>
 <p>As the master of the lake, he understood that many of their current agreements couldn’t be carried out at all.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1250: Marriage Proposal</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye watched over Hong Tianzhu for a bit before speaking: “Very well, if you are truly sincere, then it will be for the best. I will give your lake one last chance; if you can’t seize it, then you are on your own in the future.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu became excited and quickly bowed: “Thank you, Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>Even though he knew neither what Li Qiye was capable of or about the souls of the ancestors, his intuition was telling him that this was a once-in-a-million-years opportunity for their lake. If they were to miss it, then they would truly be on the verge of a real decline.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao was also confused at this moment. They didn’t know who this man was, but she felt an unfathomable aura from him. When he sat there, it seemed as if he was the master of all. Both she and her father felt their statuses lowered while he would remain the same for all eternity.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked Hong Tianzhu: “Did you come to Dragonwell to celebrate the Jian Clan’s birthday?”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu quickly answered: “Young Noble, you are correct. Our lake was invited for the 8,000th birthday, so we came to give the Jian Grandfather our blessings.”</p>
 <p>“Very well, we’ll go together then. Having an audience with the Grandfather will be good.” Li Qiye gently nodded: “As for whether you can build a friendship with the Jian Clan in the future or not, that will depend on your own fortune.”</p>
 <p>“Meet the Grandfather?” Hong Tianzhu was both excited and nervous. Even though their lake did have some ties with the Jian Clan, it was a very shallow relationship.</p>
 <p>To a large extent, the only reason they were invited to this celebration was most likely because they were also humans.</p>
 <p>Their lake was not qualified to see the Grandfather alone. This was something left to behemoths like the Seven Martial Pavilion and Roaring Conch.</p>
 <p>How could he not be shocked by this development? It was truly a good opportunity for Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, please stop, our master is in a meeting.” The voice of a disciple from the lake came from outside.</p>
 <p>But before this disciple could finish, the person had already barged inside. The intruder was the Wyvern Crown Prince, Shangguan Feilong.</p>
 <p>The disciple outside couldn’t exactly stop him, so they were at an impasse.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu and Hong Yujiao were surprised to see this sudden intrusion and slightly frowned.</p>
 <p>After coming inside, Shangguan Feilong felt annoyed when he saw Li Qiye and snorted. However, he didn’t push it further and decided to ignore Li Qiye. He cupped his fist towards the other two and said: “Uncle, Sister, please excuse my rude interruption, I was simply too anxious.”</p>
 <p>The deed was done, so despite feeling unhappy, Hong Tianzhu managed to ask: “Nephew, is there an important event?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feilong was visually happy. He bowed and carefully spoke: “My big sis wants to invite you to the Jian Clan to talk about the marriage between Sister and me.”</p>
 <p>“What marriage?” Hong Yujiao’s expression shifted.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu grimaced as well and said: “Nephew, this joke is going too far. It is too early to talk about marriage.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle, it isn’t early.” Shangguan Feilong gloated: “My big sis has sent messages to the ancestors of the lake, and they have agreed. Moreover, our marriage will be administered by the Seashield Prince.”</p>
 <p>Both the father and daughter were alarmed upon hearing this sudden development. They couldn’t react in time.</p>
 <p>“The ancestors of the lake have high hopes for this marriage and wish for it to happen soon.” The happy youth spoke: “My big sis heard that Uncle was staying at Dragonwell, so she told me to come and invite you to the Jian Clan to discuss things further.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu raised his brows and asked in a serious manner: “When did the ancestors agree to this?”</p>
 <p>“Just a while ago.” Shangguan Feilong was all smiles: “Sister and I are a perfect match. This marriage is a match made in heaven—”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao coldly interrupted him: “I’ll be in charge of my own marriage, the ancestors don’t need to worry about it.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao was quite dissatisfied with the ancestors from the lake suddenly deciding her marriage for her.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu felt the same way, evident by his grimace. He understood why the ancestors agreed so quickly. To a large extent, it was due to Feilong’s older sister, Shangguan Feiyan.</p>
 <p>She was one of the most excellent geniuses of the Roaring Conch. Plus, there had been rumors of her marrying her senior brother, the Seashield Prince, to become the future mistress of that sect.</p>
 <p>If the lake could form this marriage pact with the Wyvern Country, they would also be able to suck up to the Roaring Conch. It would be very beneficial to have such a strong backing.</p>
 <p>However, he was not happy about this marriage. His daughter had the most excellent bloodline among the lake’s younger generation. He naturally didn’t want their Hong Clan’s best bloodline to go to a foreign race.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feilong quickly responded to Hong Yujiao: “Sister, we are childhood friends. You have the best bloodline while I will inherit the Wyvern Country. Our children will be dragons and phoenixes amongst men, they could even inherit the true dragon’s bloodline from my forefathers…”</p>
 <p>“Since when did the Wyvern Country have a true dragon’s bloodline?” A very blunt voice interrupted Feilong. Li Qiye coldly commented: “A little snake crawling up from the seabed dares to claim to be a true dragon?!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t show Feilong any respect: “The Wyvern Country is nothing. How can it be qualified to marry a daughter from the Hong Clan? When the ancestors from the Hong Clan lorded over the world, your forefather was only a little snake at the bottom of the ocean!”</p>
 <p>“You!” Feilong’s expression became quite unsightly after the hurtful words. He furiously pointed at Li Qiye and spat: “Li, don’t think you’re all that because you're the Peacock Tree’s disciple. It can only be invincible at Peacock Land and will never be able to leave! Without its protection, you are nothing and can be killed at any time!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was too lazy to give him another glance. He stood up and told Hong Yujiao: “Your marriage is for you to decide. Those geezers from the lake are hopelessly stupid; in order to gain a backing, they are willing to give up their best bloodline to a foreign race as a cauldron! Truly a bunch of idiots.”</p>
 <p>“If you want to marry, then do it. If you don’t, then you don’t have to worry about anyone forcing you! Just let me know and I shall deal with them. These other races are not qualified to marry the excellent bloodline of the Hong Clan!” Having said that, he walked towards the door.</p>
 <p>Feilong was enraged by Li Qiye and shouted: “Motherfucker, I dare you to say that again!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored him and left the lobby.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu quickly consoled him: “Nephew, a marriage is a happy event, but it is also very important. Wait until I come back and talk to the ancestors to figure things out, then I’ll meet your sister. Of course, I’ll probably see her at the birthday celebration anyway.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle, after this feast, my sister will be going back to the Roaring Conch. She wants to arrange the marriage before leaving.” Feilong had to ignore Li Qiye and replied to Hong Tianzhu: “If this can be done, she can also invite the Seashield Prince to preside over our wedding.”</p>
 <p>“I understand your eagerness as well as Miss Shangguan’s line of thought.” Hong Tianzhu was conflicted. The ancestors didn’t bother talking to him before deciding his daughter’s marriage.</p>
 <p>He continued to appease Feilong: “Don’t worry, I will give your sister a definite answer before she leaves.”</p>
 <p>It took a while before Tianzhu managed to calm Feilong down and send him away.</p>
 <p>“The ancestors are too unreasonable. How can they make a decision about my marriage like this!” Hong Yujiao expressed her dissatisfaction after Feilong’s departure.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu sighed and insipidly said: “Do you still not see it? There is only one reason why the ancestors from our Hong and Xu Clans could reach an agreement in such a short amount of time. Even though we have a lot of power in the lake right now, several of our Hong ancestors are near the end of their lifespans. If they die, then the Xu Clan will have a chance to close the gap. The Roaring Conch is the most powerful lineage right now with a great amount of divine medicine. If I’m not mistaken, the ancestors must have reached an agreement with Shangguan Feiyan; they want to use this marriage to trade for some medicine!”</p>
 <p>He sighed helplessly after coming to this conclusion.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1251: Bloodshark Scion</b></p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao felt gloomy after hearing her father.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu continued his explanation while feeling frustrated: “As for the ancestors from the Xu Clan, it is pretty easy to guess why they are in favor of this marriage. Among the younger generations, your bloodline is the most exceptional with the highest chance for atavism! If you stay at the lake, you will have a better chance than anyone else to inherit my mantle and become the next master of the lake…”</p>
 <p>“... As you can imagine, if our Hong Clan were to stay in power, the other clans will not be happy. This is why they were able to reach an agreement about the marriage proposal so quickly!” He sighed after finishing his explanation.</p>
 <p>She voiced her displeasure: “Our ancestors are too outrageous. I am not an object!”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu continued with a hint of helplessness: “Despite being together, our clans have always sought power. It has been many years since we were last united. Young Noble Li was right about why others look down on us. Our clans are not doing a good job of operating the lake; everyone is only after their own interests and small gains.”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps this is the time for us to change. Otherwise, we will die from infighting before an enemy has the chance to destroy us.” His eyes became determined after stating this.</p>
 <p>She worriedly responded: “Father, I’m afraid the ancestors will not agree to reuniting our clans and obeying our past teachings. Even our own ancestors won’t allow you to do so.”</p>
 <p>“I know.” Tianzhu gently sighed: “But what else can we do? Do we keep on watching the internal struggle until our demise?”</p>
 <p>He lowered his tone here: “As for the marriage, I will personally discuss it with them. Their actions were too unreasonable this time…”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he contemplated quietly for a while.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>A few days passed in the blink of an eye. Zhang Baitu had finally comprehended his own dao and was overjoyed by his success. Not even in his wildest dreams did he imagine that such a day would come.</p>
 <p>He left his closed cultivation since the birthday celebration was swiftly approaching. Together with Li Qiye, he went to the Jian Clan along with Hong Tianzhu, Hong Yujiao, and some disciples from the lake.</p>
 <p>At this time, Dragonwell City was quite lively. People crowded together along the streets. This was especially true for the Jian Mansion. Carriages were everywhere with people coming and going.</p>
 <p>Guests from all over the seas came to wish happy birthday to the Jian Grandfather. Even imperial lineages created by sea gods and Immortal Emperors were no exceptions.</p>
 <p>Before arriving at the mansion, Li Qiye’s group met Feilong along the way. It seemed that he intended to walk together with them.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, Sister.” Feilong cupped his fists and greeted them while only giving a cold humph towards Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He didn’t wish to provoke Li Qiye this time. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Li Qiye even though Li Qiye was the disciple of the Peacock Tree. After all, his big sis was the genius of the Roaring Conch, so his backing was quite amazing as well.</p>
 <p>This time, he was accompanied by another young man. This young man had a stout stature with a sharp pair of eyes. There seemed to be an ethereal bloody mist hovering around him.</p>
 <p>Feilong introduced him: “Uncle, this is the Bloodshark Scion, you probably recognize him.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao and the rest of the lake’s disciples trembled a bit. The Bloodshark Village was very famous in the Heaven Spirit World. Moreover, it was right next to the Wyvern Country.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, it was more powerful than Wyvern. Wyvern was relatively milder in their conduct while this village was notorious for its cruelty. They often attacked smaller factions.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, one of its ancestors was the Bloodshark Sovereign, a very terrifying existence. Rumor has it that in his youth, he was once recognized by the Trident. However, for some unknown reason, the Trident abandoned him so he ultimately couldn’t become a sea god.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, his status at the Dragon Demon Sea was still untouchable. Other great powers had no desire to provoke him.</p>
 <p>“Sect Master Hong, nice to meet you. In the future, we will be in-laws. Your lake’s problems will be my Bloodshark Village’s problems.” This scion was even more arrogant than Feilong as he cupped his fists and smiled.</p>
 <p>“In-laws? Why do you say that?” Hong Tianzhu furrowed his brows. It seemed like many interesting events were happening all at once.</p>
 <p>Feilong was the one who answered: “Uncle, you haven’t heard yet, but the Lin Clan has betrothed their golden daughter to him.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression sank after hearing this. He was left in the dark despite being the sect master. It looked like the Lin Clan didn’t want to let the other clans know about it.</p>
 <p>He also understood that they did this in order to oppose the Hong Clan. If, say, his daughter was to actually marry Shangguan Feilong, then it wouldn’t only be a marriage with Wyvern, they would also gain the favor of the Roaring Conch.</p>
 <p>This marriage was a source of worry for the other clans at Dongting Lake. Because of this, the Lin Clan, a sect relatively close to the lake, was the first to have a marriage alliance with the Bloodshark Village.</p>
 <p>He secretly lamented after realizing this. Many clans didn’t even hesitate to cooperate with outsiders for power.</p>
 <p>At this time, the scion’s eyes fell upon a female disciple. Even though she couldn’t be described as kingdom-toppling, she still grew up to be quite beautiful with a graceful bearing like an orchid in a valley.</p>
 <p>His eyes lit up right away as he stared in an overbearing and rude manner.</p>
 <p>“You must be Sister Lin. We shall be a great couple after getting married.” The scion laughed and said: “You have a holy bloodline while I have a sea god’s bloodline. Our marriage will be a perfect matrimony.”</p>
 <p>This scion was proving to be even more arrogant and overbearing than Shangguan Feilong.</p>
 <p>For this trip, Hong Tianzhu brought along the most excellent disciples among the younger generation. He wanted them to get to know the youths from the Jian Clan.</p>
 <p>This miss with the surname Lin was a brilliant disciple. At this time, the scion’s stare caused her discomfort. She couldn’t help but hide behind Hong Yujiao.</p>
 <p>The scion’s words were quite imposing. He spoke as if she was already his incubator, angering the other disciples. Alas, they didn’t dare to speak up.</p>
 <p>The scion ignored the glares from these disciples and remained haughty as he dismissively said: “This marriage is very beneficial to your Dongting Lake. This is the lake’s honor.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu snorted at this comment, but he remained calm.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye who was watching indifferently on the sideline couldn’t help but shake his head. These foolish ancestors from the clans back at Dongting Lake were incurable. They didn’t mind working together with outsiders to grab power. This was the same as inviting wolves to their own home!</p>
 <p>Such a hungry wolf was standing before them, evidenced by his invasive gaze at the young lady from the Lin Clan. The Bloodshark Scion smiled and said: “After the celebration, you should come with me to the Bloodshark Village. I’ll take you to see our customs.”</p>
 <p>The young girl was still hiding behind Hong Yujiao while feeling disgusted by the scion’s eyes that resembled those of a hungry wolf. She felt both angry and helpless because her own ancestors had betrothed her to the village!</p>
 <p>At this time, Li Qiye began again with an insipid tone: “Bloodshark Village? Only a lowly race that enjoys feasting on rotten corpses. It took you forever to be able to come out of the water, yet you are here acting all pompous? Your lowly race is not qualified to marry one of my people! Scram to the side!”</p>
 <p>Despite his initial stance of not caring for Dongting Lake, he couldn’t bear to watch any longer. He had decided to personally rectify the problems those foolish ancestors had caused Dongting Lake!</p>
 <p>His comment came to Miss Lin’s rescue. Many disciples felt quite pleased to hear it because they couldn’t speak out against the order of their ancestors.</p>
 <p>The Bloodshark Scion became heated right away. He turned around and coldly exclaimed: “You are that brat, the disciple of the Peacock Tree? It isn’t here right now, so don’t think you cannot be offended! Anyone can kill you right now!”</p>
 <p>A chilling glint flashed across his eyes after issuing the threat.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye suddenly smiled back. This was a smile that made Hong Tianzhu’s heart skip a beat. He suddenly felt an ominous foreboding because he had heard of the blood ceremony that Li Qiye and the treefather carried out.</p>
 <p>“Let us go to the Jian Mansion.” He quickly interjected in order to remind both the scion and Li Qiye.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1252: Birthday Celebration</b></p>
 <p>Shangguan Feilong also stopped the Bloodshark Scion from fighting and quickly added: “Scion, there’s no need to bother with a scoundrel like this. It will only ruin the mood of the Grandfather’s birthday, that wouldn’t be good.”</p>
 <p>The scion glanced at the Jian Mansion not too far away and grunted to call it a day. Everyone had to be reserved at the Jian Mansion.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, his head is already claimed.” Feilong grinned and told Li Qiye: “We won’t bother with you for now, but don’t be happy for long. Queen Gongsun has already claimed your head. She has released a message about taking your head to sacrifice to her maid!”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao and the rest of the disciples from the lake were aghast. Even Hong Tianzhu was a little stirred. He naturally knew who Queen Gongsun was; as the concubine of the Profound God-Monarch, her backing was the monstrous Profound Dynasty.</p>
 <p>“Who the hell is she?” Li Qiye didn’t even bat an eye and simply didn’t take it to heart.</p>
 <p>The rest of his group had no comments. The guy was too domineering. Among the younger generation, who would dare to make such a remark about Gongsun Meiyu?</p>
 <p>“Haha, ignorant fool. No one will be able to save you once the queen is here.” Feilong smiled deviously.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was him who told Meiyu about Li Qiye’s presence at Dragonwell. If Meiyu wasn’t preoccupied with meeting the big characters from the Jian Clan, she would have already tried to take his head as revenge for her maid, Gongsun Qianer.</p>
 <p>“Gentlemen, we are here.” Hong Tianzhu noticed the sparks in the air and quickly interrupted them when they made it to the entrance.</p>
 <p>The Jian disciples were welcoming guests. These disciples were very knowledgeable and quickly greeted the group: “Master Hong, Bloodshark Scion, welcome to our humble abode…”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu returned the gesture. Even the Bloodshark Scion didn’t dare to act presumptuously before the Jian Clan. He politely conversed with these disciples. As for Feilong, he had been here already to deliver his gift, so he was very familiar with these disciples.</p>
 <p>While the others were talking with the Jian disciples, Miss Lin came next to Li Qiye and whispered: “Thank you for earlier.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took a look at this gentle girl and noticed her slightly embarrassed demeanor. He sighed in his mind.</p>
 <p>In the past, these clans were completely united under one legion. Their battalions formed by their disciples once threatened the world with many great expeditions. Part of their prestige came from their integrity and open-mindedness which attracted many human experts to join them.</p>
 <p>However, many years have passed and their descendants suffer from internal conflicts. They were now fish on the chopping block in the eyes of many!</p>
 <p>While Li Qiye was recalling the past, the young lady reminded him: “Let’s go inside.”</p>
 <p>The rest of the group that were talking to the Jian disciples earlier had already entered. The remaining disciples from the lake followed them inside as well.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye and Miss Lin walked up the steps. While standing beneath the entrance, Li Qiye looked up to look at the plaque. It was a very simple wooden board with the word “Jian” written on it. It contained an extraordinary divinity.</p>
 <p>That happy and outgoing smile with a hint of craftiness always accompanied her laughter. This laughter was too difficult to forget, always ringing in his ears when he looked at the plaque.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, the ruler of the universe and adjudicator of the Heaven’s Will, how about leaving behind a word to protect my Jian Clan’s descendants?” The wily girl blinked with a pair of wise eyes that seemed like they could speak. She smiled and continued: “I won’t ask for you to protect them, only that if one day, our descendants blindly maneuver against you, you will think about this character “Jian” and spare their lives.”</p>
 <p>The past seemed like it was just yesterday. Her unforgettable voice and posture still lingered in his heart. He gently sighed while looking at the word on the plaque and thought to himself: “Little girl, why did you have to try so hard back then? All of that just to scheme for little Hong Tian. If I wanted to obtain my body from the Immortal Demon Grotto, I would have done so long ago.”</p>
 <p>During his melancholic reminiscence, Hong Tianzhu had presented his gift. It was not a stunning present, but it also didn’t throw away the lake’s reputation. It was right around the middle of the pack.</p>
 <p>The Bloodshark Scion also presented a treasure box with a blood pearl inside. He was very proud of his present and stated: “My ancestors can’t personally come to wish Senior Jian a happy birthday, so they allowed me to bring this Bloodshark Divine Pearl as a gift instead. Please excuse us for the little gift that doesn’t show our full sincerity.”</p>
 <p>Despite saying this, he had a complacent demeanor. After all, this was an exceedingly rare divine pearl. It was not easy to come up with such a treasure.</p>
 <p>The guests were marveling at this priceless gift.</p>
 <p>“One Bloodshark Divine Pearl.” However, the old man receiving the presents had a relatively flat reaction and only recorded it on the list.</p>
 <p>The Jian Clan was a wondrous existence with a deep foundation. The old man receiving presents had seen pretty much every kind of treasure. This was only one divine pearl, so of course his reaction was dull.</p>
 <p>The gloating scion felt a bit lost after seeing the lack of reaction. He felt a bit of remorse as well because this pearl was still considered very precious for their village. But now, this old man from the Jian Clan was treating it like an ordinary piece of candy. This made him feel quite uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>A disciple noticed that Li Qiye was standing by the door in a daze and quickly asked: “This is… Who might you be, Sir?”</p>
 <p>“Heh, his name is Li Qiye from Peacock Land. Who knows if he was actually invited to the Jian Grandfather’s birthday or not?” The Bloodshark Scion was annoyed, so he used this opportunity to intentionally lower Li Qiye’s standing.</p>
 <p>“So you are Young Noble Li from Peacock Land, I have heard of your great fame.” The Jian disciple was not a frog at the bottom of a well, so he immediately cupped his fists to greet Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at the scion who was trying to debase him and casually handed over the invitation given to him by Jian Xiaotie.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li, please come inside.” The disciple quickly led him to the main hall.</p>
 <p>The scion who wanted to mock Li Qiye had to stop after seeing the invitation and could only snort instead.</p>
 <p>After being taken to the reception area, Li Qiye didn’t say much and only handed a wooden box to the old man.</p>
 <p>This box was very ordinary looking, as if it was a random and inconspicuous container for a regular birthday present.</p>
 <p>“Oh? This is your present?” The Bloodshark Scion sneered and commented with disdain: “I heard your Peacock Land has no disciples other than a hoodlum like you, so I guess it is understandable for such a weak lineage. Don’t tell me you plucked a few leaves from the Peacock Tree and brought them here as a present for the Grandfather?”</p>
 <p>“Brother Bloodshark, you shouldn’t be so demanding. After the calamity, Peacock Land has been stricken with poverty. One must remember that sincerity is more important than gifts. Just a few leaves are more than enough.” Shangguan Feilong smiled and added fuel to the fire.</p>
 <p>These two had grievances towards Li Qiye, so they held nothing back in their remarks.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored the two and told the old man in a flat tone: “A ginseng root, decent for longevity replenishment.”</p>
 <p>The old man’s face changed as he immediately opened the wooden box. A rich and incomparable ginseng fragrance dispersed. As people smelled this scent, their blood energies suddenly erupted. The older cultivators felt like they were dozens of years younger.</p>
 <p>A ginseng root was placed in this ordinary box. The entire section was as red as blood with a flowing purple glow, making it resemble a piece of jade. It seemed that this particular root had its own life.</p>
 <p>The old man couldn’t help but exclaim in shock: “A Violet Blood Ginseng King! The root of an ancestor ginseng!” Despite his great experience, he was still shaken all the same. This was not something comparable to several million years old medicines. This was an immortal medicine!</p>
 <p>Even just a small section had an unbelievable worth. For many cultivators, this little piece alone could prolong their life for a long time. Numerous older masters dreamed of such an item!</p>
 <p>“An ancestor ginseng!” Some of the guests were astounded and quickly circled around to take a look.</p>
 <p>“This is my first time seeing an immortal item like this.” A great power’s ancestor was shocked and had saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Immortal medicine, amazing. This is something that can only be obtained with great fortune, how many people have actually seen an immortal medicine in their lifetime?” Astonishment was the common reaction for these guests.</p>
 <p>“This is an item exclusive to Godkings.” No one dared to have any ill thoughts about it since only Godkings could use an item of this level.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu and the other disciples from the lake were aghast at this inconceivable gift.</p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1253: Jian Clan</b></p>
 <p>This ginseng root amazed the spectators. The violet glow on its red body made it look like a priceless treasure to just about anyone.</p>
 <p>Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion were embarrassed by this root. Their expressions became quite ugly. They were laughing at Li Qiye earlier, but now, this ginseng root was a ruthless slap to their faces, leaving them with no room for retort.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was not Li Qiye trying to show off. In terms of status, the Jian Grandfather was still his junior. Giving this root to prolong his life was only a greeting gift for a junior.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie hurried out at this time. He was talking to his guest inside the mansion, but as soon as he heard from a disciple, he ran outside right away. A ginseng root was still considered a grand gesture to their clan, so he had to personally greet Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, thank you for the generous gift.” He cupped his fists right away and said: “I thank you on behalf of our Grandfather.”</p>
 <p>This root was quite crucial to the Grandfather since he was already eight thousand years old. It could prolong his life by at least one hundred years.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye just nodded and lightly said: “Don’t mention it, just a small gift.”</p>
 <p>This nonchalant attitude made some of the guests stare at the Bloodshark Scion and Shangguan Feilong. Earlier, the scion was gloating after presenting a Bloodshark Divine Pearl and mocked Li Qiye in the process. But now, Li Qiye’s ginseng root was countless times more precious than the pearl, yet Li Qiye still acted normally. The difference in the two’s worth became clear with a glance.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, Master Hong, and fellow daoists, please come inside.” Jian Xiaotie noticed that Li Qiye was together with Hong Tianzhu’s group, so he busily invited them in.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu and the disciples brightened up after being personally invited by Xiaotie, the successor of the Jian Clan. Even though he rarely showed himself, his status was great. Normally, he would only greet guests from imperial lineages or sea gods’ sects.</p>
 <p>Thus, they felt respected after receiving this gesture from him.</p>
 <p>As they were leaving, they walked by the Bloodshark Scion. Li Qiye only gave him a quick glance and stated: “This divine pearl is just a piece of crap. I would only use them to decorate the pen of livestock, it’s not worth a single coin.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye never took it easy on those who opposed him and left no room for conciliation. No one else dared to interfere with this personal grievance between the two.</p>
 <p>The scion’s face reddened with anger after hearing this. He scowled and left right away. Feilong followed right after him. Staying any longer would only result in further humiliation.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie noticed the atmosphere and tried to change the topic: “Brother Li, this is your first time at our home. If you and everyone else don’t mind, how about a tour?”</p>
 <p>Despite already being familiar with the mansion, Li Qiye still gently nodded: “A walk doesn’t sound bad.”</p>
 <p>The mansion occupied a wide area. Inside it had its own heavenly grotto, so it was more accurate to call it an ancestral ground than a mansion.</p>
 <p>There were temples and pavilions situated on majestic terrain everywhere. Rivers ran by with hills and other wondrous natural environments.</p>
 <p>Dongting Lake’s disciples had an eye-opening experience while following Jian Xiaotie through the mansion. They thought that it was just a series of buildings in the beginning instead of it being its own separate space. Outside of shock, they truly realized that the Jian Clan wasn’t just powerful in name.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently sighed while walking through this familiar land with an indescribable feeling.</p>
 <p>All along, the Jian Clan wanted him to come back. To a certain extent, the clan was started by him. However, after burying Jian Wenxin, he didn’t want to come back here again because the same sentence kept echoing in his head whenever he returned.</p>
 <p>“The heavens is too unreachable, there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” These were among her last words: “Your Excellency, I know your ambition is as high as the heavens and as far-reaching as the limits of the world. After I rest, I hope that you can go even further and faster. This is my end, the best I can hope for!”</p>
 <p>He gently shook his head after recalling her words. In her last moments, he didn’t blame her or Empress Hong Tian.</p>
 <p>The only pity was that Hong Tian had always been a stubborn girl. After so long, she still didn’t want to look back. However, it was precisely this unyielding stubbornness that carried her to such heights.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie, acting as a tour guide for everyone, noticed Li Qiye’s absent-mindedness and asked: “Brother Li, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s mind returned as he smiled: “Nothing, I’m just a bit tired. I will go back to rest.”</p>
 <p>“Okay then.” Jian Xiaotie replied: “I have made the arrangements for your group’s living quarters. If you are tired, we can have this tour again tomorrow. That will be when Grandfather will come out as well. I’ll take you to see him then.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only chuckled in response. Meanwhile, the disciples from the lake enviously stared at Li Qiye. The Jian Grandfather was a Celestial Godking. Not just anyone could meet a character of this level in person. It was a kind of honor.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie led the group back to the guest rooms. However, they met other people on the way.</p>
 <p>“My Queen, that’s Li Qiye.” At this time, Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion led two women here. Both of them could be considered kingdom-toppling and put girls like Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin to shame.</p>
 <p>One of them was brilliantly charming while the other noble and enchanting. Their indescribable beauty could sway the soul. This was especially true for the noble woman in her phoenix dress. She exuded the mature vibe of a woman that was too temptatious.</p>
 <p>Not only did they eclipse Hong Yujiao in beauty, their auras were powerful and imposing as well.</p>
 <p>The charming girl had divine halos emanating from her body. Belying her slender figure that gave her a fragile appearance, the halos still engulfed this world with a frightening God-Monarch presence. She was the genius of the Roaring Conch, Shangguan Feiyan!</p>
 <p>The other woman’s phoenix robe told the tale of her identity. She also had divine circles around her body with a spiritual mirror behind her head. This mirror could illuminate the entire world. It was irresistible and could steal away souls. This was the Profound God-Monarch’s favorite concubine, Gongsun Meiyu. She wasn’t a beautiful yet useless decorative vase since she was already famous as a genius before marrying the monarch in the Abyss Sea.</p>
 <p>Her talents were superb since she cultivated the unique characteristics of the charming spirit to the highest level. Her bewitching eyes showed that she had mastered her seductive techniques. Rumor has it that her divine eyes could take control of others.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu was alarmed after seeing the two women because he had heard of the feud between them and Li Qiye. He knew that Li Qiye had killed Gongsun Meiyu’s favorite maid, Gongsun Qianer.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie frowned at this development as well. He was not one who was afraid of trouble, however Shangguan Feilong and the scion were stirring the pot, and this displeased him.</p>
 <p>“You are the one who killed my maid?” Gongsun Meiyu’s eyes fell upon Li Qiye. Her phoenix eyes turned cold and stately.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was as calm as ever and only took a quick glimpse at Meiyu before replying in a flat tone: “Who?”</p>
 <p>“Gongsun Qianer!” Meiyu coldly said: “The woman you killed at the Bottomless Trench!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, yes, something like that indeed happened.” Li Qiye smiled: “Unfortunately, she shouldn’t have made a move against me. I have never shown mercy to my enemies.”</p>
 <p>“A life for a life!” Meiyu’s cold glare emitted a murderous intent: “I shall take your head and sacrifice it to her soul in the heavens.”</p>
 <p>Feilong and the scion became quite excited to see Meiyu wishing to deal with Li Qiye. The two of them felt a sense of schadenfreude while waiting for her to kill him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye revealed a wide smile and raised his brows a little while looking at her. He then glanced at Feiyan and the other two before leisurely answering: “By yourself or everyone together? I think it is better if all of you come together so that I won’t have to waste too much time cleaning you up one by one.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1254: Quarrels</b></p>
 <p>Feiyan’s expression turned sour while the others hated Li Qiye even more. Meanwhile, Jian Xiaotie smiled wryly. Provoking Meiyu alone was problematic enough, but now he had offended Feiyan as well.</p>
 <p>As for Hong Tianzhu’s group, they could only be described as speechless. Meiyu was backed by the Profound Dynasty while Feiyan came from the Roaring Conch. Both of these entities were untouchable.</p>
 <p>But now, Li Qiye was antagonizing both of them. This was simply too crazy; it was as if he didn’t care about his enemies.</p>
 <p>“Quite bold.” Feiyan’s pretty eyes turned cold. The halos around her body became even brighter as she stared at him: “I heard you are a tree controller. I want to see just how much you have learned from the Peacock Tree to allow you to act so bold and provoke me!”</p>
 <p>“Only a God-Monarch, no big deal.” Li Qiye lazily answered: “I don’t want to stain the Jian Clan with blood today. Be smart and scram or I’ll chop you to pieces!”</p>
 <p>These words were too direct and domineering. Jian Xiaotie felt his scalp tingling. This was adding oil to the fire!</p>
 <p>“How confident, let me see it then!” Before Meiyu could erupt in anger, her eyes glared at him. In an instant, a murderous energy surged forth. Her halos suppressed the entire area, leaving others breathless.</p>
 <p>“Ladies, ladies.” Jian Xiaotie quickly got between the two sides and blocked them from each other.</p>
 <p>He cupped his fists to both Li Qiye and the two girls while smiling: “Brother Li, Miss Gongsun and Miss Shangguan, how about everyone just calm down today? Take one step back and everything will be better. Today is a joyous occasion, so please, spare us some face. Just smile and drop it.”</p>
 <p>As an outsider, he didn't want to bother with their feud. However, this was before the Grandfather’s celebration and bloodshed was a very unlucky omen.</p>
 <p>“Sister Shangguan, spare his dog life for now. Let him hold onto his head for a while longer. Wait until after the birthday celebration, it won’t be too late then.” Meiyu could endure this anger despite wanting revenge for her maid.</p>
 <p>After all, fighting and killing at the birthday celebrations of the Jian Grandfather would be too disrespectful to the Jian Clan. Even though she was the monarch’s favorite, she still had a sense of propriety.</p>
 <p>“You got lucky.” In the end, Feiyan still showed some consideration towards Jian Xiaotie. She peered back at Li Qiye and said: “If it wasn’t for Young Noble Jian pleading for you, this date next year would have been your funeral.”</p>
 <p>“More like all of you are quite lucky. I do not wish to kill today, otherwise…” Li Qiye smiled gently, but his eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, this way please!” Jian Xiaotie was afraid that these three would quarrel and fight again, so he quickly led the way for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t make it difficult for Jian Xiaotie. He just came back to the Jian Clan and didn’t want to kill. Otherwise, these girls wouldn’t have the chance to act like this in front of him. His usual disposition would have made him kill anyone who revealed a murderous intent against him!</p>
 <p>The people from the lake heaved a sigh of relief. The confrontation between Li Qiye and the two women left them out of breath. A real fight would have been a very serious event.</p>
 <p>“Master Hong, I heard you have some reservations about the marriage between our clans?” As Hong Tianzhu chased after Li Qiye, Feiyan called for him with a distant tone before he could make it very far.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu didn’t want any of this, but he still had to stop and cup his fists: “Miss Shangguan, it is not that I have a negative opinion of this marriage, it is just that this pertains to the most important event in the lives of the two children. We need careful deliberation before making a choice.”</p>
 <p>“The elders from your lake have already agreed, my little brother is very happy as well, and my country is willing. Master Hong, what else is there to talk about?” Feiyan became quite imposing.</p>
 <p>With that, she stared at Hong Yujiao and stated: “Is it because your daughter is unwilling? Does she think that my Wyvern Country is not a match for your Hong Clan?!”</p>
 <p>“Well, I’m sure she doesn’t think that…” Hong Tianzhu coughed awkwardly. He didn’t want this marriage either since it was inviting wolves into their home! However, the ancestors had all agreed, so it was difficult for him to refuse.</p>
 <p>“Little Sister Hong, do you not want such a wonderful thing?” Gongsun Meiyu chimed in at this time: “Young Noble Shangguan is a dragon among men. Wyvern is also a great power in the Dragon Demon Sea, and the two of you are quite a match. Your Hong bloodline can be considered a match for him, it will pass down excellent offspring for Wyvern…”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao was already quite annoyed with Feiyan’s aggressive tone, but she became even angrier because of Gongsun Meiyu’s interjection. The woman made it sound like this marriage was her trying to climb up the social ladder…</p>
 <p>In fact, after seeing Feiyan’s presumptuous attitude, Hong Yujiao hated the idea of this marriage even more.</p>
 <p>Her temper was not that mild, so she coldly responded to Feiyan: “Miss Shangguan, I will be in charge of my marriage.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan continued to glare as she replied: “One’s marriage should be arranged by their elders. If the ancestors from the Hong Clan have decided, you just need to follow their arrangements…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye turned back and interrupted Feiyan: “If she doesn’t want this engagement, then scram already. Don’t use that shitty attitude to try and bully them! My Hong Clan is not something your Wyvern Country can reach up to!”</p>
 <p>Her previously subsided anger immediately rose again. Feilong, on the other hand, couldn’t help but step forward and shouted as well: “Li, you are not part of the Hong Clan, so this has nothing to do with you. The business of the Hong is not for you to interfere with!”</p>
 <p>Feiyan coldly glared at him and said: “Ignorant junior, I didn’t want to spill blood in this place, but you deserve a slapping with that comment.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely smiled in response: “You are right. I didn’t want to kill or spill blood here, but a slapping isn’t a bad idea!”</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, Brother Li…” Jian Xiaotie quickly stopped him and nearly grabbed him in order to stop him from rushing forward to teach Feiyan a lesson.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, please give this little brother some face? Out of consideration for me, just calm down today and don't worry about any enmity. Everyone can deal with these grudges in several days, right?”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie’s bitter expression showed that he was on the verge of begging.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at him before flatly speaking: “Tell them to stay the hell out of my sight. After today, there will be no more mercy!”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie was relieved. In fact, he didn’t know that Li Qiye was being quite considerate of him already. If it was any other time, he would have immediately began killing without a care after being provoked this much.</p>
 <p>This was his first day of returning after a very long time. He didn’t wish to spill blood in the Jian Clan right away.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu sighed as well and quickly followed Li Qiye with his disciples.</p>
 <p>“Master Hong.” Feiyan stated coldly after seeing that Tianzhu wanted to leave: “You should reconsider. Don’t let an outsider interfere with such an important matter. It won’t be good for Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>This remark was not only aggressive but also threatening. Hong Tianzhu naturally understood the implications and stiffened after hearing the words. Nevertheless, he didn’t respond and followed Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He felt very helpless in this matter. He had personally returned to the lake a couple of days ago in order to convince the ancestors, but was unsuccessful.</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t want to depend on others for this marriage, he felt an urge to trust Li Qiye this time. If no one could stop Feiyan, then this marriage would be a foregone conclusion.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao didn’t want to marry Feilong, but Tianzhu himself didn’t have the ability to change his daughter’s fate. Thus, he decided to gamble and latch onto this saving grace — Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Yujiao was quiet the entire way. She was in a daze and didn’t know what to do. She was certain that she didn’t want to marry Feilong. However, if the ancestors wouldn’t change their minds, then there was nothing else she could do.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, there’s no need to confront them so directly. Sometimes, the circuitous path is the right one.” As a human, Jian Xiaotie kindly reminded Li Qiye: “In the Dragon Demon Sea, humans are at a disadvantage. This is the world of sea demons; if you take the Roaring Conch head-on, I’m afraid you will lose sooner or later.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and answered nonchalantly: “Xiaotie, I simply didn’t want to kill today over this kind of shit, but after tomorrow, I will kill anyone who continues to be blind, even if it is inside the Jian Mansion.”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie was without words after hearing this. He warned Li Qiye with good intentions, but Li Qiye simply didn’t take it to heart.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1255: Miss Lin</b></p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie prepared the rooms for Li Qiye’s group. After taking care of everything, he finally bid goodbye.</p>
 <p>The guy was very enthusiastic and thoughtful. This was not only because of Li Qiye’s valuable gift, but also because everyone was human, so he was even more attentive towards Li Qiye’s group.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu and the other disciples rode on Li Qiye’s coattails and enjoyed this superb treatment. This was a reception that was normally meant for imperial and sea god lineages.</p>
 <p>If Hong Tianzhu’s group came alone, they wouldn’t have been subjected to this great hospitality.</p>
 <p>Among the disciples, some were happy while others worried. The majority were mostly excited by just being able to enter the Jian Mansion. It would be even better if they could meet the clan’s disciples. After all, everyone was part of the human race, so there was an easy connection there. In this regard, the current generation of Dongting Lake was still relatively unstained from ambition and the lust for power, unlike the previous.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu, Hong Yujiao, and Miss Lin all had a sleepless night. The girls were worried about their marriages. Hong Yujiao simply didn’t want to marry Feilong at all. This was doubly true for Miss Lin. She didn’t know the Bloodshark Scion at all. Moreover, his reputation was quite bad. After the marriage, she would just become an incubator, used for her holy bloodline.</p>
 <p>However, these two could only despair at their fate, unable to change it. At this time, they couldn’t help but think about Li Qiye!</p>
 <p>He was only a stranger whom they knew nothing about except that he came from Peacock Land. Nevertheless, he still gave them a favorable impression, especially when he supported them in preventing their marriages, further fueling their hope. They inadvertently prayed that this stranger could change their fate.</p>
 <p>Needless to say about Hong Tianzhu, his night was even longer. He didn’t only think about his daughter’s marriage, but also the fate of his disciples. More importantly, the future of the lake itself!</p>
 <p>Even though he was the master of the lake, his own power was limited. The ancestors from the clans did as they pleased, so he couldn't coordinate the lake as a whole. It was simply impossible to make the lake stronger under such circumstances.</p>
 <p>On top of it all, he was worried about his own future. These ancestors didn’t mind cooperating with outside races and even betrothing their most excellent bloodline to them. This was simply inviting wolves into their home!</p>
 <p>The most at peace among them must have been Zhang Baitu. He was very content at this moment and didn’t desire much more. He simply wanted to continue to persevere on the path towards the dao. Because of this, he had the best sleep out of the group.</p>
 <p>They woke up early the next day. Hong Tianzhu went to see the other guests here at the mansion and left the juniors behind.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao’s group didn’t know anyone here, so they went to find Li Qiye to see what he had in mind. However, he was nowhere to be found when they arrived at his little courtyard.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao asked: “Brother Zhang, where is Young Noble Li?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu shook his head in response: “I don’t know either. He left very early in the morning and didn’t tell me where he was off to.”</p>
 <p>The group was disappointed at his absence. The disciples looked at each other a bit before Hong Yujiao made a decision: “We’ll go out for a walk. It’ll be good to get acquainted with the Jian disciples.”</p>
 <p>The rest nodded in agreement. This was still a good opportunity for them to get closer to the Jian disciples. It was a good thing for the lake as well.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhang, come with us.” Hong Yujiao didn’t leave him out despite him not being close to the rest of the disciples.</p>
 <p>They left the small courtyard in order to take a walk around the Jian Mansion.</p>
 <p>However, they didn’t get far before meeting Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion.</p>
 <p>Feilong asked: “Little Sister, are you all going for a walk too?”</p>
 <p>The scion’s eyes lit up like a hungry wolf after seeing Miss Lin. He smiled and said: “Brother Shuangguan and I are familiar with the Jian Clan, we should go together.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao didn’t want to go together with them, but she couldn’t refuse so directly.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Jian Xiaotie came at the right time and the atmosphere settled down.</p>
 <p>“Everyone is up so early, where is Brother Li?” Jian Xiaotie wanted to bring Li Qiye’s group to more places around the Jian Clan.</p>
 <p>He had a strange affection for Li Qiye. Moreover, Li Qiye represented Peacock Land which meant that he would also stand for the human race in the future, so Jian Xiaotie was happy to befriend him.</p>
 <p>“We don’t know.” Hong Yujiao’s group shook their heads as she replied: “Young Noble Li has left much earlier. We don’t know where he went.”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie said with a little disappointment: “Oh. The venerable ancestor came out today from his cultivation, so I wanted to introduce Brother Li to him.”</p>
 <p>“My big sis and Queen Gongsun have gone to meet His Venerableness as well.” Feilong immediately added. He spoke with an elated expression. After all, few could see the Jian Grandfather, but his big sis was eligible to visit him.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie looked at Hong Yujiao’s group and suggested with a smile: “If everyone wants to take a walk, I’ll show you the way while we wait for Brother Li to come back before making other plans.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao was quite relieved to hear this. They were worried since they weren’t familiar with the mansion.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie personally led the way and acted as a good host. Feilong and the scion also shamelessly followed them with the intention of getting closer to Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t only the two girls that disliked the duo, the other disciples from the lake felt the same way. However, they weren’t the host so they couldn’t do anything but let these two follow them.</p>
 <p>Despite being the successor of the clan, Jian Xiaotie didn’t put on airs. He led the way while telling many interesting anecdotes from the clan, resulting in a lot of laughter.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Feilong and the scion used this opportunity to get closer to the two girls. However, Hong Yujiao was polite yet distant towards Feilong while Miss Lin was trying to stay as far away as possible to the scion.</p>
 <p>This annoyed the scion to no end. A sharp glint even flashed in his eyes. In his snobby mind, marrying him was Miss Lin’s blessing, but she was clearly hiding from him. He intended to teach her a lesson later on so that she would come to learn her own status!</p>
 <p>Outside of certain forbidden locations, Xiaotie took the group to many different places. He was especially attentive towards the disciples from the lake.</p>
 <p>They eventually passed by an ancient-styled courtyard. It had high walls so no one could see what was inside.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Jian, what is this place?” Zhang Baitu became curious at this fortress-like courtyard with its high walls.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie stopped and explained: “This is an old building in our clan that is normally closed and locked. I can’t enter either.”</p>
 <p>He knew very little about this old courtyard, only that it dated back to the era of their progenitor. As for its purpose, he and the other disciples simply did not know.</p>
 <p>Normally, this courtyard wouldn’t be open to outsiders. He, as the successor, had only entered a few times. Alas, he failed to see through the mysteries inside and assumed that it was only a regular building.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Jian, the door is open.” A lake disciple walking ahead cried out and curiously looked inside.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie was surprised to hear this and quickened his pace. Sure enough, the normally shut wooden door was actually open.</p>
 <p>“Who opened it?” Jian Xiaotie was caught off guard and immediately went inside.</p>
 <p>The disciples from the lake were curious and followed him.</p>
 <p>This courtyard was not large. There was a lot of green bamboo here with their shadows swaying around. When the wind blew by, the leaves would flutter. This was a very elegant place, great for contemplation.</p>
 <p>In the center of the courtyard was a stone table with chairs surrounding it, and on the table was a chess board. A statue was situated on one side while a person sat opposite to it. [1. It is Chinese chess, xiangqi.]</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, why are you here?” Jian Xiaotie was surprised to see the person seated in the chair.</p>
 <p>It was Li Qiye; he sat there quietly as if he didn’t hear the question. The rest of the group saw him and didn’t think that he would be here after leaving so early in the morning.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1256: Torn Body And Crushed Bones</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye seemed to be in a trance as he didn’t answer anyone.</p>
 <p>This chess match was very messy. No one could see what kind of chess game this was because the pieces were placed outrageously, as if a little child had randomly put them there.</p>
 <p>The statue sitting on the other side seemed to be a woman, judging by its appearance. However, the style in which it was carved was very vague, so people couldn’t discern her features.</p>
 <p>However, upon a closer inspection of its contours, it was clear that it wasn’t the creator who chose to sculpt in this vague manner, it was because the woman didn’t want the world to see her true appearance. It was hidden like Mount Lushan amidst the clouds.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye remained there motionlessly, as if he had turned into stone as well.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li, how did you get in?” Jian Xiaotie took a look around and found that no one else was here. He became quite puzzled because if the people in the clan didn’t open it, outsiders shouldn’t have been able to enter.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Li Qiye continued to sit there, frozen. Who knows if he was enchanted by the chess match or something else. All in all, he seemed to be shut off from the rest of the world.</p>
 <p>No one expected Li Qiye to be playing chess against a statue after leaving so early in the morning. They took a look at the messy board and didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
 <p>Miss Lin, who had a very favorable impression of him, bent down and whispered with a gentle demeanor: “Young Noble, are you okay?”</p>
 <p>There was still no reply from the seemingly petrified Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The scion became jealous after seeing her gentle demeanor towards Li Qiye. His eyes turned cold as he sneered: “Hmph, it’s only a statue and a dumb game, what’s the point of acting all mysterious? Does he really think he’s all that, using this board to comprehend the grand dao of the nine heavens? Hmph, he’s just dressing up as god and playing the devil to act cool.”</p>
 <p>Miss Lin, who already hated him, became even more unhappy. She frowned in response: “Young Noble Li is deep in focus right now, who says he is pretending?”</p>
 <p>“Hah, deep in focus?” The scion became even more jealous after hearing Miss Lin speak out for Li Qiye. He smirked and said with disdain: “That’s only a broken statue. Does he need to contemplate so hard against a statue? Only a fool would need to do so. Perhaps this statue was picked up from a rubbish heap, heh, a work without any craftsmanship or art, a piece of garbage that only a fool would take seriously.”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie’s expression soured after hearing this, but he was a cultured person and didn’t show his hostility in public.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the scion was blinded by his own jealousy and didn’t think too much or notice the look on Jian Xiaotie’s face.</p>
 <p>Feilong also shook his head and laughed: “Scion, you shouldn’t laugh at the guy. People can be a little bit eccentric. Staring at a statue in a daze, this is nothing, only a type of mental disorder. I heard some miracle doctors can cure this illness in the Dragon Demon Sea.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ruined his business with Hong Yujiao time and time again, so Feilong wanted to kill him. Because of this, he naturally seized this opportunity to ridicule him.</p>
 <p>“Mental disorder?” The scion sneered: “This is far worse than a mental disorder. It is an abnormal and perverted taste. Only an extremely wretched scoundrel would have fantasies towards such an ugly statue, only a monster would be interested in this stone abomination!”</p>
 <p>The scion had lost his rational restraints and didn’t realize that his words were offending other people. Jian Xiaotie’s expression was becoming worse and worse. Prior to this, he was indifferent towards Feilong’s taunting of Li Qiye. After all, that was their personal feud.</p>
 <p>But now, the scion not only insulted Li Qiye, but also the statue. This was a great symbol in their clan, so how could Jian Xiaotie not become mad?</p>
 <p>At this time, Li Qiye suddenly stood up and went outside.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Did I touch a nerve? Are you too ashamed now and want to run away?” The scion guffawed and felt the joy of victory after seeing Li Qiye leaving without a word.</p>
 <p>Feilong echoed cheerfully as well: “Looks like he is at least aware of his lowliness. Scion, you exposing his fetish left him no face to stay here any longer.”</p>
 <p>“Roll out here and accept your death lest your lowly blood stain the serenity of this place.” Li Qiye coldly uttered from outside of the ancient courtyard.</p>
 <p>The initially angry scion became even more furious. He snorted in response: “Li, you think I’m afraid of you? The person who is about to die has yet to be determined!” With that, he rushed outside as well.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, don’t think you can run rampant just because you are a treefather’s disciple.” Feilong snorted and darted outside.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was emotionless. This time around, the host, Jian Xiaotie, didn’t bother interfering. He stood there with both arms crossed in front of his chest and indifferently watched events unfold.</p>
 <p>He was angry this time. It was already quite polite of him to not attack the scion for insulting his ancestor, let alone stopping the fight.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave him a chilling glare before leisurely asking: “How do the two of you want to die?”</p>
 <p>“So confident!” Feilong sneered and coldly responded: “Li Qiye, do you really think we are fish on the chopping block? The only reason I have yet to kill you is because Queen Gongsun has already claimed your dog life. But if you provoke me, I’ll still kill you all the same!”</p>
 <p>“Less blabbering, come together, I will give you two the first strike.” Li Qiye was unusually cold. Those who knew him would find this whole scene very surprising and become frightened.</p>
 <p>They knew that when he had such a cold appearance, his bloodthirst would be roused. At such a juncture, he would start killing without mercy no matter who the opponent might be.</p>
 <p>In fact, Li Qiye viewed these two as ants, so he could turn a deaf ear to their jeering. Unfortunately, they were fatally naive and insulted the statue. After uttering those words, their fates were sealed. No one would be able to save them from certain demise.</p>
 <p>“How arrogant!” The scion crazily laughed before stating: “Li, who the hell do you think you are? Do you really think that having a treefather for a master is that great? My ancestor was an invincible sea god! Your background is nothing in comparison!”</p>
 <p>The Bloodshark Sovereign from their village had been recognized by the Trident, but it eventually abandoned him so he failed to become a full-fledged sea god.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the village still took pride in him being accepted by the Trident and claimed that their ancestor was a sea god!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly declared without batting an eye: “Go, I shall kill the both of you with one move.”</p>
 <p>Feilong angrily replied: “Very well, Li Qiye. The scion and I will test your skill.”</p>
 <p>The scion took out a crimson blade with a bloody mist billowing around it. He licked his lips while his eyes revealed a bloodthirsty glint before speaking: “Little animal, my blade has not tasted blood in a long time, I’ll let it have its fill today.”</p>
 <p>Miss Lin turned pale from shock and kindly reminded Li Qiye: “Young Noble, be careful of his blade.”</p>
 <p>Her demeanor only further ignited the scion’s fury. He furiously screamed: “Little animal, die!”</p>
 <p>With that, his body turned into a bloody ray as he came slashing towards Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>A bang was followed by a snap, and then the harsh sound of bones cracking.</p>
 <p>Everyone saw Li Qiye fling the scion straight to the ground with one hand. The ground cracked along with the scion’s flesh. Li Qiye then grabbed him by the leg and continued to smash him mercilessly, causing his blood to splash everywhere.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was too fast and no one could even see how the scion fell into his hands. They only saw the smashing; fleshy bits began to fly alongside the blood.</p>
 <p>At this time, these broken bits of meat were still bouncing on the ground, drenched in warm blood.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1257: Cemetery</b></p>
 <p>This scene of carnage was simply too shocking. Hong Yujiao and the disciples from the lake all felt the urge to puke.</p>
 <p>They had heard of the phrase “torn body and crushed bones.” However, they had never actually witnessed bones breaking into powder until today. This was truly the embodiment of “torn body and crushed bones.”</p>
 <p>They quivered after seeing this bloody display, only Jian Xiaotie stood there coolly. This was within his expectations.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lifted his head and coldly stared at Shangguan Feilong without taking action just yet.</p>
 <p>Feilong’s legs were trembling. He wasn’t that much stronger than the scion. No, the scion was actually stronger than him, and yet he was annihilated in just one move. This result left him pissing his pants in horror.</p>
 <p>“You… you... don’t come over here! Don’t come over here!” After seeing Li Qiye inching closer, he stumbled several steps back with a pale countenance. He was truly scared out of his mind this time.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye continued to take one step after another while glaring at him.</p>
 <p>“You… don’t do anything foolish!” Feilong kept on stumbling backward while shouting: “I, I am the crown prince of Wyvern, my sister is the mistress of the Roaring Conch while my brother-in-law is the Seashield Prince. If, if you dare to touch a hair of mine, my, my sister will not spare you! My Wyvern will root out your nine clans!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued his stride without replying.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Jian, hurry and save me!” After noticing that Li Qiye had no intention of stopping, Feilong had to shout at Jian Xiaotie to try to grab onto him as a life-saving straw.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie wanted to say something, but after seeing Li Qiye’s cold expression and determined steps, he knew that it would be a futile endeavor.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shangguan, this is your personal feud, I’m afraid it is not my place to intervene.” Jian Xiaotie realized that those who try to stop Li Qiye would only be seeking their own destruction. He didn’t want to be someone else’s cannon fodder.</p>
 <p>“Stop, stop!” Feilong screamed louder as Li Qiye approached: “I, I won’t marry Hong Yujiao then! You can have her, okay?!”</p>
 <p>In the face of death, Feilong desperately said everything he could; he would do anything just to survive.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao immediately looked at him with disdain after hearing this. The disciples of the lake gave him the same glance.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped and coldly told Feilong: “I will give you a chance to attack.”</p>
 <p>Feilong swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said: “If, if you stand still, I’ll do it.”</p>
 <p>“Very well, I will give you a chance and stand still.” Li Qiye flatly replied while looking at the weak-legged Feilong.</p>
 <p>Feilong went on: “You, you must keep your word and not move at all or, or else I’ll be the winner.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye indifferently said: “Quickly, I won’t move…”</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye couldn’t even finish his sentence before Feilong began to desperately run away with all of his strength. At this moment, he wished his mother had given him two more legs to allow him to flee even faster.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but shake his head disapprovingly after seeing the frantic escape. His eyes turned cold with a flash that shot out as fast as a divine arrow.</p>
 <p>“No…” Right when the next enclosure was within his sight, Feilong suddenly felt a jolt of pain and had to scream. Next, his corpse fell to the ground with a loud thump.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly murmured after killing Feilong with his glare: “Daring to cultivate with such a dao heart.”</p>
 <p>Even the lake’s disciples looked down on him at this moment. Even though the Bloodshark Scion was loathful, at least he was still a fierce character. Feilong gave up his own marriage and showed that he would hand over his fiancee to someone else just to survive.</p>
 <p>After disposing of the two, Li Qiye acted as if nothing had happened. He ordered Xiaotie before entering the old courtyard again: “Xiaotie, I’ll leave them to you.”</p>
 <p>“Squeak.” After his entry, the wooden doors to the courtyard suddenly shut tight.</p>
 <p>Xiaotie wanted to speak, but Li Qiye had already locked himself inside. In the end, he could only sigh.</p>
 <p>A disciple from the lake said with admiration: “Young Noble Li is so powerful.”</p>
 <p>Another one added: “He is the disciple of an ancestral tree, how could he not be powerful?”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao watched as his shadow disappeared into the courtyard and lamented with a sigh as well. This person was a dragon shrouded in clouds and mists; no one could truly see through him.</p>
 <p>Miss Lin was temporarily frozen while recalling Li Qiye’s invincible demeanor and style when he stood up for her. A long time passed before she calmed down as her face inadvertently blushed.</p>
 <p>After going inside, Li Qiye sat down before the chess board again to look at the statue in a daze. After a while, he lamented: “The burden I feel whenever I come here has kept me from coming back for all this time, but I have to leave in this generation so let me see you one more time.”</p>
 <p>With that, he raised a chess piece and placed it down on the board again. The whole scheme of the board suddenly changed; the movement of one piece could stabilize the universe.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The atmosphere of the board resembled an ocean of stars. It was vast and endless as it slowly swirled like a vortex.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stepped inside this starry vortex and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>When he regained his sight, he found himself in a place with beautiful mountains and rivers. In this place was the warm sunlight accompanied by a pleasant spring breeze. The sunlight was very gentle like the sweet embrace of a woman.</p>
 <p>There was a small hillside. The entire hill was spread like a palm to hug someone. It was covered with grassy plains, and one would smell a comfortable fragrance if they were to rest here.</p>
 <p>Two rows of treasure bamboos were planted to the left and right sides of this hill. These extremely precious trees exuded purple glows; each one was priceless.</p>
 <p>At the same time, there was an old well on one side that emitted an ethereal mist. A purple hue could be found within, and the plumes of this mist continued to emanate throughout the entire hill. This well that was engulfed in a purple mist resembled an immortal land while its wondrous brilliance made it seem as if there was an incredible item buried at the bottom.</p>
 <p>Upon a careful inspection, one would find a tablet within the mist-filled land. It had the appearance of an antique, indicating that it was made from the legendary Celestial Violet Stone.</p>
 <p>It was truly extravagant to carve a tombstone out of this celestial stone. Fewer than few people in this world were able to enjoy such treatment. Not even a Godking was eligible for this grand gesture.</p>
 <p>In Memory of Jian Wenxin — this was written on the tablet. Just these five words alone could last for an eternity. The withering of time failed to erode it.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was petrified while standing before the tablet. He eventually lied down on the grass in front of it.</p>
 <p>He slowly closed his eyes as if he wanted to sleep here. Everything became incredibly quiet and peaceful — a state of gentle repose.</p>
 <p>After a long time, he opened his eyes to look at the well as he spoke with a faint smile: “You know, when I took the dragonwell in order to bring a spirit vein to this place, the geezer from the Giant Dragon Mountain was very unhappy. After so many years, that old man is still so stingy. His greedy nature probably won’t ever change.”</p>
 <p>The world remained silent. No one could talk or respond in this serenity.</p>
 <p>“So much time has passed that I have let go of what should be let go of. I have made peace with the past.” Li Qiye looked at the blue sky and chuckled: “But that girl, Hong Tian, will not let it go. She won’t admit her mistake back then and refuses to stand down. Alas, being right or wrong doesn’t matter to me since I have lived for so long. Both of you did what you did for my sake.”</p>
 <p>The world remained still; no response could be found.</p>
 <p>“Among the winding distant years, not too many people have understood me and know of my desire.” Li Qiye heaved a sentimental sigh and continued: “It is a pity that you wanted an ordinary life.”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps your endless wisdom allowed you to see through the prosperity of this world. In your eyes, a mundane life was the most precious thing. After experiencing the pains in life, you wanted to pursue an ordinary happiness and hoped to have a warm home.”</p>
 <p>“Alas, I am destined to go on a long journey and you couldn’t hold me back. Of course, I didn’t force you to follow me into endless wars, an endless cycle of murder!” Li Qiye sighed softly.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1258: Past Feelings</b></p>
 <p>One grave and one person in a hushed world. The wind was gently blowing like a gentle hand caressing every inch of the flesh. A warm sensation accompanied its coolness, inducing a drowsy desire.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lied there and whispered intimately. No one knows if he was simply expressing himself or letting go of all burdens.</p>
 <p>“The reason I didn’t want to go back was not because I couldn’t forget the past. That’s all it is, the past.” Li Qiye said with a trace of helplessness: “Whenever I come to Rainbow City, I can’t help but recall your unforgettable words.”</p>
 <p>A prolonged silence ensued as Li Qiye became quite sentimental. He eventually lifted his head to look at the tombstone: “I came back in order to say goodbye. My journey this time will be full of the unknown.”</p>
 <p>“In the nine heavens and ten earths, I’m not afraid of the godfiends, emperors, or deities, not even the geezers from the Qian Clan. Sooner or later, I will trample on them all. I will massacre all those who try to stop me and even annihilate their clans completely!” Li Qiye claimed while looking at the horizon.</p>
 <p>However, his mood soured once more: “The only uncertainty is the great war at the end of the world. No one knows what will come of this world. Perhaps my era will be everlasting… or it will be utterly destroyed. But someone needs to take this final step. I won’t stop no matter what the final outcome might be. No, I can’t be stopped and I won’t make compromises either!”</p>
 <p>“You told me that the heavens is too unreachable and that there is nothing bad about being a trapped ant in this world.” He mournfully said: “But I will not be an ant! I can’t handle being an ant! Whether it be the Immortal Demon Grotto or the end of the world, I will continue even if the path is endless!</p>
 <p>“Just like back then when you asked me if I wanted to stay. My answer will always be ‘never’!” His eyes became determined: “In years past, some have broken my bones, some have exposed me to all kinds of suffering, some completely sealed my world and some mocked and reviled me…</p>
 <p>"Then there were the many who loved me, whom I loved, and those who were loyal to me… They slowly disappeared in the river of time… But whether it’s my enemies, friends, or even lovers, none of them can stop me from reaching the end! I will either become eternal or mere ashes! These are the only two possible outcomes for me.</p>
 <p>“When you asked why I didn’t indulge myself and became a happy and satisfied mortal, this is my answer. I refuse to compromise with anyone!” He became silent after stating this.</p>
 <p>“This might be our final farewell. As for Hong Tian, it will be up to her. I don’t blame her, but if she blames me, I can’t do anything about it. Farewell, Wenxin, the one who understood me and my ambition the most.” Eventually, he gave the tombstone a deep look before leaving without turning back.</p>
 <p>Jian Wenxin was an indelible name that would forever stay in his heart.</p>
 <p>In that distant yet brilliant era, Empress Hong Tian had yet to ascend to her throne. There existed many apex geniuses and incredible characters. Three particular girls reigned supreme for the whole of this era; many men were completely overshadowed by them.</p>
 <p>There was a widespread phrase during that period to describe the three ladies: Hong Tian — the Ill-starred Conqueror, Jian Wenxin — the Ocean’s Wisdom, Mu Yueli — the Immortal’s Legacy. [1. These are four-word phrases being used as adjectives, essentially secondary titles for the three. Hong Tian is considered to be unlucky or ill-fated with a bad constitution, so that’s her name. Ocean’s Wisdom used to be “as wise as the ocean”, but I like Ocean’s Wisdom more. Immortal’s Legacy used to be “as great as an immortal”, but it is what it is for the same reason above. The real meanings behind “legacy” are: 1/ physical beauty 2/ natural temperament/style/aura 3/ natural talents/constitution 4/ natural characters/morals. It’s hard to find a descriptor here that fits all of that, so legacy it is.]</p>
 <p>Empress Hong Tian was not particularly excellent in terms of innate talents, but her ambition had no bounds. Because of this, many people mocked her for having “a will higher than the heavens and a fate thinner than paper” when she made her dao debut.</p>
 <p>As the Dark Crow, on the day when he met this girl with that determined look in her eyes, the first thing he taught her was not a profound merit law but one sentence that would forever stay with her — can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan?!</p>
 <p>This phrase stuck with the little miss for her whole life. From then on, her name changed to Hong Tian, a name that would illuminate the eons and deter both gods and devils!</p>
 <p>Her will was higher than the heavens, but her fate was thinner than paper. It was definitely not easy for her during that brilliant era since her ordinary talents couldn’t reach the apex compared to the other geniuses.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, even before such foes, she was determined to reign above the nine heavens! Such an unrealistic dream caused her to be ridiculed by countless people and made her suffer many painful hardships.</p>
 <p>During those long years, she failed and cried. Tears and blood were spilled, but she persevered onward and made it very far with a crow as her companion.</p>
 <p>Her life had no lack of failures. She had lost more than just once to the hands of Jian Wenxin.</p>
 <p>This was a woman full of wisdom who had deep ties with the Dark Crow since youth. After her debut, she aimed for the Heaven’s Will and became one of the strongest rivals of Immortal Emperor Hong Tian.</p>
 <p>With her great wisdom, she was able to scheme and strategize, much to the chagrin of the empress.</p>
 <p>However, despite being so gifted at birth, she chose mundanity at the end of her path. Her experiences made her give up on the Heaven’s Will as she chose to stay with the Dark Crow and plot for him from behind the curtains.</p>
 <p>It could be said that the empress’ unstoppable conquest, to a large extent, was to Jian Winxen’s credit from behind the scenes.</p>
 <p>Born to be extraordinary yet choosing to be ordinary. She wanted to stay in this world and live the rest of her life as a mortal. Alas, she was still exceptional due to her boundless wisdom. After becoming an empress, Hong Tian consulted Jian Wenxin about a certain matter.</p>
 <p>At that time, they shared the same belief. Jian Wenxin came up with a perfect plan while the empress carried it out. Because of this, the Dark Crow and the empress had a falling out.</p>
 <p>For the empress, there was nothing more important than the Dark Crow. In this world, he was the only one who was there for her when she smiled and cried. No matter how difficult it was, his shadow would always be beside her!</p>
 <p>The always-stubborn empress was never obstinate before him, but not this time. The two had a great quarrel and from then on they parted ways and continued on their individual paths.</p>
 <p>Jian Wenxin had augured the mysteries of the heaven and earth and spied into its secrets in order to concoct the plan. Because of this, she wasted too much energy and arrived at her deathbed. Even with this turn of events, she wanted to have a peaceful end with the Dark Crow next to her.</p>
 <p>After her departure from this world, Li Qiye buried her in this incredibly beautiful place. He then left to a faraway place and began his slumber.</p>
 <p>From then on, he never stepped foot into the Jian Clan again. It was not because he blamed her for that particular event, but because he always remembered that one phrase from her.</p>
 <p>It was because she knew him and his thoughts the best that it was difficult for him to forget those words. He finally returned in this generation and visited her grave because it might be their final farewell.</p>
 <p>He sighed after leaving the cemetery. However, he also felt relieved for finally returning after so long. At last, he was able to say goodbye one last time.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie, who was standing guard outside of the old courtyard, immediately stood up after seeing Li Qiye coming out. He didn’t dare to believe his eyes and had no words to describe his feelings.</p>
 <p>This was because he had heard of a legend in their clan. He didn’t know whether it was real or not, but he felt that he was seeing a ghost instead of Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and asked: “Is something wrong?”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie was startled and quickly regained his mind to say: “Brother Li, there is a problem. Miss Hong and Daoist Zhang have been captured by Shangguan Feiyan.”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you to take good care of them?” Li Qiye frowned in response.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie wryly smiled and explained: “Brother Li, Feiyan was crazy as she searched for you. Since she couldn’t find you, she captured Miss Hong and Daoist Zhang instead. I could only do my best and stopped her from hurting them in the slightest.”</p>
 <p>“She said that as long as you go meet her, she will let them go.” Jian Xiaotie was a bit ashamed as he continued on: “I have consulted the ancestors about this. If Feiyan doesn’t release them, they will force her to do so.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1259: Gathering Of Heroes</b></p>
 <p>So it turned out that after Li Qiye killed Shangguan Feilong, his sister became furious and wanted to kill Li Qiye as an offering for her brother.</p>
 <p>After she came running, Li Qiye could no longer be found, so she directed her anger towards the disciples from the lake instead. Luckily, Jian Xiaotie was there to stop her.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, she didn’t concede and took away Baitu and Yujiao while declaring that Li Qiye had to come and accept his death. Otherwise, she would kill these two instead.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold as he flatly said: “When it is time for blood to flow, there is no stopping it. If those girls wish to die, I’ll gladly help them.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned and left.</p>
 <p>Though those words were casually spoken, the cold flash in his eyes left Jian Xiaotie quivering. He felt that he was looking at a death god that was about to kill.</p>
 <p>A garden in the Jian Clan was being used to entertain the respected guests. At this time, there were many people here, including some of the most exceptional talents of the younger generation. There were a few experts from the previous generations as well. Some of them were even Virtuous Paragons.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feiyan and Gongsun Meiyu definitely stood out in this place; they were moons surrounded by stars.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feiyan was only second to the Seashield Prince among the geniuses at the Roaring Conch. Gongsun Meiyu was extremely famous as well, and her fame only rose after marrying the Profound Monarch.</p>
 <p>At this feast, the elegant and enchanting Meiyu had an irresistible style. Each of her smiles and grimaces was able to sway souls. Nevertheless, no one dared to have any devious thoughts. It was suicidal to compete for the Profound Monarch's woman.</p>
 <p>As for Feiyan, she stood here in an arrogant and chilling manner. Naturally, her mood was quite foul after her brother was killed.</p>
 <p>This was an occasion meant for the youths. They happily came together to talk about all kinds of events in the world.</p>
 <p>“My Queen, I heard the monarch has come out of his isolated cultivation. When will we be graced with his presence?” Someone couldn’t help but bring up the monarch.</p>
 <p>Many youths and even characters from the previous generation became excited after hearing this name. They all directed their attention towards Meiyu.</p>
 <p>The Profound Monarch's fame was not empty. His title was slightly approved of by the older God-Monarchs as well.</p>
 <p>It would be a mistake if someone were to think that he was old. In fact, he was not that much older than Gongsun Meiyu. His talents and constitution could easily be imagined due to his early accomplishments.</p>
 <p>He came from the Profound Sea Dynasty, one of the four branches of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.</p>
 <p>This was the first emperor in this world, and his four branches were formed during the Desolate Era. From this, one could see how old and strong these branches were among the charming spirits.</p>
 <p>They had produced three Immortal Emperors and one grand completion Immortal Physique. This allowed them to have an unshakable status in Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>The monarch had been extremely gifted since his youth. After becoming a monarch, he came into control of the Profound Dynasty.</p>
 <p>After hearing the question, the charming-to-the-bones Meiyu chuckled. This slight smile made others tremble uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>She answered: “The monarch has returned to the origin. He is opening up his territory to create a kingdom in order to receive the tributes of his people.”</p>
 <p>Everyone here quivered after hearing this. The youths were full of envy and admiration. To become a True Monarch at such a young age was incredibly awe-inspiring.</p>
 <p>There were five levels to God-Monarchs. In the mind of the older generation, only those at the True Monarch level and above were considered God-Monarchs.</p>
 <p>For example, Feiyan was an Intermediate Monarch. However, in the eyes of the strong, she was not much at all; she was still a bit lacking before she deserved the title of God-Monarch.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, there was a great gap between an Intermediate Monarch and a True Monarch. After reaching the true level, this monarch would have their own citizens and be able to receive tributes from them that would strengthen their blood energy.</p>
 <p>Thus, these monarchs had an innate advantage that Intermediate Monarchs couldn’t make up for. Right now, the Profound Monarch had opened up his kingdom to receive power from this new source.</p>
 <p>“What a pity.” An older paragon gently sighed: “If the monarch chose the path of the heavens, he could probably have become an Immortal Emperor to become a ruler alongside the Seashield Prince.”</p>
 <p>Many people gently nodded in agreement. Only Meiyu smiled and proudly declared: “Even if the monarch can't become an Immortal Emperor, he will definitely become something quite close to one.”</p>
 <p>No one would refute this claim because they believed the Profound Monarch was worthy of this high evaluation.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, the charming spirits have the Profound Monarch and the sea demons have the Seashield Prince. Who else can compare to them in the contemporary?” A cultivator wanted to please Meiyu with flattery.</p>
 <p>An old paragon nodded and praised: “Yes. The Seashield Prince has pretty much received the recognition of the Trident. After doing so, he will be able to reach the peak and become a sea god. From then on, he won't need to fear even an Immortal Emperor any longer.”</p>
 <p>Many people grew excited when they heard this, especially the sea demons. Their blood began to surge after the Trident was brought up. This was an inevitable reaction for those of their race.</p>
 <p>It was the ultimate artifact of their race and completely invincible in this world. It was even better than an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, so it became the sea demons’ pride. In their eyes, even if they couldn’t shoulder the Heaven’s Will, they could still fight an Immortal Emperor as long as the wielder could handle the Trident.</p>
 <p>A demon sect master commented emotionally: “Ever since the Lithodidae Sea God, the Trident has not appeared. Its appearance this time will herald a new supreme.” [1. Okay, Lithodidae is just King Crab. I mused through it and looked for another name, but Lithodidae seems close enough. King Crab Sea God is just too strange even though I usually refrain from using modern taxonomy for names.]</p>
 <p>The Lithodidae Sea God was the previous sea god of their race. In the past, the trident had actually recognized the Bloodshark Sovereign. However, for some unknown reason, it abandoned him and chose the Lithodidae Sea God instead.</p>
 <p>“In this era, we have two candidates who qualify — the Seven Seas Martial Goddess and the Seashield Prince.” A sea demon here immediately commented without thinking.</p>
 <p>His friend immediately elbowed him and told him to be more careful with his words. This sea demon finally noticed that Feiyan was here and smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>The Roaring Conch was one of the strongest sea demon lineages in this region. They had produced two sea gods in the past. However, there was another behemoth around — the Seven Martial Pavilion. It was even stronger since it had given rise to three sea gods before!</p>
 <p>The Seashield Prince was considered the strongest prodigy among the sea demons, but the Seven Seas Goddess was just as excellent. There was even a rumor stating that she had learned all seven grand styles from the pavilion!</p>
 <p>Meiyu only smiled after hearing this: “The prince is a supreme genius, I’m sure he will become the next sea god.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan also coldly responded: “My senior brother can compete with any other genius in this generation. The trident shall be his alone no matter who the other competitors might be.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s cold expression slightly melted after talking about her brother.</p>
 <p>People were taken aback after hearing her evaluation. After all, she was still a monarch, yet she held him in such high regard. This was indicative of his strength.</p>
 <p>In fact, some had heard that Feiyan gave up on the path of the heavens because she knew she was not as strong as her brother. Because of this, she trod the path of the grand era instead.</p>
 <p>The normally aloof girl couldn’t help but comment more on her senior brother: “He will not only become a sea god but also a user of a grand completion Immortal Physique. Others will only be wasting time trying to compete against him for the Trident.”</p>
 <p>Her demeanor unavoidably became one of yearning and adoration.</p>
 <p>Another sea demon flattered: “The prince’s Void Physique has been famous for a long time now. Even if the Seven Seas Goddess knows all seven styles of the pavilion, she still might not be able to contend against him.”</p>
 <p>Despite the glorified praise, many people exchanged glances filled with respect. This was because the Seashield Prince was rumored to have a half-completion Immortal Physique. Feiyan’s statement today only made these rumors even more credible.</p>
 <p>“We have many talents in the Heaven Spirit World right now. Even though no one has come out among the treants, just our Profound Monarch and Seashield Prince are enough to not be afraid of any other genius in the nine worlds when they become connected again.” A young cultivator laughed after stating this.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. This will be the era of our charming spirits and sea demons. As for the human race… they aren’t worth mentioning.” Another echoed the sentiment.</p>
 <p>“I heard that a human named Li Qiye has come out recently. He is quite strong as well.” A reckless boy couldn’t help but comment.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1260: Divine Reflection Seductive Gaze</b></p>
 <p>Many people were astounded after hearing this reckless kid. Everyone knew about the enmity between Li Qiye and Gongsun Meiyu since he killed her maid. And recently, he killed Feiyan’s little brother as well.</p>
 <p>Someone next to him gently gave him a nudge. However, this kid was too honest and continued on without realizing the situation: “Why are you pushing me? I’m just telling the truth. Rumor has it that back at the Jade Sea, Li Qiye refined billions of Teeming Fish, something that no one in history has ever dared to do before. The treants in that region are saying that he is as ferocious as a butcher. Everyone is afraid of him there.”</p>
 <p>The people standing next to him felt helpless and wanted to make some distance between him and them. They looked away as if to say that they didn’t know this crazy fella.</p>
 <p>Feiyan, who was sitting there coldly, scowled after hearing this, but she didn’t act up.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, many still noticed her displeasure and immediately spoke: “I have heard about the blood sacrifice as well, but that’s only a rumor. The real mastermind was the Peacock Tree, Li Qiye was only an errand boy carrying out instructions.”</p>
 <p>“But it was still refining an entire army of Teeming Fish.” The young boy was unrelenting: “He still dared to stand before so many of them, this speaks volume of his great courage. If it was me, I would have pissed my pants already.”</p>
 <p>“Courage at times is only blind ignorance and arrogance.” Feiyan coldly stated: “Cultivators rely on power, ignorance will only lead to death.”</p>
 <p>“Shut up, no more from you.” The senior of the reckless boy noticed Feiyan becoming angry and quickly slapped him.</p>
 <p>The youth felt wronged after being scolded by his senior, but he couldn’t do anything besides silently smolder with indignation.</p>
 <p>“Haha, he’s only a human, nothing much. The Heaven Spirit World belongs to us sea demons and charming spirits. A human alone can’t create any winds or waves.” This senior laughed in order to smooth things out.</p>
 <p>Gongsun Meiyu snickered and said: “He’s just a junior, that’s all. There is nothing to talk about. He has been presumptuous for too long and has now provoked me, so it is time for him to die!”</p>
 <p>“Of course, of course.” Someone immediately echoed the sentiment: “A human is nothing in our Heaven Spirit World! So what if he is a tree controller? He can’t amount to much. If these humans dare to oppose us sea demons, we’ll just wipe them out completely. A bunch of ants daring to be so impudent before us dragons—”</p>
 <p>“Bam!” A slap came before this sea demon could finish speaking. It sent him flying and made him vomit blood alongside some of his teeth.</p>
 <p>“I want to see who would dare to destroy my human race.” A leisured voice came about. At this time, Li Qiye stepped into the garden and swept through the crowd with his belittling gaze.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” Many charming spirits and sea demons immediately stood up to look at him.</p>
 <p>After seeing him, Feiyan’s eyes emitted a terrifying murderous intent. Meiyu turned cold as well as she stared intensely at him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave them dismissive glances and nonchalantly said: “Hand over Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s God-Monarch halos began to pulsate. She no longer hid her power as her aura ran rampant like a soaring dragon. These halos seemed to have the trajectory of stars as they shut out this area completely. The whole world turned cold before her bloodthirst.</p>
 <p>At this time, she was showing off her strongest state, so those with shallow cultivations felt their legs trembling and had to stumble several steps back.</p>
 <p>Even though they all knew she was a God-Monarch, it was still frightening when she emitted her God-Monarch’s might!</p>
 <p>The sea demon that was slapped by Li Qiye immediately shouted after seeing Feiyan channeling her energy: “Goddess Shangguan, kill him. Crush this human ant into meat paste, show him no mercy for opposing our race.”</p>
 <p>His expression became twisted after being slapped flying by Li Qiye in front of everyone, causing him to lose all face.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Li Qiye kicked him down again, creating a deep pit with blood dyeing the paved slate.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye demanded: “Let them go, this is your last chance.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s bloodthirst surged even more, causing everyone to shiver. Her murderous intent came sweeping by, seemingly flaying the flesh off of everyone standing nearby.</p>
 <p>Feiyan mercilessly exclaimed: “I can let them go if you kneel and kowtow to profess your crime, then commit suicide. I will use your skull as an offering to my brother in heaven and let those two go. Otherwise, not only will you suffer a fate worse than death, those around you will suffer the same way!”</p>
 <p>“It seems that you still don’t know life from death.” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Come and accept your death!” The entire world was flipped upside down when Feiyan stepped forward. Her aura suppressed the entire garden so others couldn’t even move half a step. Some even felt the impulse to kneel.</p>
 <p>Her aura rendered people out of breath before she even attacked. This made people exchange glances while feeling chills. Her fame as a God-Monarch was not baseless at all.</p>
 <p>“When a God-Monarch is around, Virtuous Paragons are nothing.” Even an ordinary paragon from the previous generation had to murmur after feeling the pressure.</p>
 <p>“Sister Shangguan, there’s no need to kill him so fast. Torture him first, let him taste the agony of betrayal and watch his friends die.” Gongsun Meiyu suddenly interjected right as Feiyan was about to attack.</p>
 <p>With a buzz, a bright mirror emerged behind her head. Profound runes appeared right on the mirror; everything became as bright as scintillating snow, nothing could hide before its light.</p>
 <p>“Celestial reflection…” A few people who knew about her looked at each other then quietly retreated to make some distance.</p>
 <p>Celestial reflection was something that only charming spirits could do. People also called it divine reflection. It was extremely heaven-defying since it could solve the mysteries of the dao and understand the void as well as examine the changes of nature and sense the heaven and earth! She had cultivated this mirror-form constitution to a very high level, resulting in a technique that frightened the courage out of others.</p>
 <p>At this time, two people walked out from a pavilion. It was Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao who were captured earlier. They looked sluggish as if they were puppets as they stood behind Gongsun Meiyu.</p>
 <p>“Here are the ones you’re looking for. Unfortunately, they are my slaves now.” Meiyu’s smile was bewitching. The bright mirror behind her was even more influential as it robbed others of their will.</p>
 <p>She viciously chuckled and continued: “Since you have killed my maid, your friends will be my new slaves. I will torture them until they choose the sweet release of death.”</p>
 <p>Many charming spirits shuddered after seeing the two in a trance. A big shot murmured: “The Seductive Gaze of the divine reflection...”</p>
 <p>The Seductive Gaze was Gongsun Meiyu’s terrifying art. She was born with a natural aptitude to be an enchantress and cultivated her mirror into this type of gaze. She was able to bewitch and control people to freely use as her puppets.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye grimaced after seeing the two standing behind her and coldly uttered: “You’re courting death.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Is that so?” Meiyu smiled in response: “If you fall into my hands, I will show you a fate worse than death.”</p>
 <p>With that, she smiled ominously and ordered: “You two, go kill him.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao immediately rushed out after hearing her command. They ferociously lunged for Li Qiye. Even though they weren’t particularly strong, especially Zhang Baitu who was quite weak, they used everything they had in order to kill Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye simply lowered both of his hands and immobilized the two on the spot. In the blink of an eye, his eyes shot out two rays of laws that struck their foreheads.</p>
 <p>With the sound of something unlocking, the two of them seemed to be struck by lightning and took several steps back.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble.” Both of them woke up right away with a clear pair of eyes. Li Qiye was able to dispel their confusion without a doubt.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye then started walking towards Gongsun Meiyu.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You are unexpectedly capable.” Meiyu was actually startled from this, but she maintained a confident appearance and revealed a seductive smile.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1261: Crushing Your Head</b></p>
 <p>“Buzz!” Gongsun Meiyu’s divine mirror became dazzling and illuminated the entire garden. The whole scene turned as white as snow; the spectators had a hard time keeping their eyes open.</p>
 <p>An eye emerged from her mirror. This extremely beautiful and spirited eye turned seductive in an instant. Its extraordinary splendor would cause people to instantly lose their way.</p>
 <p>“Watch out!” Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao both shouted in horror. They had suffered under her technique before and knew just how terrifying it was.</p>
 <p>However, Jian Xiaotie quickly dragged them away from the fight.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, do you really want to hit me?” Meiyu’s voice was seductive to the bones. It caused others to feel weak and caused their souls to leave their bodies. Her beautiful eyes emitted strange yet enchanting glows like the limpid autumn water.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stopped and stared obsessively at her. In a short period of time, her eyes became even more charming. It sent waves right into Li Qiye’s eyes in order to captivate him completely.</p>
 <p>“You are so beautiful.” The confused Li Qiye murmured to himself while standing there motionlessly.</p>
 <p>“So frightening.” Many people gasped before this scene. She could control the enemy without the need to fight at all.</p>
 <p>Meiyu sneered after seeing Li Qiye falling under her control and voiced her disdain: “And here I thought that you were actually strong. You can’t even handle a single blow, such a dao heart is not worth mentioning.”</p>
 <p>Feiyan coldly glared at him. Li Qiye was a dead man in her eyes, she could do whatever she wanted to him.</p>
 <p>“Sister Shangguan, you can torture him however you want now.” Meiyu revealed her faint, enchanting smile again.</p>
 <p>However, this charming smile seemed very scary to the spectators. The Seductive Gaze in her divine reflection was too much. Once her opponent lost their mind, she could manipulate them to her whim.</p>
 <p>“Come over here.” She gently beckoned him over.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye seemed incredibly sluggish while being completely under her control. After hearing her order, he slowly walked towards her.</p>
 <p>Both Baitu and Yujiao were pale from fear as they cried out: “Young Noble!” However, Jian Xiaotie prevented them from trying to help him.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye stood before her. She looked at her puppet and felt quite pleased with herself before smiling to say: “Even if you could dispel the charm, your body itself won’t be able to resist the seduction. This is the most primal power, you can’t withstand it at all.”</p>
 <p>She was completely confident in her seductive gaze. As long as one was fixated, it wouldn’t matter how powerful they were, they wouldn’t be able to control their mind. Their heart would start wavering until they fell completely under her control.</p>
 <p>She contemptuously ordered: “Okay, kneel and bow your head to apologize to Miss Shangguan until you crush your skull completely.”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” Suddenly, a hand grabbed her by the hair. This sudden development was completely unexpected. She couldn’t react in time because she was standing too close to him.</p>
 <p>“Bam!” This hand that gripped her hair slammed her head into a stone pillar until blood spattered.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Another crash could be heard. Her head was swung into the pillar again. Her face was mangled completely beyond recognition. Her initially supreme features were smashed to a pulp and now looked quite scary.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was the culprit. He easily slammed her into the pillar mercilessly.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Meiyu screamed as her blood energy erupted in order to escape his clutches. However, he shifted his grip to her neck. Under his Hell Suppressing Fist, she couldn’t move at all.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Her head slammed into a different pillar until it collapsed along with her skull. Blood and brain matter gushed out in the midst of this horrifying carnage.</p>
 <p>“Die!” Feiyan shouted and swiftly took action. She intertwined her ten fingers to form a phoenix mudra. A phoenix roar echoed in the sky; it came killing with the aura of a God-Monarch. Its sweeping momentum could shatter the cosmos and sweep through both gods and devils alike.</p>
 <p>A God-Monarch’s attack was incomparable. It could reverse the stars and flip the world over. She aimed to suppress Li Qiye with this one move in order to regain control of the situation.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at her phoenix mudra. He casually unleashed the Sky Destroyer Fist, a fist capable of shattering myriad dao and the vault of the sky with a sharp and overwhelming might.</p>
 <p>“Screech—” The phoenix cried miserably as it was split into two in an instant.</p>
 <p>After defeating the mudra, Li Qiye’s fist didn’t stop and kept flying towards Feiyan at an extreme speed.</p>
 <p>It was too fast and sharp; Feiyan was aghast. Her halos came together to form a shield to block this attack.</p>
 <p>However, the shield couldn’t stop this sharp strike. With a bang, the fist pierced through her chest. She was blown outside while her body shattered several pavilions in her path.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye didn’t pause. He slammed Meiyu into a different pillar. Pieces of her flesh continued to fly as her head was completely mashed.</p>
 <p>Such a bloody scene scared everyone out of their minds. Some couldn’t even bear to watch. Meiyu used to be an irresistible temptress, but now her head had been deformed beyond recognition. The contrast was too great.</p>
 <p>“Bam!” At this time, Meiyu’s body suddenly exploded into a blood mist. Li Qiye was forced several steps back from the explosion.</p>
 <p>“Little animal, you have angered me!” An endless radiance blossomed from the bloody mist. Meiyu once again appeared before everyone.</p>
 <p>Her aura turned even more brilliant and her charm was amplified. Each inch of her skin became even whiter and more perfect. She intentionally revealed herself to the crowd. The spectators felt their blood boiling after seeing her cleavage. Her sweet fragrance assaulted and mesmerized them as well.</p>
 <p>This was the ultimate form of her seductive gaze. With her true fate at work, she was able to exert her seductive gaze to its limit. Her divine reflection projected itself on the sky and turned into a gigantic mirror. It poured down an incomparable light that was concentrated on Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>At this moment, many cultivators in the garden felt their manhoods rise; they were immediately seduced by her sweet scent.</p>
 <p>“Little animal, die!” Meiyu’s eyes were sparkling. Her temptation manifested into a physical form like a heavenly worm spitting out its strings to wrap around Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Insignificant trick.” Li Qye didn’t even lift a brow. With a buzz, his inner physique emerged. Universal laws began to suppress the heavens. When the Hell Suppressing Godly Physique came out, Li Qiye seemed to turn into an oppressive god.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” He mercilessly stomped down on Meiyu.</p>
 <p>“Activate!” Meiyu responded with a cry. The mirror in the sky shifted and illuminated Li Qiye even more.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” It didn’t matter how strong her mirror was since it was useless before Li Qiye’s physique. She was instantly trampled beneath his foot.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly uttered: “You shouldn’t have schemed against my people.”</p>
 <p>“You…” Meiyu screamed and wiggled back and forth in order to escape. Alas, she couldn’t move at all due to the weight of the Immortal Physique.</p>
 <p>“Little friend, show mercy.” An old man suddenly appeared in the garden. He reached out towards Li Qiye in order to save Meiyu.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye spread out his palm and a black hole emerged and instantly engulfed this man. Under the Heaven Devourer Evil Fist, even this old man could do nothing but accept his banishment.</p>
 <p>“Ancestor!” Jian Xiaotie was shocked to see the banishment.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye insipidly said: “No one can save you.” The Hell Suppressing Physique activated and came crashing down, obliterating Meiyu.</p>
 <p>“No!” She screamed before her death. Her true fate was shattered and turned into bright particles that slowly dispersed. There was not the slightest trace of her left in the aftermath.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1262: The Person In The Coffin</b></p>
 <p>The entire scene was eerily quiet after Meiyu’s particles dispersed. The crowd could hear each other breathing.</p>
 <p>There was no other sound because people had yet to return from their shock.</p>
 <p>Feiyan, on the other hand, noticed that the situation was quite dire after her chest was penetrated. She immediately ran for dear life without pausing at all. At this moment, she didn’t give a damn about maintaining the appearance of a God-Monarch.</p>
 <p>Eventually, people calmed down and noticed the messy garden. They stared in a daze at this astonishing event.</p>
 <p>They all knew about Meiyu’s cultivation, and her seductive gaze was even more terrifying. As for Shangguan Feiyan, despite being an Intermediate Monarch, she was still not a match for Li Qiye and was suppressed after a single exchange.</p>
 <p>One could say that she was being careless and didn’t use her weapons. Nevertheless, she was strong enough that her bare hands could still slay ordinary paragons. Thus, it was surprising that she suffered against Li Qiye and was forced to flee.</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu and Hong Yujiao were slack-jawed and couldn’t react in a long time. They knew that Li Qiye was very strong, but not to this level. He crushed Meiyu like an ant!</p>
 <p>Earlier, they were worried that he might be manipulated by her seductive gaze. It looked like their anxiety was needless since Li Qiye was only pretending earlier.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” When everyone was still stunned, the void opened and an old man walked out. It was the person Li Qiye banished right before finishing off Meiyu. He was able to escape from deep space without suffering any damage in a leisurely manner — this was indicative of his great power.</p>
 <p>Despite his gray hair, his complexion was still good for he was in high spirits and had a youthful vigor. Despite restraining his terrifying aura, just his eyes alone could shatter stars and create a grand dao. His gaze alone was enough to instill cold chills into others.</p>
 <p>An old paragon recognized him and murmured: “The Jian Grandfather...”</p>
 <p>He was the current master of the Jian Clan, the reason for this celebration — Jian Longwei.</p>
 <p>“Friend, you have crossed the line.” Jian Longwei couldn’t help but shake his head: “This is stirring the hornet's nest, a great catastrophe. I’m afraid no one in the human race can protect you when it has escalated to this level.”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei had no hostility against Li Qiye. In fact, he even liked the guy for being so gifted. Unfortunately, he had killed Meiyu and gravely wounded Feiyan. This was offending two great powers in the Heaven Spirit World. Even Jian Longwei would have a difficult time protecting him after this major event.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and replied: “Only the Roaring Conch, it can’t be considered a catastrophe.”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei didn’t know how to respond after seeing Li Qiye’s relaxed demeanor. He assumed that this was a case of a calf not being afraid of a tiger and said: “The Roaring Conch can command a hundred tribes, to oppose them is to seek death—”</p>
 <p>“Longwei, leave.” Before he could finish, a feeble voice sounded in his mind. This voice was not loud and only Jian Longwei could hear it.</p>
 <p>However, he seemed to have been struck by lightning after hearing this voice. He even thought that he had misheard and found it completely unbelievable. This matter actually alerted their progenitor!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye casually pointed forward and a portal appeared, then he disappeared inside it right away.</p>
 <p>Many couldn’t react in time after the portal went away, so they just stood there looking silly.</p>
 <p>“So strong.” Eventually, a person murmured after their mind returned: “No wonder why he dared to help the Peacock Tree refine a billion Teeming Fish. This is a mass murderer, a death god. No, we have to call him the Fiercest!”</p>
 <p>“Fiercest.” Someone carefully thought over this title and found that it was very fitting. Gongsun Meiyu was the Profound Monarch’s favorite concubine, but Li Qiye killed her without a care. Just how decisive and ruthless was he? Such a person was indeed worthy of being called “Fiercest.”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei regained his composure as well and told Jian Xiaotie: “Xiaotie, take care of the guests.”</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>In the depths of the Jian Clan was a forbidden ground. A pond was sealed in this place, but it was more apt to call it a coffin made out of water.</p>
 <p>This coffin was in the center and emitted a flashing amber hue. Each ray of light seemed tangible.</p>
 <p>This liquid amber coffin was so strong that even the seal couldn’t contain it completely. People could still feel the faint immortal fragrance of a dragon’s saliva. After catching a whiff, they would feel their bloodline become several times stronger as if they were about to turn into a true dragon. They would feel that dragons were surging through the blood in their veins.</p>
 <p>An old man dressed in a simple style was sleeping inside this coffin. Despite his humble robes, he had the image of a stately emperor. It was as if he had once soared above the nine heavens, rising above the world; he was a natural born leader.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.” A portal appeared and Li Qiye came out of it. He went in front of the water coffin to look at the old man before slowly sitting down and giving a gentle sigh after a while.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The sound of water splashing came about. The old man submerged in this coffin floated above its surface and opened his eyes, revealing his devastating power.</p>
 <p>He wanted to sit up, but Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “Jian Wen, there’s no need for formalities. If you climb out, it will be problematic to reseal you, so just lie there.”</p>
 <p>He rested his head down and emotionally looked at Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, it really is you. You have regained your real body.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat there in a carefree manner and nodded: “It is thanks to Lil’ Blackie. He paid a great price.”</p>
 <p>The old man in the coffin gently sighed in response: “Your Excellency, everything Blackie had was thanks to you. You gave him life, gave him invincibility. What he did was simply to repay you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat there and watched his friend who had grown old. He had seen this kind of thing too many times already.</p>
 <p>“Time is merciless. Even the old man’s dragon saliva cannot seal you much longer.” Li Qiye lamented: “You are now old, no longer as mighty as before.”</p>
 <p>The old man smiled in response: “I’m quite satisfied after living for so long. It is all due to the blessings of Your Excellency and Master.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye agreed: “That old man indeed treated you as his own. It looks like I was right to leave you and your sister to him.”</p>
 <p>The old man chuckled. Even a powerful existence like him still smiled like a child before Li Qiye; it was as if he had returned to the past.</p>
 <p>Back then, they were vagabonds without a home. Their days were filled with anxiety and fear, running from one place to another until they met a certain crow. That was the day that they found peace and understood what the word “happiness” meant.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, have you visited Big Sis?” The old man showed a pure smile like a little boy.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was quiet for a while before nodding his head: “Yes. I didn’t want to return after all these years, but I still had to bid her a final farewell.”</p>
 <p>The old man pondered as well before replying: “Big Sis had no regrets. She only lamented the fact that she couldn't surpass her final dao test in her heart in order to accompany you to the very end. She wanted to apologize to you for being an obstacle to your eternal path.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently sighed: “Just let the past go, I don’t blame her either. I have forgotten about such distant matters. If I took everything to heart, I would never be at peace.”</p>
 <p>The old man happily added: “I have always thought that Your Excellency would never return and that I wouldn’t be able to see you again. I’m quite content now to see you one last time.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded but stayed quiet.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the old man softly asked: “Your Excellency, are you here to say goodbye?”</p>
 <p>“You can say that.” Li Qiye affirmed: “It might be for good this time. Seeing you one last time will fulfill one of my wishes.”</p>
 <p>He asked with a very strange and complicated expression: “Are you going up there now? It is a world where gods and emperors coexist...”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1263: Jian Wendi</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled after seeing the old man’s dazed appearance and casually commented: “You said that your big sis couldn’t cross the final hurdle, but isn’t it the same for you?”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, you are right about that. It is the same for me, please don’t laugh.” The old man regained his composure and smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve in response: “If you wish to know, I can tell you.”</p>
 <p>“No…” The old man shook his head with a firm demeanor: “I don’t want to know nor do I want to ask a single thing! He is he and I am I. Even if he was an Immortal Emperor admired by the masses, he is but a stranger in my mind!”</p>
 <p>He resolutely declared: “Even though his blood runs through my veins, in my eyes, I have severed all ties with him, and so have my sister and mother. The moment we had to flee for dear life that day was the moment we were no longer related to him. My surname is Jian, my sister’s surname is Jian, and so is our mother’s!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sighed after seeing his expression: “Just let it go. Everything will be buried in the river of time.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is over already, who will still remember or know about it?” The dazed old man quietly whispered: “But my big sis was haunted by this shadow her whole life. She was born to be extraordinary, destined to be great, yet she chose to live a mundane life! It was all because she had a father who wanted to kill his own daughter!”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi was the name of this old man. He was also the progenitor of the Jian Clan and Jian Wenxin’s younger brother.</p>
 <p>The origin of the Jian Clan had always been a secret in the Heaven Spirit World. No one knew where they came from.</p>
 <p>In fact, this matter hid a great secret that those who knew about would rather keep silent. The Jian Clan came from the Mortal Emperor World, and Jian Wendi and Jian Wenxin were the children of an Immortal Emperor. Unfortunately, they couldn’t enjoy their lives as a prince and princess.</p>
 <p>This emperor used murder to prove his dao. The moment he reached the top, an inner demon appeared that he failed to defeat. Due to his murderous dao, he was doomed to a path of ruthless killing.</p>
 <p>Before his ascension, he already had a wife and children. Because of this, he couldn’t reach the ultimate state of emotionlessness and ruthlessness. In order to do this, he had to remove his restraints. Thus, before the grand dao, he wanted to sever all emotions by killing his own blood in order to prove his dao.</p>
 <p>Alas, he failed at first. His followers were able to save his family and take them away from him. However, he was only half a step away from becoming an emperor at this point, so he was completely unbeatable.</p>
 <p>Those who protected his family couldn’t escape his wrath. From then on, Jian Wendi’s mother fled with her two children all across the nine worlds.</p>
 <p>Later on, they met a crow who gave them the idea of faking their own deaths in order to escape.</p>
 <p>Their father truly thought that they had died, so he finally defeated his inner demon to prove his dao and became an invincible Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>After becoming an emperor, he became even more powerful. He was able to calculate his own bloodline and realized that his son and daughter were still alive.</p>
 <p>The consequences were easy to imagine. All of the seniors that protected his wife and children died in the battle. The Dark Crow had to appear once again to rescue them from his clutches.</p>
 <p>Because their father was an emperor, he was invincible in that generation with nobody capable of stopping him.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the bloodline of their father ran through their bodies, so they couldn’t escape his vision no matter where they went.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, in order to escape the hunt, their mother committed suicide while their bloodline was sealed by the Dark Crow. He then entrusted the children to another extremely powerful being that eventually hid them away.</p>
 <p>Because their bloodline had been sealed and their bodies disappeared into the most secretive dimension in this world, even the emperor couldn’t calculate where they were hiding via their bloodline.</p>
 <p>In the end, the emperor gave up. The sister and brother finally managed to escape this calamity.</p>
 <p>As more generations went by, their sealed bloodline was eventually unlocked. They were able to appear in this world once more.</p>
 <p>The invincible existence that had protected them all this time took them in as disciples. Because of this, these two were able to start the Jian Clan.</p>
 <p>“It’s over, everything is now gone.” Jian Wendi eventually shook his head and said: “I am a member of the Jian Clan, the past no longer has anything to do with me.”</p>
 <p>Ever since the start of their escape, the two had decided to take their mother’s surname in order to cut off all relations with their father.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye felt a bit sorrowful while looking at Jian Wendi. Even though the two of them were able to escape, the whole experience still cast an indelible shadow that hung over their hearts for the rest of their lives.</p>
 <p>Her sister was born to be extraordinary and extraordinary she was. Alas, she ultimately pursued the peaceful life of a mortal. Because of this, she gave up competing for the Heaven’s Will and a chance to become an emperor. Nevertheless, due to her great wisdom, she couldn’t truly experience this peaceful lifestyle.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Jian Wendi handled it much better. Even though he couldn’t surpass the dao block in his heart, the Jian Clan — under his leadership — still prospered and became an inheritance that lasted to this day.</p>
 <p>After a good while, Jian Wendi commented with regret: “It is a pity that I cannot follow you, Your Excellency, to serve you during your journey…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye waved his sleeve and flatly said: “It is enough for you to stay here and protect the Jian Clan. As for paying me back, your sister has done plenty. You don’t owe me anything.”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi disagreed: “No, Your Excellency. In my mind, you are my second parent. Without you, my sister and I wouldn’t have survived and my Jian Clan definitely wouldn’t be what it is today. I only hate the fact that I don’t wish to go further, I can’t face it!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sighed: “I’m also very happy to see the current Jian Clan. This place can be considered my home as well.”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi smiled innocently like a child in front of Li Qiye. It was thanks to Li Qiye that the two of them were able to have the courage to live on.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi issued a command: “Tell Longwei and Xiaotie to come here.”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei eventually entered with Jian Xiaotie behind him. The two were quite startled to see Li Qiye casually sitting there.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei was eight thousand years old now, but the times he had met the progenitor could be counted on one’s hand. Outside of earth-shattering events, the progenitor normally wouldn’t summon him.</p>
 <p>As for Jian Xiaotie, he had only met the progenitor once. It was during his coming of age. From then on, he wasn’t summoned again.</p>
 <p>In fact, not many members of any clan would be able to see their progenitors. This included the ancestors as well.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi ordered the two: “Kneel before His Excellency.”</p>
 <p>Even though the two didn’t know the reason, they didn’t dare to disobey their progenitor, so they respectfully kneeled before Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi slowly said: “Longwei is the current clan master while Xiaotie is the next, so you two should know some things about our clan. His Excellency before you is our benefactor and the master of our clan! Our clan was able to exist because of his protection. Remember our eternal creed, His Excellency is our lord and his commands are my commands.”</p>
 <p>The two of them were inevitably shocked to hear this. This was especially true for Longwei since he had been the clan master for a long time, so he was privy to a few secrets. He knew that there was a great and mysterious character that helped create the Jian Clan.</p>
 <p>He didn’t expect that he would be able to see this legendary existence in his lifetime.</p>
 <p>“This disciple greets Your Excellency.” He calmed down and bowed his head towards Li Qiye. Each bow was very sincere as his head touched the ground. Each knock seemingly came from his heart.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency…” Jian Xiaotie also did the same. He didn’t know as much as Longwei, but as the successor, he had still heard of a few things about this legend.</p>
 <p>He didn’t expect to see a mythical being that could even ambush Immortal Emperors. Moreover, this existence had been right beside him for the last several days.</p>
 <p>“Rise.” Li Qiye accepted the grand gesture from these two and gently waved his hand.</p>
 <p>After these two stood up, Jian Wendi ordered: “Take your leave, I will talk to His Excellency now.”</p>
 <p>They motioned a respectful gesture before quietly retreating.</p>
 <p>“The children are filial and gifted at both fighting and scheming, so I am not worried about the Jian Clan at all.” Li Qiye nodded: “As long as the old geezer is still there, the Jian Clan just needs to do its own thing, nothing will be able to cause trouble for the clan as it continues to stand strong.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1264: Garden In The Sky</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat together with Jian Wendi. The two of them chatted about different matters and the Jian Clan. Unwittingly, the two of them returned to the past when Jian Wendi was still a child while Li Qiye was still the same as ever.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, are you really going up again?” Jian Wendi knew the answer, but he still had to ask again.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled: “Yes, what must come shall come. I have to face it after all. You should know that no one can stop my journey to the very end. I am destined to do so because someone must.”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi knew that nothing could change this. The truth was that he knew what the answer was long ago.</p>
 <p>In the past, his sister had tried to stop him as well, but like Li Qiye said, no one was able to stop his destiny.</p>
 <p>“An age of gods and emperors together…” Jian Wendi sighed and didn’t know what to say. Perhaps he should wish Li Qiye luck.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and smiled: “It is a brilliant era that makes the blood boil. At the same time, it is also a cruel place. The greater the momentum, the more merciless it is.”</p>
 <p>“I know, it is a shame that I won’t be able to see the scene of dragons competing against tigers with my own eyes.” Jian Wendi nodded softly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied: “You had the chance back then, you could have avoided Hong Tian’s generation and came out a few years later to become an emperor. Then you would have been able to see this brilliant era.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Jian Wendi revealed a smile that encompassed many different emotions. There was a mix of inexplicable bitterness yet acceptance as he answered: “Immortal Emperor… so what? Invincibility, so what? It is only an ephemeral firework blossoming above the river of time. I am very content with how many descendants I have now. There’s nothing else I would ask for.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye felt sentimental while looking at Jian Wendi. Neither of the brother and sister could overcome the void in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Their father had left an unsurpassable shadow in their minds. It caused them to prefer a mundane life untempted by invincibility. Both were apprehensive about becoming an existence like their father.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi regretfully said: “I do wish that I could follow Your Excellency to the end of the world like Immortal Emperor Min Ren and the others.”</p>
 <p>“I’m very happy about what you have today. Your Jian Clan is prosperous and stronger than anything.” Li Qiye happily smiled: “Plus, even if you become an Immortal Emperor, I wouldn’t want you to follow me to the end of the world. Like Immortal Emperor Min Ren and Empress Hong Tian, they have their own paths as well.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly explained: “The ultimate war is my personal ambition and desire. It has nothing to do with others, so I don’t want to tie them to my war chariot.”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi quietly nodded. There were too many things beyond his reach since someone as extraordinary as him was still trapped by his fate.</p>
 <p>After a while, Li Qiye smiled and asked: “Has the old man run out again?”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi smiled back and replied: “It’s only natural that after being still for so long, Master would want to take a break and play outside.” [1. There is an idiom that is quite difficult to translate. The meaning is about a pendulum swinging from the extreme; the raw translation would be “motion from stillness”. In this case, Wendi is saying that his master has been quiet/reclusive for very long, so he naturally will want to come out and play as this is the natural order. I couldn’t really incorporate this particular idiom into the sentence without it sounding extremely rigid.]</p>
 <p>“That’s good, I want to see him.” Li Qiye chuckled.</p>
 <p>With that, he gently tapped Jian Wendi’s shoulder and calmly said: “I should go now. Take care.”</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi was quiet for a moment before nodding: “Your Excellency, take care. There is still a ways to go, I believe that you will eventually become invincible.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smilingly said before turning to leave: “Yes, nothing can stop my determination. Take care and live well!”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency!” He only managed to take a few steps before Jian Wendi shouted: “Will, will I be able to see you again?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t turn around, but he responded in a carefree manner: “I don’t know. Just consider this as our final farewell so that you can stop worrying about it.”</p>
 <p>With that, he casually created a portal and disappeared.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi continued lying there in silence. Time seemed to have stopped for him.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he quietly murmured: “See you again, Father.”</p>
 <p>Tears inadvertently wetted his eyes as they closed.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The water splashed again as he sank into his water coffin to re-enter deep slumber. Perhaps when he woke again, it would be a different era.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>In Rainbow City, there was a place where no one could visit. Many people didn’t know about it, including those from the Jian Clan. However, among those who did know, they called it the highest city or the final city in this region. Of course, some also referred to it as the place above the clouds.</p>
 <p>It was not suitable to call this place a city since it was more of a garden floating in the clouds. At least, in appearance it was.</p>
 <p>This great garden was not located in Dragonhark, Dragonwell, or even Dragonspring. It was floating in an unknown location.</p>
 <p>Odd flowers and strange grasses were in full bloom. The whole garden had a wafting floral fragrance. Elegant and rich scents came from these flowers alongside very strange fragrances. This place had all kinds of rare species of the nine worlds. In the middle was a wooden house built in an exquisite manner.</p>
 <p>It was difficult to imagine the craftsmanship that had gone into it. Perhaps during the building process, each wooden plank, beam, and column were dedicated for this building. Their weight, size, and appearance were scrutinized with an incomparably strict standard. The weight had to be perfect in order to make this house into a work of art.</p>
 <p>There were many busy figures in this garden. Some were watering the flowers while others were taking care of the weeds or trimming the bushes. A few were loosening the soil and more were catching worms…</p>
 <p>On a careful inspection, these busy people were all old men. Gray robes, huge coats, sleeveless shirts… all of their outfits were different as well.</p>
 <p>They also looked different in terms of figures. Some were normal while others were incredibly thin or fat. However, at a second glance, regardless of their uniform or body shape, there was something very similar about them. It was difficult to pinpoint the similarity; perhaps it was their silhouette. This familiar contour gave others the feeling that they had seen these old men before.</p>
 <p>In fact, if people were to think about it for a second, they would realize that they really had seen these old men before. For example, the old man that summoned the rainbow fish, the collector at Dragonhark Valley, or the shopkeeper at Rainbow Inn. All of them gave off this sense of familiarity, a deja vu of sorts.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye appeared in this garden that was forbidden to outsiders without express permission from its master. Regardless of how powerful or heaven-defying one might be, they wouldn’t be able to enter this place.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye had a beaming smile on his face while looking at the busy old men in this garden. He didn’t greet them and only headed straight for the wooden house.</p>
 <p>The old men ignored Li Qiye as well and continued with their tasks as if they didn’t see his arrival.</p>
 <p>In front of this cabin was a tea table with two wooden chairs. On one side was an old man fanning a fire to boil his tea. All of his attention was on this task. His eyes seemed to be jumping along with the fire while he was unaware of Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t break the old man’s focus and only smiled as he sat down. The wooden chair was so comfortable that it made people want to close their eyes to sleep. It was as if it was specifically tailored for Li Qiye. It fit his body perfectly. Just a bit longer would be too big while an inch less would make it too narrow. There was no room for criticism.</p>
 <p>He slowly closed his eyes as if to sleep. Meanwhile, the old man making his tea still didn’t notice Li Qiye. All of his focus was on making his tea.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the old man finally finished and added the tea leaves. A sweet fragrance came out as he poured himself a cup and one for Li Qiye as well.</p>
 <p>The steam that rose from the hot tea actually condensed above the cups to form dragons. One could even faintly hear the wondrous cries of these dragons.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1265: Old Man</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye seemed to wake up as he accepted the teacup. He gently took a sip, letting the tea seep into his belly. There was an indescribable comfort that stemmed from the perfect temperature.</p>
 <p>Dragon cries resounded from his belly as if he had just swallowed a gigantic dragon.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise: “A great tea like this dragon tea can only be found in this place.” The aftertaste was incredible as well.</p>
 <p>He finally opened his eyes fully and found the garden to be at peace. The old men that were gardening earlier had all disappeared, only Li Qiye and the old tea-maker were left.</p>
 <p>At this time, the old man seated himself in the other chair and slowly savored the taste of his tea in a natural and leisurely manner. It was as if he was drinking a tea of immortals. In fact, his tea was not far from being an immortal tea. Even Immortal Emperors wouldn’t necessarily be able to drink his dragon tea.</p>
 <p>After finishing his cup, Li Qiye sighed with great satisfaction. The old man finished as well.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and teased: “Old man, it seems that you can’t stand the loneliness again? Is that why you are playing around like this?”</p>
 <p>The old man lied down comfortably in his chair and chuckled: “Being in bed for too long makes my arms and legs numb, so I had to get up to do some work. Toiling is unavoidable in life after all.”</p>
 <p>“Being hard at work is good, I was actually afraid you would panic from having nothing to do.” Li Qiye smiled back.</p>
 <p>The old man happily looked at the countless strange flowers in the garden and said in a carefree manner: “What can I do with these old bones of mine? Don’t worry about that, Crow. Plus, I can’t leave the Giant Dragon Mountain either way, so I’m just running around and playing the merchant — just some coolie’s works.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed; he was truly enjoying the carefree atmosphere at the garden. This was a conversation with someone at the same level as him, yet they weren’t enemies. It was a very enjoyable matter.</p>
 <p>“I thought you would continue to plot and hide behind the scenes until all the old men take action. I didn’t expect you to come out in this generation.” The old man stated: “It is quite surprising that you were able to resist the supreme artifact in the Immortal Demon Grotto as well. I actually thought that you would return there and try to seize it.”</p>
 <p>“Am I really that kind of person?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “I have always been upright, I’m not the type to scheme like that.”</p>
 <p>“Upright?” The old man burst out in laughter: “If a crow like you claims to be upright, then even the high heavens would start tearing up from laughing.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was amused as well. Eventually, he replied: “After I left, that existence in the grotto still figured out some way to make my situation very unstable. Lil’ Blackie was too anxious. In a fit of rage, he recklessly charged in there.” He sighed softly at this point.</p>
 <p>“That brat always treated you as a father.” The old man dismissively said: “Outside of that little girl, nothing else is as important to him as you, so of course he did what he did.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied with remorse: “Back then when I took him to the Mortal Emperor World, I only hoped for him to be able to soar to the nine heavens like an eagle. Unfortunately, he couldn’t let go of a few things and decided to stay in the Mortal Emperor World. Because of that, well, you know what happened to him afterward.”</p>
 <p>“His decision also made you lose the opportunity to seize the grotto. Haven’t you always been scheming for that item? Unfortunately, you failed.” The old man stood up and chuckled.</p>
 <p>“It is true that I want the item, but only if it doesn't risk many people’s lives. I can only say that I got very close to doing so. I guess certain things were doomed from the start.” Li Qiye gently shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Heh, this is fine too. If it wasn’t for Lil’ Blackie getting you out of there and, by chance, if you actually obtained that item, the old heavens would turn blind. If you could obtain all the supreme items that you wanted, how could others bear such injustice? Even the villainous heavens wouldn’t want to live on in such an unfair world.” The old man cheerfully gloated at Li Qiye’s misfortune.</p>
 <p>“Just let the past go. I’ve grown tired of living after such a long life anyway.” Li Qiye smiled: “Since Lil’ Blackie has saved me, I’ll just live freely through this generation and go all out. I’ll finish what must be done, there’s no need to worry about life and death afterward.” [1. This sentence might not make sense unless you remember the artifact that is in the Immortal Demon Grotto and what it does.]</p>
 <p>The old man emotionally sighed after insipidly stating: “Yes, it is tiresome to live for so long.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and teased: “I see that you are living quite well. You sleep for a bit then run out and play for a bit. How comfortable and carefree.”</p>
 <p>The old man glared at him in response: “When the villainous heavens played me like this, what else can I do? I can’t die even if I want to, and if I want to live, I can only stay in this place! Luckily, my descendants didn’t let me down and managed to pass down my bloodline, so I don’t have many regrets.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him and asked: “Have you not thought about going strong one more time to the end of the world?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, Dark Crow, don’t try to drag me down with you. This is your war, not mine. I’m just an ordinary old geezer now.” The old man chortled: “I am living a nice family life. Running around when I want to, making some tea when I feel like it, and sometimes beating up a few bad kids who won’t listen — I’m quite content with this kind of life already.”</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe it.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Back in that distant era, a dragon demon dared to fight all the way to the nine firmaments and opposed the villainous heavens himself. Where is that dragon now?”</p>
 <p>“Damned crow, there’s no need to goad me.” The old man didn't become angry. Instead, he grinned and said: “I have no more aspirations and have nothing to say about my loss back then. I don’t have any grievances about being imprisoned here either. After all, I was not as strong as I imagined, but I can handle losing.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye pondered for a bit before nodding his head: “This is what I admire about you the most, you can see things clearly and are very open-minded. It is true that there is no humiliation in losing to the villainous heavens. This path is very difficult. For millions of years, countless others have tried, and just as many have become bones.”</p>
 <p>“In the end, how many are still brooding right now?” Li Qiye gently sighed: “Being able to let things go is the sign of a real hero. I myself can’t get over this hurdle, I just can’t gracefully admit defeat and will try to get up from where I’ve fallen. No matter what it is or who it is, I will start from the beginning to sweep through it all by cutting down all those who try to stop me!”</p>
 <p>“But being able to give up is really nice, really nice…” Li Qiye lamented: “By letting things go, everything else will feel acceptable in life. Or rather, many other things are insignificant compared to just being alive. As long as you don’t care, things that used to be important will no longer matter. Like the drifting clouds, they won’t be worth mentioning.”</p>
 <p>“Damned crow, it is not the same for you.” The old man smiled and replied: “I have lost completely — this made me realize that I have other things to protect in life, such as my children.”</p>
 <p>“If you give up, you would be wasting your immortality.” The old man reflected: “If possible, you should gamble everything just once. If you win, you will have everything. If you lose, at least lose everything as well after utilizing everything at your disposal.”</p>
 <p>“After suffering an utter defeat, you might be able to see through it and let go.” With that, he smiled: “When you don’t have anything left to bet with, you will have no choice but to give up.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe.” Li Qiye had a somber expression as he responded: “If I’m able to put everything on the table, then I might as well gamble it all away just once. When Wenxin asked me why I can’t stop, the truth is that I didn’t know back then either. Perhaps it is because I haven’t tasted true defeat, being left with nothing but empty hands. Maybe this defeat will even end with my death.”</p>
 <p>“Regardless of victory or defeat or even death, there is nothing to be afraid of.” The old man said: “Your life has been quite productive. For many generations, who has led a more brilliant life than you? You have experienced and done everything possible. Even if you stay as an ant, it would still have been a good life.”</p>
 <p>“An ant trapped between the heaven and earth…” Li Qiye eventually shook his head and smiled before putting on a determined look: “Even as an ant, I still don’t want to hide. One day, I will stand above all else. My destiny is my own, the heavens will not decide my fate!”</p>
 <p>“That’s what I want to hear.” The old man laughed in agreement: “Even as an ant, you would still rather be an extraordinary ant than an insignificant one.”</p>
 <p>“Well said.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Yes, I want to be an extraordinary ant!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1266: A Joke For The Ages</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye and the old man were quite pleased with their statements. They glanced at each other and laughed heartily; tears even came out.</p>
 <p>They had experienced countless years and hardships. Once upon a time, they were the rulers at the peak of this world. Very rarely would they be able to laugh this sincerely.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of outsiders, they were either unfathomable or too stern and stately. Others seldom spotted them laughing like this to the point their stomachs hurt.</p>
 <p>They finally stopped after a long while.</p>
 <p>“An ant between the heaven and earth, eh?” It took quite some time before the old man stopped grinning.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye cheerfully added with a boisterous chuckle: “The villainous heavens is just a wretch!”</p>
 <p>The two of them became tired from their own ruckus and sat back down to rest again with their eyes closed. It seemed that this kind of indulgence felt quite good for them.</p>
 <p>In fact, this burst of laughter was very precious. As overlords, they rarely expressed their true feelings before others; they could only reveal their true selves before someone of the same level.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled and spoke after resting for a bit: “Crow, in these long and boring years, it is a great joy in life to have met you.”</p>
 <p>The gentle breeze blew by. Its gentle coolness was quite comforting, as if it was blowing all worldly troubles away.</p>
 <p>“Geezer, I agree that there are fewer than few people who I can sit down and have a talk with.” Li Qiye still had his eyes closed as he happily replied: “Life is less boring from knowing you.”</p>
 <p>The years were too long. For both the old man and the Dark Crow, there weren’t too many people that they could talk and laugh so freely with.</p>
 <p>The world might be vast, but how many were actually qualified to become their friends?</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t respond; he seemed to have fallen asleep in his wooden chair. Li Qiye did the same while basking in the sea breeze.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye commented: “Geezer, how come I don’t see as many clouds and mists in your mountain range this time? Are all of your kids staying at home obediently?”</p>
 <p>“A wicked person just arrived. What if those little monkeys run wild and choose to be blind? You would then teach them a lesson by peeling their skin. I would lose all face if that were to happen, so I told them to play nice at home.” The old man answered with a smile.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled and leisurely said: “Don’t worry, with our friendship, I would show you some consideration. Even if I peeled their dragon scales, I would still spare their lives.”</p>
 <p>The old man smiled in response. A bit later, he flatly asked: “Crow, you didn’t come here just to visit this old man, right?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye cheerfully replied: “Forget it, there’s no need to crawl out, your appearance is too terrifying.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, don’t be so sure. Maybe one day, you will look even more horrifying than me. The villainous heavens won’t let you off so easily given your plans.” The old man laughed back.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued: “We’ll talk again when that day comes. After all, the heavens has never forgiven anyone, so I don’t need it to show me any mercy either.”</p>
 <p>The two of them paused their conversation again and enjoyed the serenity. Even though the outside world was endless, there was no need to worry about it in this place.</p>
 <p>“Crow, what do you want?” After a long time, the old man finally spoke in a calm and plain manner. It was as if this was just an idle conversation between old friends.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye opened his eyes to look at the drifting clouds up in the blue sky. He didn’t answer right away.</p>
 <p>“The Immortal Dragon Rune, a weapon, or maybe my lifeguarding artifacts?” The old man leisurely listed a couple items.</p>
 <p>This plain manner of speaking made it seems like the topic was insignificant, but if others were to find out that he was referring to supreme treasures, they would be scared silly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, you can keep your little items. I would be too greedy if I tried to take them away from you.” Li Qiye only smiled.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled as well and didn’t seem to care too much.</p>
 <p>“Geezer.” Eventually, Li Qiye got to the point: “Back then, that brat Bu Si came to ask you for help, correct?”</p>
 <p>It was the old man’s turn to be quiet.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled before continuing: “I don’t know what that brat was playing with or how he shattered. I don’t care what plans he left behind either, I only want to know about one thing.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it's as you guessed, I have been to the Bonesea.” The old man didn’t try to conceal this at all.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye went on: “I knew it. When his skeletal horse disappeared here, I understood some matters right away. That brat was still thinking about those things.”</p>
 <p>The old man smiled: “Bu Si’s foresight was not bad, but it is quite limited compared to yours. He was fixated on becoming immortal. However, all of this led back to one thing; it must be traced back to the source.”</p>
 <p>Immortal Emperor Bu Si had died many times just to revive again. He was a reason for awe during his generation, but in the mouth of these two, he was only a junior.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye eventually spoke: “Old man, I want you to open it for me.”</p>
 <p>“Hah, Crow, that’s easy for you to say.” The old man responded: “I have spent painstaking efforts on it already. Even though I’m not using it, who knows if I will need it in the future or not?”</p>
 <p>“I know.” Li Qiye smiled: “You aren’t sure if that day will come either, but since you aren’t using it right now, lend it to me.”</p>
 <p>“Crow, what are you thinking?” The old man was still hesitant: “Don’t tell me you are looking at the Trident? It won’t be that easy.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, old geezer, you are underestimating me too much.” Li Qiye answered: “The Trident might be nice, but I have never thought about obtaining it. I have more than enough treasures in this generation so possessing it doesn’t matter. There’s no need to suffer in the Bonesea just for the Trident.”</p>
 <p>“The Bonesea, eh.” The old man sighed after hearing this: “That day will come to Heaven Spirit after all. Many things are simply inevitable.”</p>
 <p>The Bonesea was one of the twelve burial grounds and the most dangerous place in the Heaven Spirit World. It was full of mysteries, a land where countless have fallen, but this didn’t deter people from going there.</p>
 <p>“That place isn’t pleasant at all.” Li Qiye chuckled: “But I do have to admit that it isn’t a bad location. It is worthy of making so many people drool with greed.”</p>
 <p>“Greed?” The old man chortled: “It’s the same for all twelve burial grounds, but in those devilish places, only the living can enjoy the spoils.”</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter since I’m not trying to find a nest or anything.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, there is something I need over there. Old man, you have been there many times before, so I need you to open it for me. This is the only way for me to get things done.”</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t answer; it was as if he was sleeping in his chair. Li Qiye didn’t rush him either. It seemed as if he had forgotten about his own question while enjoying the breeze.</p>
 <p>“Crow.” The old man took a long time before answering: “We might be friends. After all, I took in those two as my disciples since I needed to pass down my lineage. The brat married my daughter and this was perfect to make up for my lacking bloodline. However…”</p>
 <p>“I know, there is no free lunch.” Li Qiye replied: “Geezer, tell me what you want. As long as I can get it, I will seriously consider.”</p>
 <p>The old man lied there as if he was contemplating the issue. Eventually, he opened his mouth: “Crow, I am now old. I don’t know how much longer this old body of mine can last. I have already obtained pretty much everything I’ve ever wanted. As for treasures, they are just worldly possessions, I have no need for them.”</p>
 <p>“Old man, don’t tell me you want to betroth another daughter somewhere to me.” Li Qiye joked: “If that’s the case, then forget it.”</p>
 <p>The old man smiled and shook his head: “Come on, Crow, others don’t know who you are, but I do. If I betroth a daughter to you, she’ll just live a life of suffering! I don’t want my little girl to wash her face with tears every day.”</p>
 <p>“My little girls aren’t worthy to climb up your high branch.” The old man half-jokingly smiled and said: “I only want them to be safe and live happily.” [1. The first sentence is an expression of polite refusal, it is quite common.]</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1267: Bidding Farewell</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t mind the rejection from the old man, evident by his smile.</p>
 <p>The old man eventually continued: “Like I said, Crow, I don’t have any more pursuits, and this is the case for that item too. If you want it, then I shall perform the opening.”</p>
 <p>“I understand.” Li Qiye mused it through and said: “After all is said and done, old man, you want me to owe you a favor.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, you will owe me a favor.” The old man happily replied: “Crow, if you lose, then consider the item as a gift. But if you win... then regardless of what happens in the future, in the new world and era, just don’t forget that you owe me a favor.”</p>
 <p>He leisurely went on: “It doesn’t matter to me how much longer I have to live, I just hope that you can remember this favor and take care of my descendants. What do you think, Crow?”</p>
 <p>“Old man, in the end you just want me to babysit your descendants.” Li Qiye laughed it up and replied: “Everyone says that those who manage to grow old are all wily. You are quite calculating nowadays.”</p>
 <p>“Old people are sentimental as well.” The old man only smiled: “Even though I don’t have that many children, their very being is a treasure. If I actually die one day, perhaps they will become other people’s prey.”</p>
 <p>“Dragons, huh.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “If that day actually comes, dragon blood will indeed be very tempting. After all, who doesn’t want a piece of such a nice meal?”</p>
 <p>The old man cheerfully replied: “I do want the little monkeys to turn into true dragons one day, but even if that day comes, it will be a calamity as well. The gods and emperors will all want them.”</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye gave a carefree smile and declared: “Why not?! If I can win the final war, then nothing else will matter. I’ll just be a babysitter then; old man, you have my promise.”</p>
 <p>The old man only gave a plain smile. This was within his expectations, so he wasn’t overly surprised or lost in jubilation.</p>
 <p>The conversation stopped for a while before the old man spoke again: “About Little Jian... I’m sorry, even as her master, I was powerless to help her.”</p>
 <p>There was a doleful look on Li Qiye’s face. He eventually sighed and said: “Old man, you were a good master and did all you could for both the brat and the girl.”</p>
 <p>“There are a few uncrossable ridges in life. Not everyone can always be strong.” He helplessly lamented: “She was nearly flawless. It is a shame that she couldn’t escape the shadow of her past.”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere became solemn. There were a few things that couldn’t be changed by even the most heaven-defying of people.</p>
 <p>The old man eased up and smiled: “Well, I don't think she had any regrets even in her last moments. In fact, you might be the only one who feels remorse.”</p>
 <p>“It was her choice back then.” Li Qiye faintly smiled: “She wanted to die due to her pursuit of normality. She was a good girl and has done many things for me.”</p>
 <p>“Just dismiss the past from your mind.” The old man added: “You have always been the most important person in the girl’s heart, and she believed that she lived a fulfilling life. Despite not being able to overcome her shadow, you brought light to her world. Amidst the hues of carnage and shades of despair, you gave them life. When they were at their most vulnerable, you gave them the courage to live on.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, consign the past to oblivion.” The old man nonchalantly declared: “The brat once said, the light you have given them is brighter than the darkness of the past.”</p>
 <p>“But the light cannot shine to every corner of the world.” Li Qiye had a profound expression as he stared at the sky. It was as if he was peering through everything. After a while, he flatly replied: “There is no savior in this world. Everyone needs to rely on themselves.”</p>
 <p>The old man laughed in response: “A savior? Those types of people should go to hell! Everyone wants a savior, but such beliefs will turn this savior into a devil! They would only breed inactivity and stagnation. People should be their own saviors; if they can’t save or change their own lives, how can a ‘savior’ do anything?”</p>
 <p>“Makes sense.” Li Qiye bemoaned: “I saved the lives of those two, but could not save them from their fate.”</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” In the end, the old man playfully cursed: “Crow, our combined age is older than just about anyone, why are we bewailing like two old women? To hell with this melancholic conversation!”</p>
 <p>“Well, old people tend to blabber on and on.” Li Qiye grinned.</p>
 <p>The two ended up quietly looking at the sky as if it was the most beautiful scene in the world.</p>
 <p>This moment of solace was undisturbable. It was a time true overlords like them could find peace.</p>
 <p>After a long time, the old man spoke again: “Crow, I will not see you off. Return from whence you came.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye quipped: “Fine, it would be too scary if you climbed out of the nest. I know the way.”</p>
 <p>Just like that, Li Qiye stood up and looked at the old man to say: “Geezer, this is farewell. Perhaps this will be our last meeting.”</p>
 <p>“Take care, damned crow.” The old man responded with a smile.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded and turned around without saying anything else.</p>
 <p>“Crow!” He didn’t get far before the old man cried out. Li Qiye paused his steps.</p>
 <p>The old man sat up straight and put on a solemn expression to say: “There are some legends that you have probably heard about. Once you cross that line and reach a certain threshold, destruction is imminent.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not a legend.” Li Qiye became quite austere as well: “It is the truth and I’ll face it even when I have to cross that juncture.”</p>
 <p>The old man slowly asked: “Are you prepared?”</p>
 <p>“I shall be fearless and fight to the very end when that day comes. As long as I don’t fall, nothing will happen!” His voice resounded in the clouds.</p>
 <p>The old man softly sighed and murmured: “The inevitable will come after all. I’m afraid no one will be able to escape.”</p>
 <p>“I believe you can.” Li Qiye joked: “Old man, be ready for when it does come. I know you have the power to do so.”</p>
 <p>He left after saying this.</p>
 <p>The old man sat there in silence. After a very long time, he muttered to himself: “Either the start of a new age or the withering of all...”</p>
 <p>He ended with a woeful sigh and disappeared. The garden became extremely quiet. This was an eerie silence. If it wasn’t for the odd flowers and other vegetation here and there, people would mistake this place for a dead zone.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Li Qiye finally returned to the Jian Mansion and was immediately greeted by Jian Longwei and Jian Xiaotie. They bowed before him and said: “Your Excellency.”</p>
 <p>“No need for formalities.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “Act as before. I won’t be staying here for too long, I will be leaving after finishing some matters.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, the two couldn’t do anything except bow their heads again. They hoped that Li Qiye could stay and teach them a thing or two. In their eyes, if they could be taught by the legendary teacher of Immortal Emperors, they would gain lifelong benefits from it.</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie busily told Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, a few things have happened at Dongting Lake, so Master Hong wishes to see you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ordered: “Tell him to come and see me. Dongting Lake has ties with me, so I shall help them.”</p>
 <p>A bit later, Hong Tianzhou came running in. He quickly bowed his head after seeing Li Qiye: “Young Noble, things aren’t looking too good. Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village demand an answer from us or else they’ll send in their troops.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye had killed Shangguan Feilong and the Bloodshark Scion. This enraged these two powers, prompting them to demand that the lake hand Li Qiye over. Otherwise, they would crush the lake.</p>
 <p>“Send in their troops?” Li Qiye smiled: “Let them come so that their blood can dye the blue ocean red. This shall be a baptism for the sea demons to understand the strength of the human race.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou was shocked after hearing this. He couldn’t help but recall the events at the Peacock Land and how terrifying it must have been when a billion fish were sacrificed!</p>
 <p>“Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village are nothing.” Jian Xiaotie was stirred. He said: “Give the order, Your Excellency. Our disciples shall trample both of them with haste.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou was stunned after hearing this. Even the Jian Clan was working for Li Qiye? This was simply inconceivable to him.</p>
 <p>He calmed down and shuddered before hesitantly speaking: “I heard the Bloodshark Sovereign is a sea god…”</p>
 <p>“Just a false god.” Jian Longwei replied nonchalantly: “Does he really think he is a sea god after being recognized by the Trident? If he dares to show himself, I’ll behead him in front of Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei declared this in a matter-of-fact manner. This was enough to show the strength of their clan!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1268: Besieged</b></p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou was astonished after hearing this. If an existence like the Bloodshark Sovereign was regarded with such disdain, then just how fierce and domineering was this Jian Longwei?</p>
 <p>At the same time, he felt his blood boiling because his lake would definitely be able to overcome this crisis with the Jian Clan’s help.</p>
 <p>“I’ll do it myself.” Li Qiye voiced his refusal with a gesture and flatly said: “It is time for the sea demons to open their eyes to the proud human race. Let them know that even at the Dragon Demon Sea, humans can still suppress the heavens!”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei didn’t dare to compete against Li Qiye for this merit. They understood that this person was a supreme overlord. Even if a sea god came along, they would be annihilated. Li Qiye was someone who had killed Immortal Emperors after all!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye told Hong Tianzhou: “If the enemies come sieging, then we shall fight and bury them beneath the sea.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou opened his mouth, but no words came out due to some hesitation.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “No need for scruples, say what you want.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou took a deep breath and made up his mind: “The ancestors, they, they want to negotiate for peace and are willing to accept the demands from Wyvern and the village.”</p>
 <p>“Negotiate for peace?” Li Qiye laughed and coldly uttered: “Since when did Dongting Lake become so weak? Would your ancestors ever negotiate with their enemies? When they were still around, surrender would not cross their minds even if they were whittled down to the very last man on the battlefield! Their bones were cast from iron and their hot blood could erect the strongest citadel in this world!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye angrily scolded Hong Tianzhou: “In those years, Godkings and imperial lineages were nothing in your ancestors’ eyes. The banners of your clans symbolized a will made of steel and the most invincible corp that annihilated their enemies and crushed all cities in their way. But look at their descendants now. Even ants like Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village can walk all over you, subjecting you to servility! Have you no shame in letting down their supreme, hard-earned prestige?”</p>
 <p>Tianzhou felt his face and blood getting hotter. He recalled the glory days of his ancestors when Dongting Lake could look at the rest of the world with disdain. It was just as Li Qiye had said, his ancestors were invincible with nerves of steel.</p>
 <p>When they were alive, they proudly trod through the nine worlds and swept through all of their enemies. Hong Tianzhou was ignited. If they were to kneel before these great powers today, it would be a great letdown to their ancestors!</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhou threw caution to the wind and clenched his teeth before declaring: “Young Noble, if you are willing to help me, I am ready to lead our disciples to battle instead of negotiating for peace, even if the elders do not agree!”</p>
 <p>“It is good that you have this determination.” Li Qiye looked at him and nodded: “Return to Dongting Lake and observe how Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village, these ants, shall be trampled by your ancestors! Let the descendants of the lake remember their invincibility once more so that they will never dishonor their ancestors’ prestige again!”</p>
 <p>“We shall fight alongside you, Young Noble!” Hong Tianzhou’s blood was boiling in this moment as he clenched his fists.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei nodded his head approvingly after seeing this. He knew that Hong Tianzhou’s momentary burst of heroism had won Li Qiye’s favor. This will change the fate of the lake as well as his own.</p>
 <p>If he had faltered earlier and wanted to negotiate, Li Qiye would drop this matter right then and there. From then on, the lake would never rise again after falling into the hands of its enemies.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Both Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were furious at the murderer, Li Qiye. Shangguan Feiyan, who had suffered defeat to him, vowed to kill him as well.</p>
 <p>In just one night, these two powers mustered a one-hundred-thousand-strong army. They quickly mobilized to Dongting Lake and released a message about their intent to destroy it.</p>
 <p>This commotion excited this marine region. Many cultivators and sects eagerly awaited the show. Some sea demons were quietly gathering in the dark as well.</p>
 <p>Dongting Lake was coveted by many due to its rich nature. So now, when the lake was about to fall, everyone would want to share a cup of the soup.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for the sea demon sects close to Dongting Lake. They were secretly waiting for this battle to end. If the lake were to lose, then they would divide it. If the other two powers were to lose, then that would signal an eventually decline, meaning that there would be more promising territories up for grabs.</p>
 <p>“Dongting Lake, listen up. Hand over the human brat, Li Qiye, and put down your weapons in surrender. We may forgive you then. Otherwise, your lake shall be crushed!” The village master and king of Wyvern personally led this expedition.</p>
 <p>Before the grand army had even arrived, they already sent out this demand to the lake.</p>
 <p>With the siege looming over their heads, everyone in the lake became quite nervous. The ancestors here held a meeting throughout the entire night.</p>
 <p>The Xu, Lin, and Hong Clans were very unhappy with Hong Tianzhou for contributing to this trouble. It could even be said that they were furious. In their eyes, he was inviting a disaster to the lake.</p>
 <p>Originally, they wanted to form a marriage pact with Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. This development would be mutually beneficial since they could bolster their own status and authority. However, there were no longer any marriages, only enmity.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” On this day, this sea region was full of monstrous waves. Two great armies came from both sides of the lake in a pincer maneuver.</p>
 <p>On the left was Wyvern and on the right was the Bloodshark Village. This was a premeditated military deployment.</p>
 <p>Wyvern’s army consisted of many gigantic serpents soaring above the surface. This was a sea demon lineage that claimed to be descended from true dragons; the blood of true dragons flowed inside them.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was only them exaggerating their own worth. A more credible explanation was that their ancestor was a gigantic sea serpent. The dragon blood inside them was very thin. As for what type of dragon it was, this was still up for debate.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the disciples from Wyvern were born as sea serpents. After becoming powerful enough, they would finally gain a humanoid form. Having a humanoid form at birth meant that their bloodline was extremely noble. [1. Just a clarification on the name Wyvern. The raw word means “a dragon with horns not yet grown”, thus a lower-level dragon. I consider wyvern to be closely related to dragons, but at a lower level, so I chose Wyvern. The issue here is that the author is talking about the traditional Chinese dragon, which is more of a serpent, to describe these creatures. If I knew this beforehand, I probably wouldn’t have chosen Wyvern. Maybe Hydra or Drake (not the rapper) would have been a better fit, or Hornless Dragon Country to play it really safe.]</p>
 <p>Of course, the masters of this country were willing to maintain their true forms because it had a greater battle prowess. This, however, was very unfavorable for passing down their bloodline.</p>
 <p>At this time, a very long sea serpent resembling a gigantic dragon swam closer with a ferocious momentum. It looked like 100,000 dragons were dancing in the sky.</p>
 <p>At the same time, bloodsharks were cutting through the towering waves. Each of them was quite large, so surging tides were generated with each sweep of their tails.</p>
 <p>They had long and sharp white teeth. When they opened their jaws, these teeth looked just like swords; their cold glints instilled fear into the spectators.</p>
 <p>Old men were standing on some of them. These were all elders with soaring blood energies that made it seem as if they wanted to tear the world apart.</p>
 <p>“Dongting Lake, we give you one day to hand over Li Qiye and surrender or face the consequences!” Shangguan Feiyan finally showed herself in this great army with her divine halos.</p>
 <p>She fled the Jian Clan after suffering a complete defeat and was able to stay alive. This time, she came back with help.</p>
 <p>She didn’t only want revenge but also to take this opportunity to turn Dongting Lake into her own. She came prepared this time and had great confidence in herself. Even if Li Qiye and the lake were stronger than expected, they would still die!</p>
 <p>The encirclement around the lake left the crowd with varying emotions. Some were happy, some were shocked, and some had ulterior motives. Of course, there were some spectators that were watching purely for entertainment.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured while watching Dongting Lake under siege: “Shangguan Feiyan wants to wash away the humiliation from the Jian Clan. Li Qiye was really vicious then.”</p>
 <p>“He is indeed very ruthless, he even dared to kill the concubine of the Profound Monarch. It looks like he doesn’t give a damn about anything.” A sea demon sect master said: “But he might have difficulty escaping unscathed this time, even with Dongting Lake’s protection. I heard Shangguan Feiyan didn’t only come prepared, she also brought a weapon of a sea god. More importantly, I heard some rumors that she has been able to convince the Bloodshark Sovereign to come and personally destroy the lake.”</p>
 <p>“The Bloodshark Sovereign!” Both humans and sea demons were shivering after hearing this name.</p>
 <p>“Wow, a legendary sea god. When he comes out, who will be able to contend against him?” A newly debuted cultivator was full of awe.</p>
 <p></p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1269: Foreign Aggression And Internal Turmoil</b></p>
 <p>The Bloodshark Sovereign’s reputation spread far and wide. Many people were startled to hear this name. This was especially true for the youth who had just made their debut; they thought of the sovereign as an untouchable existence.</p>
 <p>“It really is a bit too much to call him a sea god, but he is powerful without a doubt.” A paragon who knew about what happened back then shook his head: “Yes, I can’t deny that he is strong, but he didn’t become a sea god back then. The Trident ultimately abandoned him.”</p>
 <p>“Even if he isn’t a sea god, if a real one doesn’t show up, who can stop him?” A youth said: “Once the sovereign is here, Dongting Lake will be destroyed and Li Qiye will die. This is fine, the humans will know the consequences of opposing sea demons in this region.”</p>
 <p>Some humans were quite annoyed at this rhetoric. Another couldn’t help but retort: “Generations are always changing. So what if the Bloodshark Sovereign is strong? Li Qiye is the strongest genius of the human race. He has sacrificed billions of Teeming Fish, defeated Feiyan with one hand and stomped Meiyu to death. He will be invincible in the younger generation!”</p>
 <p>The humans had been weak in this world for very long, but they had high hopes in Li Qiye, the rising star of the younger generation. If, say, a human could become an Immortal Emperor in this generation, then the human race would have a greater status. They could even suppress the sea demons in this world.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, don’t flatter him too much.” An unhappy young sea demon replied: “Everyone in the world knows that it was the Peacock Tree who performed the sacrifice, Li Qiye was only the errand boy. As for him hurting Miss Shangguan, it was only because he is a despicable wretch and ambushed her when she wasn’t paying attention. Otherwise, how could he hurt a God-Monarch like her?”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Then what about Gongsun Meiyu? He killed her with one stomp. Hmph, in my eyes, he will surely become the next Immortal Emperor.” The human cultivator didn’t back down: “Maybe you sea demons are afraid of him becoming an emperor and suppressing you all…”</p>
 <p>Before one knew it, small quarrels broke out among the youths before the battle had even started. The humans and sea demons were unrelenting. The young sea demons were certain of Wyvern and Bloodshark Village’s victory while the young humans had absolute confidence in Li Qiye killing Feiyan and crushing Wyvern.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the older generation was quiet, especially the ones with sects closest to Dongting Lake. Regardless of the victor, this war might spread to them as well.</p>
 <p>“Dongting Lake, huh.” A charming spirit imperial lineage heard this news. An ancestor smiled and gently shook his head: “It has been too long, the sea demons have probably forgotten how the lake was established. Back then, in the entire Dragon Demon Sea, they didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. But now, when the lake is in decline, those ants actually want a piece of the cake. Fine then, let them take the lead. I want to see if the lake is still as strong as before or not!”</p>
 <p>The 100,000 strong army surrounded the lake in a short period of time. Alarms rang everywhere across the lake. It didn’t matter if the disciples were willing to fight or not, they had to prepare for war.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu brought Hong Yujiao back to the lake overnight. Of course, Li Qiye was with them as well.</p>
 <p>The lake had entered a state of alert. All locations were heavily guarded with checkpoints scattered across the eighteen docks full of patrolling disciples.</p>
 <p>The eighteen docks were the largest foundations of the lake as well as their most fortified strongholds.</p>
 <p>The great clans all had their businesses in these docks. According to the iron laws of the lake, these docks and mountains belonged to the lake itself and couldn’t become private properties. For a long time, the clans obeyed these creeds and ruled the lake together.</p>
 <p>However, the ancestors later on abandoned the iron laws in order to gain more power. They divided the eighteen docks and the nearby mountains into their own properties.</p>
 <p>With that, the division of power became chaotic and messy. Changes of power were frequent, resulting in the lake being lost in chaos.</p>
 <p>From then on, the clans became even more disunified and followed their own whims. By only worrying about themselves, many past covenants and pacts with other powers could no longer be carried out.</p>
 <p>After Hong Tianzhu returned, he saw many disciples along the way. However, the disciples looked at them with strange stares. Some even avoided the group like a plague.</p>
 <p>After seeing this situation, Tianzhu felt quite negative and knew that something big had happened. He knew that the situation was not favorable.</p>
 <p>Even juniors like Hong Yujiao and Miss Lin could feel that something was amiss. They became quite nervous as well.</p>
 <p>Only Li Qiye was smiling without a care while leisurely walking through the lake.</p>
 <p>A disciple quickly told Miss Lin along the way: “Senior Sister Lin, Senior Uncle has called for you.”</p>
 <p>With that, Miss Lin stopped to look at Li Qiye and Hong Tianzhu.</p>
 <p>In fact, this didn’t only happen to her, several other disciples had the same happen to them.</p>
 <p>“Brother Xu, the ancestor wants you to come back right now…” Previously, many disciples didn’t know how to start this conversation, but after the Lin disciple took the initiative, they all came up and opened their mouths.</p>
 <p>The group consisted of many excellent disciples from the different clans. They came with Hong Tianzhu to the Jian Clan in order to befriend them.</p>
 <p>These disciples glanced at Hong Tianzhu at this time. They weren’t stupid and knew that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>In their minds, Hong Tianzhu was a good clan master. He was ambitious with great vision, so they were willing to follow him.</p>
 <p>“You all should go back.” Tianzhu gently sighed. He knew exactly what was going on, but he didn’t explicitly reveal it.</p>
 <p>These disciples were silent for a moment. Miss Lin bit her lips and secretly glanced over at Li Qiye. In the end, she gathered courage out of nowhere and said: “Junior Brother, you go back, I won’t be returning just yet.”</p>
 <p>Miss Lin and Hong Yujiao were good friends. They grew up as sisters, so their bond was quite deep. In this key moment, she chose to weather the storm together with Hong Yujiao.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’m willing to follow the sect master as well.” A different senior brother said: “Go back and tell that ancestor this: if the lake has made any decision, it should be publicly announced. Don’t treat us as pawns for those ancestors’ benefits.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, senior sisters aren’t objects, the ancestors can’t betroth them to whoever they want. One day, it might be us next.” A male disciple stated his displeasure as well.</p>
 <p>Some of the disciples felt cheated after finding out that the ancestors from several clans had privately decided the marriage of the two girls. They weren’t stupid. Today, it was these two, tomorrow, it could be them!</p>
 <p>Such arbitrary decisions had made them very unhappy. Moreover, Hong Tianzhu was vigorously opposing these marriages. This was something as clear as day to them.</p>
 <p>At the very least, their current master was willing to fight for their sake. But as for those ancestors, they treated marriages as a means for their own gains. It inevitably led to some aversion in the minds of these brilliant disciples.</p>
 <p>“Yes, we are willing to follow Clan Master through the turmoil. Everything should be transparent instead of being decided in secret meetings! We are not cattle!” All the other disciples were quite unhappy.</p>
 <p>After seeing the revolt, Li Qiye smiled and commented: “Not returning is fine.”</p>
 <p>The group’s eyes darted towards Li Qiye. Even though they hadn’t known him for too long, he gave them great confidence. His invincibility and decisiveness had conquered their hearts.</p>
 <p>“Yes, we have decided! The fate of Dongting Lake should be decided by everyone together, not a few ancestors!” One more disciple concurred.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu gently sighed after seeing this. He didn’t know whether to be happy or hapless. He was glad because at least the younger generation was opposing the old. What made him feel sad was that a disaster was befalling the lake, yet these ancestors were still vying for their own benefits.</p>
 <p>“Master!” A male disciple rushed over. He immediately whispered after seeing Hong Tianzhu: “Master, you need to run now. The ancestors have decided to depose you and want to keep you under house arrest. I heard them privately say that they want to hand you over to Wyvern as a token of apology!”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s expression sank. He understood why those disciples from before looked at him as if he was a plague.</p>
 <p>Being deposed was something he had expected, but being handed over to Wyvern never crossed his mind.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1270: Glory Of The Ancestors</b></p>
 <p>After hearing this, the disciples accompanying Hong Tianzhu were infuriated. This had completely exceeded their imaginations.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao indignantly asked: “The ancestors are going too far. Do our Hong ancestors share the same opinion?”</p>
 <p>The messenger nodded: “Our ancestors have passed this proposal as well after discussing things.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao angrily stated: “Do they have no shame? My father has toiled for the clan even if he didn’t perform any meritorious deeds. If a great power sends off their own sect master to another power as a token of apology, how will we ever show our face in Heaven Spirit again? This is an affront to the reputation of the human race! Not to mention that our enemy is Wyvern, even if it was a sea god’s lineage like the Roaring Conch, we still can’t do such a thing! This is the epitome of humiliation that will stop us from ever raising our heads again!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, why can’t we resist their oppression?!” These excellent disciples chimed in: “Our lake is not weaker than Wyvern, so we might as well go all out against them. As one of the three great human powers in Heaven Spirit, if we surrender even though we have the ability to fight, we’ll live a life subservient to the sea demons from this day onward…”</p>
 <p>One more disciple angrily exclaimed: “The ancestors are taking things too far this time. Even human vagabonds have more backbone than this. Why should we, a great power, kneel and lick our enemies’ boots?! At worst, we’ll fight to the death so that they can see our determination!”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu sighed and cast a glance at Li Qiye to ask: “Young Noble, what should we do now?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye said: “Go to the meeting chamber. Summon all the ancestors, protectors, elders, and supervisors of the lake.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, we’ll go to the chamber.” Hong Tianzhu firmly made his decision. For him right now, this was inevitable. There was no path of return, so he might as well risk it all for the lake’s final chance.</p>
 <p>The meeting chamber was used for deliberations and meetings for the lake. Many of their past decisions were negotiated and decided here.</p>
 <p>Later on as the competition for power intensified, the chamber was used less and less often. The ancestors rather negotiated privately and made decisions by themselves instead of deliberating publically.</p>
 <p>The chamber had a rustic feel, making it seem as if it was built next to Dongting Lake. One could see the entire lake while sitting in the lobby.</p>
 <p>A plaque was hung in the main lobby with the phrase, “seeing clearly the downy feather of autumn”. These simple words were majestic and all-deterrenting. [1. Idiom meaning sensitive to the finest detail, omniscient, able to distinguish right and wrong with acuity.]</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu came to the main lobby, but they were immediately stopped by the disciples there.</p>
 <p>“What, you want to rebel?” Hong Tianzhu’s expression darkened as he became quite oppressive. He was still the current sect master of the lake and had an important status in the minds of the disciples here.</p>
 <p>The guards hesitated for a moment before answering: “Sect Master, the ancestors’ decision…”</p>
 <p>“Their decision?” Tianzhu coldly uttered: “I have assumed the role of sect master and have been in charge of Dongting Lake until this very day. It is fine if the ancestors want to oust me, but tell them to come confront me in person. The elders and supervisors will transcribe everything. If I have violated the iron creeds of the lake, then I will surrender myself to the lake’s disposal. Otherwise, the ancestors need to give me an acceptable answer!”</p>
 <p>The disciples hesitated for half a day, not knowing the right words to say. On one side were the ancestors and the other, Hong Tianzhu.</p>
 <p>In the end, Hong Tianzhu became angry and shouted: “Go, ask your ancestors and the high ranking members to come. If everyone wants to judge me, I want them to do so in the main chamber in front of our forefathers!”</p>
 <p>A disciple quickly affirmed and went to report to the upper echelons. This matter was far beyond their jurisdiction.</p>
 <p>The group entered the grand chamber that could accommodate more than a thousand people.</p>
 <p>In the center of the chamber was a large chair. It struck an archaic chord to the spectators. What was even stranger was that there was a crow engraved in the back. The bird stood there in repose with resting eyes.</p>
 <p>There were many paintings along the wall. The people portrayed were magnificent. Some were adorned in armor with long swords in their hands. Others were scholars with their feathered fans, and more were riders trying to cross mountains and rivers…</p>
 <p>The paintings surrounded one particular banner with a silver fox embroidery. This fox looked incredibly realistic. Above it was the word, “Indomitable”.</p>
 <p>The young disciples looked all around since they rarely came here. Meanwhile, Tianzhu mirthlessly smiled. Outside of the ceremony when he was crowned as the sect master, there were too few conferences in this place since the ancestors would rather scheme with their own groups instead of caring about the overarching picture.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood before the big chair and glanced at the portraits. He saw the familiar faces once more, stirring some emotions and buried memories within him. Here were numerous generals that have grown old, countless soldiers that have been laid to rest.</p>
 <p>The banner itself created waves inside his heart. It once represented an unquestionable prestige and an indomitable legion.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, I didn’t expect my final verdict to be decided before the old forefathers.” Hong Tianzhu peered at the portraits and gave an ironic smile: “It is a bit amusing. Normally, no one comes here to worship and give tribute to the forefathers, but now, here we are.”</p>
 <p>The disciples didn’t answer. They understood that the sect master had no chance of reversing the situation after the verdict was made. Once the ancestors from the clans made up their minds, even the high elders wouldn't be able to do anything about it, let alone the lower tiers.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t offer his opinion. He simply looked at the banner and stared nonchalantly at the group: “Does any of you know what this banner represents?”</p>
 <p>The young ones exchanged glances. They knew very little about their older ancestors. Even though the banner was placed here, they didn’t know of its significance.</p>
 <p>Tianzhu hesitated for a bit before answering with uncertainty: “I heard our ancestors brought it back from a battlefield. We had a very powerful legion once.”</p>
 <p>Despite being the sect master, he still didn’t know too much about his older ancestors. In fact, ever since their clans decided to abandon the iron creeds and abolished the unions, they no longer brought up the forefathers. After all, they were the ones who chose to disobey the old laws.</p>
 <p>“More than just powerful.” Li Qiye looked at the banner and flatly said: “The Indomitable Battalion of the Silver Fox Legion was renowned for being cunning with many illustrious merits. They are definitely among the top of all the famous battalions in existence! This banner represents your ancestors’ supreme prestige. Under this symbol, they fought all over the nine worlds and fought crusades against true gods and other Immortal Emperors’ legions! Even the ominous grounds couldn’t repel their advance!”</p>
 <p>“They fought against imperial legions?” The youths became wide-eyed and were startled after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Yes, they fought against imperial legions.” Li Qiye nonchalantly continued: “In the distant years, one particular imperial legion considered themselves to be untouchable and provoked the supreme prestige since they thought they could fight against the Silver Fox Legion! Your ancestors personally volunteered to fight. After ten victories, they conquered the imperial city and forced the imperial cavalry to leave Heaven Spirit. In the end, even this Immortal Emperor personally admitted that the prestige of the Silver Fox was not to be provoked!”</p>
 <p>“In the nine worlds, who still knows about the Indomitable Battalion and their cunning? Winning victories despite being fewer in numbers, they’re experts at lightning speed ambushes!” Li Qiye ended with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Ten victories and conquering an imperial city…” Hong Yujiao was at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>In their minds, Immortal Emperors were invincible. Meanwhile, their legions were an extension of their peerless will. Wherever they went, they would sweep through in an unbeatable manner.</p>
 <p>But today, they found out that their old ancestors had once defeated an imperial legion!</p>
 <p>Just imagining the style and indomitable spirit of their ancestors roused them with heroism and pride. They could envision the scene of their ancestors riding their cavalries through the majestic lands! They never knew of this prestige and glory that belonged to their ancestors who once deterred the nine heavens and ten earths!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1271: Forced Abdication</b></p>
 <p>With the banner before him, Li Qiye spoke forlornly: “An imperial legion was nothing. They were mercilessly killed after provoking the supreme prestige!”</p>
 <p>Back in those years, the Zhang, Hong, Xu, and Lin ancestors decided to retire from the Indomitable Battalion, so he personally gave them this banner. Their descendants were allowed to hold onto this banner, the symbol of his will!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, after they passed away, their offspring declined one generation after another. This banner was never again raised in Heaven Spirit, it was just left in this corner as a rotting piece of tribute.</p>
 <p>The youths felt their blood churn while clenching their fists. They wondered when their lake would be able to relive their old might and glory.</p>
 <p>“What a shame, this banner can’t shake Heaven Spirit with its gallant dance on the battlefield anymore.” Li Qiye gently sighed.</p>
 <p>Hong Yujiao’s group became dejected as well after comparing the old prestige to the dysfunctional power grabbing situation in the present.</p>
 <p>“One day, our ancestors’ war banner will flutter again!” Hong Yujiao clenched her fist after making this claim.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t say anything. He slowly sat down on the big chair in the middle, situated higher than the rest of the chamber.</p>
 <p>For some odd reason, the others didn’t feel that this was out of place at all. It seemed as if the chair was created just for him. Him sitting there was a natural occurrence.</p>
 <p>“Squeak.” At this time, the door to the chamber was opened. Some elders walked in, followed by protectors and supervisors.</p>
 <p>After entering, this group darted their eyes at Hong Tianzhu and then Li Qiye, who was sitting in the main chair. They quickly exchanged glances.</p>
 <p>They went and sat down in their own seats. One elder looked at Tianzhu and spoke after a short contemplation: “Sect Master, why have you dragged an outsider to this place?”</p>
 <p>“Drag?” Tianzhu took a deep breath and coldly answered: “Even if Young Noble Li is an outsider, what about Yujiao and the others? How did the ancestors treat them? Their most important life decision was decided in secrecy. It is one thing to betroth them to humans, but why are we sending off our most excellent bloodlines to be used as incubators for the sea demons!”</p>
 <p>“Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village have always harbored malicious intentions towards us. They are hungry tigers and bloodthirsty sharks that prowl our lake. Sooner or later, they will try to divide us. Marrying our own blood to them is simply inviting wolves to our home!” Hong Tianzhu harshly scolded the elders and the others.</p>
 <p>For him, today was the day that he would break all pretenses with them. He abandoned caution and chose to go all out, even if the situation was unfavorable!</p>
 <p>“Everything in Dongting is decided by us old men. We have our own reasons.” A cold voice sounded at this time.</p>
 <p>Powerful auras came in one by one; gray-haired old men filed inside. Despite their old age, their eyes flashed with shudder-inducing glints.</p>
 <p>The lower-tiered members didn’t dare to say anything after these old men arrived since they were only juniors in the hierarchy. The old men were all ancestors of the lake from the great clans, aside from the Zhang who had left in the past.</p>
 <p>The ancestors here were at the paragon level. Their power was enough to suppress all the juniors here, so they had complete control of Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>Because of this, even if the juniors disagreed with them, there was nothing they could do to resist.</p>
 <p>The ancestors’ flashing gazes swept by the crowd. When they saw Li Qiye in the high chair, they scowled. One of them coldly said: “It is good that you are here!”</p>
 <p>They knew who Li Qiye was without a doubt.</p>
 <p>“Tianzhu, since you want a trial, we shall give you a trial!” A Xu Ancestor began: “You colluded with an outsider and indiscriminately killed the innocent, leading to creating powerful enemies for our lake and causing a great disaster for us all. On the basis of these crimes, we hereby remove you from your position as the sect master!”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu powerfully retorted against these accusations: “Ancestor, even if we assume that I am colluding with an outsider, at the very least, he is still a human! Ancestors, ask yourselves, are you not inviting wolves to our home? Against the wishes of your own disciples, you all chose to betroth them to the sea demons, our most excellent bloodlines at that! What kind of crime is this compared to mine?!”</p>
 <p>“Ancestors, it is better to be direct and frank from the start, so I’ll speak.” Hong Tianzhu sneered: “The disciples of the lake aren’t properties of the clans. They are the resources of our lake. Each of them belongs to the lake, not any individual clan! They follow the laws of the lake and not the will of any ancestor who wants to influence the fate of the lake!”</p>
 <p>“I am not the one violating the iron creeds of our lake, it is all of you ancestors!” He continued on: “So the first to be removed from your positions should be you, not me.”</p>
 <p>“If the lake wants to oust me, fine, I have no problems with this. As long as everyone follows our creeds, remove the ancestors first, then remove me as well!” Tianzhu had decisively and completely sided against the ancestors since he had made up his mind prior to this.</p>
 <p>An ancestor shouted: “How impudent, you unfilial brat!”</p>
 <p>“Tianzhu, you have crossed the line.” Even an ancestor of the Hong Clan deepened his tone: “Marrying Yujiao to Wyvern is for the sake of an alliance. Is there a better union than this? It will give us another ally.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu responded with a deep breath: “Ancestor, you are my senior, so I should respect you. However, what you have done in this matter leaves the hearts of myself and that of our disciples cold! Don’t be bringing up the lake with such cliche excuses. If you want to berate me, then take out the agreements that you have with Wyvern and Shangguan Feiyan. Show it to all of us disciples.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu gazed at his own clan’s ancestor and said: “Ancestor, don’t think that I don’t know about your selfish motives for these unions! Don’t tell me that you ancestors didn’t ask for longevity pills from the Roaring Conch with Feiyan as the middleman.”</p>
 <p>“This so-called union for allies is only a guise for your own sake, for the pills from the Roaring Conch! In order to live longer, you don’t give a damn about the lives of your disciples! They are only objects to trade, mere cattle in your eyes!”</p>
 <p>The Hong ancestor’s embarrassment turned into fury as he cried out: “Enough, Tianzhu, this is not only disrespectful, you are also betraying your ancestors! It is a capital offense!”</p>
 <p>“I agree that I am being disrespectful, but as for betrayal? I, Hong Tianzhu, can use my true fate to swear that if I am betraying my ancestors, lightning shall condemn me to eternal damnation!” Tianzhu angrily shouted back: “There, now, dear ancestors, do you all dare to pat your chests proudly and swear that you haven’t betrayed your ancestors? Who are the ones who have abandoned our laws and creeds?! Who betrayed the ancestral teachings?! I was not the one to do so, take a moment to reflect on who the real traitors are!”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s rage was at its limit. He had thoroughly lost all vestiges of faith in these ancestors after he found out that they wanted to hand him over to Wyvern. They were only working for their own benefits with wanton regard for the lives of their disciples!</p>
 <p>Several ancestors were tongue-tied and unwilling to face this topic. Meanwhile, the elders, protectors, and supervisors didn’t dare to interject.</p>
 <p>“Tianzhu, as long as you recognize your mistakes and apologize to us and ask for forgiveness from Wyvern and Bloodshark Village, I’m certain they will forgive your misdeeds.” An even older ancestor from the Hong Clan with a higher position spoke austerely.</p>
 <p>“Ask for forgiveness?” Tianzhu snorted: “Ancestors, I’m already standing here today, there is no chance I would beg the enemies for mercy! I can accept being tried and admit my mistakes and incompetence to the old forefathers, but don’t even think about making me apologize to the enemies!”</p>
 <p>“I was born in Dongting Lake and I shall die a ghost in Dongting Lake. Behead me if I was wrong, I shall die without uttering a single complaint! But if you ancestors must act so servile towards those two powers, then go ahead, take my head and hand it to them!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1272: Drawn Swords and Bent Bows</b></p>
 <p>His speech silenced the entire chamber. None of the members here wanted to talk.</p>
 <p>As for the ancestors themselves, they didn’t think Tianzhu would suddenly act so tough and openly revolt against them by challenging their authority.</p>
 <p>“You traitorous disciple, daring to bluster like this!” A Lin Ancestor shouted: “Go, tie this traitor up and punish him.”</p>
 <p>No one moved after this command came out. All the elders, protectors, and supervisors remained still.</p>
 <p>“First Elder, what are you waiting for, go capture this traitor.” The ancestor raised his voice.</p>
 <p>Among the section for elders, one elder looked at the Lin Ancestor and Tianzhu before answering with apprehension: “Ancestor… about this…”</p>
 <p>In fact, no one wanted to take action in this matter. Capturing Hong Tianzhu was one thing, but handing his head over to Wyvern was something no one wanted to do.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that cutting off the head of their sect master and giving it to their enemies was an act that would cause their lake to never be able to lift its head again, none of the members here wanted to bear this infamy.</p>
 <p>Whoever cut off Tianzhu’s head would be recorded in the annals of history. Strictly speaking, Tianzhu didn’t quite violate any laws from the lake. Under such circumstances, the one who decapitates him would be remembered and reviled by the future generations for an eternity.</p>
 <p>Thus, who would be willing to carry out the order of these ancestors? The members here weren’t fools. The ancestors were willing to kill Tianzhu for their own gains — this meant that no matter who became the next sect master, their head could fall if they went against the interests of the ancestors in the future as well.</p>
 <p>These ancestors were in control at this moment, so they used the lake’s resources as their own. The members needed someone who could contain the ancestors so that they wouldn’t be able to do as they please, so that they can’t sacrifice the lake for personal gain.</p>
 <p>Tianzhu’s upheaval was a good beginning. If he could accomplish his goals today, then the juniors from the lake could stop the ancestors from their dictatorial nature later on.</p>
 <p>However, if Tianzhu were to be killed today, the lake would completely belong to the ancestors and they would become mere pawns. The regulations and laws of the lake wouldn't be able to stop these ancestors any longer.</p>
 <p>“All of you want to rebel as well?” The Lin Ancestor shouted after seeing the First Elder staying still.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye commented out of nowhere at this time: “At least Dongting Lake can still be saved with some people who can see the big picture. They understand that the lake doesn’t belong to you.”</p>
 <p>The Lin Ancestor furiously shouted: “Shut up, junior, we’ll deal with you in a second—”</p>
 <p>In a flash, Li Qiye disappeared. Before the ancestor could finish his words, he was sent flying from Li Qiye’s punch while spurting blood. He didn’t even have the chance to stand before Li Qiye had him by the neck.</p>
 <p>“Junior, don’t be crazy!” A different ancestor from the Lin Clan instantly stood up and screamed, but he didn’t dare to do anything while his peer was in Li Qiye’s grasp.</p>
 <p>The ancestor in his clasp cried out: “Junior, if you, you even dare to hurt half a hair of mine, don’t even think about leaving the lake alive.”</p>
 <p>“I could have spared your life out of consideration for your ancestors. Unfortunately, you are too stupid.” Li Qiye glared at this ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” He easily crushed his neck then threw the corpse to the side like trash.</p>
 <p>All this happened incredibly quickly. The other ancestors could only watch the death of their fellow ancestor.</p>
 <p>When their minds returned, Li Qiye was already back in the high chair. In an instant, all the ancestors from the clans surrounded him.</p>
 <p>A Hong ancestor sternly stated: “Junior, you think you can do whatever you want just because we want to capture you alive?”</p>
 <p>A Xu ancestor exclaimed: “Capture and hand him over to Miss Shangguan!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glared at these ancestors and spoke with contempt: “Just a bunch of Virtuous Paragons, yet you dare to bluster in front of me? Are you all too stupid to gather information? Shangguan Feiyan is a God-Monarch, yet I took her down with one fist. What can any of you do?”</p>
 <p>The ancestors shuddered after hearing this. They exchanged glances and immediately took out their best weapons. The group was still eager to try with an imposing momentum.</p>
 <p>A Lin ancestor retorted: “Junior, even if you are powerful, don’t forget that this is Dongting Lake. Since you’re here, don’t even think about leaving.”</p>
 <p>They weren’t willing to back down at this moment since their lake still had an ace up its sleeve. Their great formation was still dormant; once they activated it, they would be able to trap a powerful God-Monarch like Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly declared: “If you had half this courage when facing the enemies outside, your Dongting Lake wouldn’t have been reduced to this pathetic state of bending over and scraping for favors. Only a bunch of idiots who can only bully their own nest. Very well, I will massacre all of you today and eradicate your ancestors’ unfilial descendants in their stead.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s heart skipped a beat after hearing this. He quickly interjected: “Young Noble Li, please show mercy.”</p>
 <p>Even though he was going against the ancestors, he never thought about killing all of them. After all, they were still his seniors. It would be a huge sin if he was part of the reason why they were all killed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye dismissively countered: “They’re just a group of fools, leaving them behind will only cause more trouble for the lake.” His eyes revealed a murderous glint.</p>
 <p>The ancestors’ hearts jumped after seeing the terrifying murderous glint in Li Qiye’s eyes. They received a wake-up call of just who they were dealing with and immediately cried: “We beseech the Virtuous Ancestors.”</p>
 <p>“Such arrogant words!” A heartless voice emerged. It had a hint of stateliness that prevented others from resisting.</p>
 <p>At this time, four old men were carried inside. They were sitting on big chairs with tiger fur linings. They were extremely hoary and gave off the feeling of death. Their eyes were half closed; it was as if the moment they closed them completely, they would bid farewell to this world.</p>
 <p>Moreover, their blood energies were essentially non-existent. Nevertheless, their half-closed eyes still emitted flashes as sharp as swords capable of tearing through all things.</p>
 <p>“Virtuous Ancestors!” Hong Tianzhu was completely shocked after seeing the four ancestors and had to take a step back to calm himself. The other members were astonished as well and bowed their heads.</p>
 <p>These four were the strongest ancestors that currently presided over Dongting Lake and had been living reclusively. They were also the ones behind the old reformation that abandoned the old creeds and unions. In the end, they forced the Zhang Clan away and divided all the properties of the lake.</p>
 <p>Even though they rarely showed themselves, the direction of the lake was entirely under their control. All of the ancestors here were either their disciples or direct descendants. It could even be said that in order to prolong their lives, they kept a vast amount of resources from the lake for themselves.</p>
 <p>The ancestors made way for the four old men. They quickly formed a formation to surround Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>At this moment, no one dared to say anything. The elders and protectors dared to challenge the other ancestors, but they lost their courage in front of these four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
 <p>Some of the elders who were privy to past information were even more fearful of these four ancestors. They were aware of the four’s cruelty. Any disobedience would result in either banishment or house arrest. Nothing good would come from opposing them.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s face paled; he secretly winked at Li Qiye to let him know how bad the situation had become.</p>
 <p>“First, capture that traitor Tianzhu.” The four ancestors didn’t bother glancing at Tianzhu. They had absolute power and controlled the life and death of the lake’s disciples.</p>
 <p>A younger ancestor immediately came closer to capture him. At this time, Hong Tianzhu could only stand there with an austere demeanor. He knew that resistance would be futile due to his lack of strength.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1273: Spirits Of The Ancestors</b></p>
 <p>An ancestor shouted at Hong Tianzhu: “Traitor, surrender now!”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu instinctively stumbled back and shouted as well: “Young Noble Li, go!” He became desperate the moment the four Virtuous Ancestors showed up. There were no chips he could use to bargain against them.</p>
 <p>“Get down!” Li Qiye’s eyes focused as he chanted an oppressive mantra.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The ancestor that wanted to capture Tianzhu lost control of his body. He was struck by Li Qiye’s spell and was forced several steps back.</p>
 <p>The four Virtuous Ancestors turned serious after seeing the mantra Li Qiye chanted. They immediately opened their eyes completely. The sharpness of their vision painfully scraped others’ skin.</p>
 <p>“Junior, you are indeed strong.” One of them coldly uttered: “But you are wrong about one thing. Our Dongting Lake might be willing to negotiate for peace with others, but this does not mean we are weak!”</p>
 <p>“I understand.” Li Qiye chuckled: “You want to use Wyvern to suck up to the Roaring Conch like a dog in order to obtain longevity pills from them. This is throwing away all the face of your ancestors, no, you descendants are spitting on your ancestors’ faces.”</p>
 <p>“Little animal, you can keep running your mouth.” A different ancestor sneered: “We’ll sever your limbs and muscles before handing you over to Miss Shangguan.”</p>
 <p>With that, all four took out their weapons. Their expressions became quite solemn and ruthless afterward.</p>
 <p>These four weapons were quite old; their spots and scars spoke volumes of the many battles they had seen. The ancestor’s battle intents surged with the appearance of the weapons, like a battle horn riling up the mighty cavalry.</p>
 <p>In a short amount of time, a ferocious bloodthirst filled the entire chamber like a true dragon entering the sea, a thirsty tiger leaving the mountain or a direwolf leaving its cage. The four weapons’ will to kill was unstoppable. They could destroy everything standing in their way!</p>
 <p>“The forefathers’ weapons.” The members here were dazed at the sight of these ancient weapons and retreated. There was a sense of reverence in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Junior, accept your defeat.” The four ancestors revealed menacing smiles. They shouted at the same time and attacked with their weapons. It was the start of a great formation!</p>
 <p>They had confidence that the moment this formation was formed, they could even stop a Godking, let alone a young junior.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” However, before the four weapons could suppress Li Qiye, he slammed both hands down on his chair and an order writ came flying towards the banner on the wall. The fox on it seemed to be coming back to life.</p>
 <p>In this split second, the four weapons continued to fly towards Li Qiye, but not to attack him. They jumped to him as if they had just seen a family member.</p>
 <p>An incredible thing happened. The weapons floated above his head in a very happy manner, like singing skylarks.</p>
 <p>The four ancestors were aghast before this scene. These weapons had always been in their possession. After abandoning the iron creeds, they had gained full control of the weapons until today.</p>
 <p>“Return!” The four recalled the weapons in unison. However, there was no reaction. The weapons continued to float above Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Start!” The four didn’t give up and didn’t mind using their own longevity blood to amplify their summons. Alas, it was still useless.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” This spectacle left everyone speechless. Their lake’s weapons were being controlled by an outsider. However, how could they possibly know that these weapons were personally created by Li Qiye who then handed them down to the forefathers of the Hong, Zhang, Xu and Lin Clans? Who in this world could understand these weapons more than their own creator?</p>
 <p>“The four weapons of the Indomitable Battalion belong to everyone, they’re not the personal properties of you fools.” Li Qiye coldly uttered: “Your foolishness has ruined your ancestors’ prestige and glory. Today, on their behalf, I sentence you to death!”</p>
 <p>While issuing large explosions, the four weapons immediately attacked the four Virtuous Ancestors; all of them were aghast. They took out their own strongest weapons in order to resist the assault.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Another loud blast resounded. The four ancestors were forced to take several steps back. They were indeed powerful and stopped one attack from these ancient weapons.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shouted: “Where are my generals of the Indomitable Battalion?!” At this time, the crow on the back of the seat suddenly came back to life. It spread its wings and covered Li Qiye completely while flying above him.</p>
 <p>This was initially a carved image of a crow, but it suddenly came back to life. It poured down one holy, untouchable law after another.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The part of the lake that faced the chamber had bubbles and waves everywhere. Four sturdy figures emerged from the lake.</p>
 <p>These four came into the chamber. They were made from the lake water, so they were sparkling and translucent.</p>
 <p>The crowd became astonished the moment they saw the faces of these figures made from water. One person glanced at the portraits along the wall and screamed: “Ancestors!”</p>
 <p>Though there were many portraits on the walls, the paintings of these four were bigger than the others. Without a doubt, their status was much higher as well.</p>
 <p>At this time, the members here found four particular portraits that matched these figures. They were the first forefathers of the Lin, Zhang, Xu, and Hong Clans!</p>
 <p>“Our ancestors’ spirits!” Hong Tianzhu shouted while recalling what Li Qiye had said before. He quickly prostrated on the ground, bowing his head.</p>
 <p>This scene was too shocking. Their oldest forefathers suddenly appeared in spiritual form. All the ancestors and lower-ranking members were scared out of their minds. They never thought that such a day would come.</p>
 <p>“Ancestors…” After seeing Tianzhu kneeling on the ground, the other elders and protectors quickly followed suit.</p>
 <p>“Unfilial bastards!” The four men made of water released a shout that shook the mountains and rivers. They were existences that had once swept through the world. All the ancestors here shivered in the face of the pressure they let off.</p>
 <p>The four Virtuous Ancestors turned pale and turned to flee. They had abandoned the iron creeds and the union — this was a clear violation of the ancestral teachings. They had a guilty conscience, so the appearance of these spirits made their souls fly away and scatter from fear. All they wanted to do was to get the hell out of this place.</p>
 <p>However, these water figures wouldn’t let them escape so easily. They casually reached out and the four weapons fell into their hands. This heralded the coming of four godly generals.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The weapons mercilessly suppressed this entire area and set off a monstrous battle aura.</p>
 <p>“No…” The four Virtuous Ancestors had already lost their will to fight and couldn’t react in time. All four were swiftly suppressed by these weapons.</p>
 <p>The water figures threw these suppressed ancestors down before Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stared and coldly uttered at the four Virtuous Ancestors on the ground: “The Dongting Lake of today and the Indomitable Battalion of past, what is the judgment in accordance to the iron creeds?”</p>
 <p>The four water figures mercilessly replied: “Death!” At the same time, all the portals on the walls lit up. Every single one of them exuded an invincible battle aura. Ruthless laws emerged from these paintings, the symbols of their honest and incorruptible creeds within a martial order.</p>
 <p>“Kneel!” Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold. The crow above his head exuded a supreme divine aura. It seemed like an eternal existence was coming back to life. This crow proceeded to glare at everyone present. At this time, Li Qiye’s words represented an untouchable will.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The four water figures kicked the ancestors, forcing them to kneel on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Kneel!” Li Qiye shifted his attention towards the other ancestors from the great clans. At this time, all the elders and protectors were already prostrating while these ancestors were trembling with fear.</p>
 <p>After seeing his cold glare and the iron creeds within the portraits, they didn’t dare to resist and immediately kneeled on the ground.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye declared: “Abandoning the iron creeds, shattering the union, violating the ancestral teachings, what should the punishment be?”</p>
 <p>“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic reverberations came about. The iron creeds within the portraits intertwined to form a tiger tally with the word “death” on top of it. [1. The two-piece tiger tallies (hu-fu, 虎符 in Chinese) were used by kings or emperors to command and dispatch their army. The right piece was retained in the central government while the left piece was issued to the local officials or commanders. If someone wanted to dispatch the troops from a certain area, he had to show the right piece of the tiger tally in order to gain authorization; both pieces of the tally had to match each other. I thought a fox tally would be more fitting in terms of the context, but a tiger is the historical symbol.]</p>
 <p>The word was full of blood and instilled fear into all the spectators.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1274: Suppression</b></p>
 <p>Everyone present trembled before the iron creeds. At this time, they understood the real meaning behind the creed. This was a real entity meant for rewards and punishments, it wasn’t just a concept.</p>
 <p>“Kill.” Li Qiye mercilessly declared the fate of the four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
 <p>Four water swords protruded from the water figures’ hands. They raised these swords and cut down at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” The Virtuous Ancestors’ heads fell to the ground. Blood rushed out from their necks and dyed the chamber red.</p>
 <p>All the ancestors here trembled when they saw the rolling heads. Their arrogance from earlier disappeared right away. Even their Virtuous Ancestors were killed, and they were not much in comparison.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat back in his high chair and coldly swept through everyone with his piercing eyes. Everyone was now kneeling while feeling a fearful chill, Hong Tianzhu included.</p>
 <p>They finally understood what a supreme authority was. This was the true suppression of the nine heavens. The moment the Dark Crow spread its wings, the entire world would be blotted out. Billions of existences would begin to tremble.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye questioned them: “Before your forefathers and the iron creeds, do you confess your sins or do their spirits have to force you?”</p>
 <p>The four water figures came forth emotionlessly. Even before their descendants, they were as cold and ruthless as ever. Each took over a corner with their sword raised. Even though these blades were made out of water, they were still flashing with bloodthirst. These were god-slaying weapons.</p>
 <p>The ancestors here were aghast when the spirits of their ancestors blocked the four directions. They understood that if they tried to escape, these spirits would show no mercy in striking them down.</p>
 <p>“I, I confess my sins.” A Hong ancestor realized that the situation was no longer salvageable. Struggling any further would be futile and suicidal, so he dropped flat to the ground and said: “I am guilty and willing to accept the punishment of the iron creed.”</p>
 <p>“I, I confess as well.” With someone taking the lead, the rest of the ancestors eventually bowed on the ground, no longer daring to resist. People all valued their lives. In their eyes, a clean and honorable death was no match for a borrowed life.</p>
 <p>“Very well, the capital punishment can be forgiven, but judgment must be delivered.” Li Qiye coldly uttered: “In accordance to the iron creeds, they shall be punished for their gravest sin. Their sentence shall be banishment to the detention precipice. Their lives shall be spared so that they can serve the lake in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Clank, clank, clank!” Iron laws flew out from the portraits and instantly nailed themselves into the bodies of these ancestors. They then dragged these ancestors away without meeting any resistance.</p>
 <p>The iron creeds were the vows of their forefathers and all the brothers in the Indomitable Battalion. These laws contained their unbendable will and heroism. To resist these iron laws was tantamount to resisting the entire battalion.</p>
 <p>In the past, these newer ancestors chose to abandon the creeds. Not only did they stop passing down its teachings, they made decisions in secret instead of debating using this chamber. In the end, they didn’t have the ability to destroy the creeds themselves.</p>
 <p>The lower-tier members were continuously shivering while watching their ancestors being dragged away. Even Hong Tianzhu was startled.</p>
 <p>They had heard about the iron creeds in the past despite their ancestors’ unwillingness to talk about this subject. However, they thought that the creeds were only a written set of rules like the ancestral teachings. They didn’t expect it to have such power.</p>
 <p>They finally realized why the Virtuous Ancestors chose to abandon the creeds and stopped debating in this grand chamber. So it turned out that these four were afraid of the creeds.</p>
 <p>It all became clear now. If everything was carried out in accordance with the creeds, the clans could only carry out their own responsibilities without taking advantage of the lake. There was no way of imposing their will on the laws and direction of the lake.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly declared: “I don’t care how many resources and docks your clans have occupied. From today on, the iron creeds are in effect again. I will give you one year to complete this process. The violators shall be at the mercy of the creeds.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu was the first to agree to the re-implementation of their old legacy. He prostrated on the ground and quickly declared: “I shall obey the iron creeds.”</p>
 <p>“We also agree.” The others quickly did the same and stated their willingness. In their eyes, even the ancestors were powerless to stop this, let alone them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly said: “Very well, I am here today to represent your forefathers in order to clean up this mess, but ultimately, the authority of the lake still belongs to all of you. The fate of the lake is within your grasp.”</p>
 <p>The crow floating above him returned to the chair while the portraits on the wall turned still once more after the iron creeds slowly went back inside them. The four water figures also returned to the lake.</p>
 <p>“We respectfully bid farewell to the ancestors.” Hong Tianzhu thought about a legend after seeing the features of these figures that were completely identical to the portraits on the wall. He bowed his head once more to the spirits.</p>
 <p>“Farewell, Venerable Ancestors.” The others did the same. They understood that the spirits of their ancestors had always been within the lake.</p>
 <p>“I come bearing news!” After the four water figures left, a disciple hastily rushed in. When he saw the scene within the chamber, he was at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>While still in his chair, Li Qiye spoke in an aloof manner: “What’s the matter, speak.”</p>
 <p>A stranger sitting in the main seat of the chamber was a very strange event. However, this disciple uncontrollably answered: “Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village have declared war. They demand an answer within forty-five minutes or else they’ll begin the siege.” [1. The raw is three-quarters of an hour.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sneered: “Naive fools. Very well, today, everyone in the Dragon Demon Sea shall open their eyes to witness the true might of Dongting Lake!”</p>
 <p>“With the exception of the elders and protectors who need to maintain their posts, everyone else follow me. It is time for all of you to see the invincible prestige of your ancestors, their style as they swept through the nine worlds. Be ready to engrave it in your minds.” With that, he stood up and went outside.</p>
 <p>Outside of those who had to return to their posts, the rest followed Li Qiye outside. The great armies of Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were surrounding the lake. They had made preparations to attack with both the village master and the King of Wyvern boosting their morale. They awaited the order to attack.</p>
 <p>The disciples from the lake guarding the checkpoints were quite nervous. They didn’t know whether the lake could withstand this looming disaster. Many great powers and cultivators from all over the seas eagerly watched. Some just wanted to have some fun while others aimed to take advantage of the situation.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feiyan rose to the sky and declared: “Forty-five minutes have passed. Elders, if you don’t give us a reply, don’t blame us for attacking your lake.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you a response right now.” A dismissive voice came about. Someone was floating above the lake’s sky with Hong Tianzhu’s group right behind them.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye!” Shangguan Feiyan immediately became aggressive. Her eyes turned red upon seeing her enemy again!</p>
 <p>“It’s Li Qiye.” The others watching from the horizon were surprised to see Hong Tianzhu together with Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Feiyan angrily blurted: “Li, you actually dared to linger here?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled in response: “Why not? You think you are a threat to me? You’re just a loser who lost to me before.”</p>
 <p>“You!” Feiyan had no retort to this nonchalant statement. Meanwhile, the others exchanged glances. Even though some thought that she lost due to her own carelessness, this was an irrefutable truth.</p>
 <p>She took a deep breath and said: “Li, someone else will take care of you. I am talking to the lake right now.”</p>
 <p>With that, she shifted her gaze towards Hong Tianzhu and coldly said: “Hong Tianzhu, where are your ancestors? They have agreed to hand Li Qiye over, this is the condition for surrender.”</p>
 <p>So it turned out that the ancestors from the lake had already finished negotiating with Feiyan on the conditions of surrender the moment she gathered her troops here.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1275: Bloodshark Sovereign</b></p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu was unperturbed while standing behind Li Qiye. He flatly replied: “Miss Shangguan, Young Noble Li is our lake’s plenipotentiary. If you wish to talk, you can talk with him.”</p>
 <p>“A plenipotentiary?” Not only were the spectators surprised, even the guarding disciples of the lake were caught off guard.</p>
 <p>Such a large lineage like the lake actually gave complete authority to someone this suddenly. Moreover, it was under duress. How could people not be shocked by this development?</p>
 <p>The disciples from the lake didn’t even know who Li Qiye was, let alone understand him.</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s expression changed after hearing this as well. She didn’t expect this reversal.</p>
 <p>She coldly uttered: “Tianzhu, you should think twice. This is an existential crisis for your Dongting Lake!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled in response before Tianzhu could answer: “There’s no need to waste time. Didn’t you want to talk? Go ahead, I am a very open-minded person. Say what you want.”</p>
 <p>Judging from the lack of response from Tianzhu and the other elders, Feiyan knew that the lake was on Li Qiye’s side.</p>
 <p>In spite of this, she still thought that she had a strong card up her sleeve, so she was full of confidence: “Li Qiye, if you want to save the lake, first kneel and confess your sins, I will be the judge. Second, the lake must hand over fifty female disciples with excellent bloodlines to become our incubators. Third, Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village will station troops at the lake. Only when these three conditions are satisfied will we withdraw our troops.”</p>
 <p>A disciple blurted out: “Bullshit!” No one with a sliver of pride would ever accept such conditions.</p>
 <p>This was a great humiliation to their lake. If they were to agree to these demands, they would never be able to lift their heads up again. This was an indelible shame.</p>
 <p>The cultivators nearby secretly shook their heads. These conditions were too outrageous. No lineage would agree to them.</p>
 <p>“And if we refuse?” Li Qiye didn’t become angry. Instead, he gently smiled.</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s eyes turned serious, just like her tone: “If you refuse, well, it won’t be up to you. We’ll capture you and flay your skin before ripping out your tendons! As for the lake, we will trample it, kill all the men and enslave the women!”</p>
 <p>This remark definitely didn’t win over the disciples from the lake. They became even more furious.</p>
 <p>A disciple angrily shouted: “We’ll fight to the end!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Fight to the end!” Many echoed the sentiment with blaring roars towards Feiyan.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye remained calm and faintly smiled: “Do you want to hear my opinion? It is very simple, you will be the one to kneel and present your head as an apology. Second, all the disciples from Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village must surrender to my whim. If you can agree to this, then I will only kill your ancestors and elders while sparing the others. If not, then it will be even simpler. I shall massacre Wyvern and the village and trample through your ancestral grounds, turning everything to ashes. Your lineages shall be no more in the Dragon Demon Sea from tomorrow onward.”</p>
 <p>Such outrageous words shocked everyone present. One person among the spectators commented: “That’s an incredible response.”</p>
 <p>Gongsun Meiyu's death had shown everyone that Li Qiye was strong, but it was a bit ridiculous to declare the destruction of two great powers.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, give the order, let us kill this little animal!” The disciples from wyvern were enraged and primed to fight.</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s expression was as cold as ice as she replied: “You’ll defeat us with just your empty words?”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Li Qiye dismissively said: “A loser like you isn’t qualified to negotiate with me.”</p>
 <p>This repetitive retort left her face red. It was too great of a blow to her; the only way she could erase this disgrace was to kill him.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, such blustering. I have traveled across the four seas, yet I still haven’t heard of someone declare that they would destroy my Bloodshark Village.” While Feiyan had yet to respond, a gloomy voice came about instead.</p>
 <p>In this great army of one hundred thousand soldiers, an old man was being carried out. He was seated on a great throne and had an imperious temperament.</p>
 <p>People finally noticed his great stature when he slowly stood up. They felt much smaller after seeing his full size.</p>
 <p>However, his physical prowess was not the only reason why others felt insignificant before him. He exuded a divine aura that made him seem as if he was untouchable, like a god overlooking all creation.</p>
 <p>An old paragon recognized his identity and shouted: “Bloodshark Sovereign!”</p>
 <p>“Bloodshark Sovereign!” Even the younger ones who had never seen him before had heard of his fame. They became quite frightened due to his notoriety.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu’s group took a step back in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“He is a heaven-defying expert that had the chance to become a sea god back then.” Older paragons stared at him in awe.</p>
 <p>This was a preeminent character during the last generation, someoneaccepted by the Trident. His fame was at an all-time high during that period because everyone in Heaven Spirit assumed that he would be the next sea god.</p>
 <p>However, for some reason, the Trident left him later on and accepted a different sea demon as its master. That sea demon later became the Lithodidae Sea God!</p>
 <p>Despite being abandoned, the sovereign still reached the top to become one of the most powerful demons of his time.</p>
 <p>Today, his personal arrival left everyone gasping. They understood now that Wyvern and the village had no intentions of peacefully resolving the issue with the lake. Its destruction was their primary goal.</p>
 <p>Some sea demons became quite excited and muttered: “I’m afraid the lake will become ashes the moment the sovereign takes action.”</p>
 <p>“Feiyan is quite influential, to actually be able to tempt even the sovereign.” Some now realized why Feiyan was this confident. With a hidden card like the sovereign, victory was certain.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere turned tense to the extreme. The lake’s disciples went pale after seeing the famous sovereign. Despair reared its ugly head in their hearts since their lake was facing probable destruction.</p>
 <p>Outside of the battlefield on the distant horizon, many powerful charming spirit ancestors watched everything play out. In this region, charming spirits didn’t want to mingle with sea demons, especially those at the ancestor level.</p>
 <p>This ancestor from an ancient lineage with astral eyes murmured: “That devil Bloodshark wants to take action, I wonder if the lake’s real power is still there or not.”</p>
 <p>A disciple next to him curiously asked: “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>In the eyes of many youths and even the previous generation cultivators, Dongting Lake could be considered a great power, but it couldn’t compare to actual first-rate sects.</p>
 <p>“It is an ancient legend that I have only heard of.” The ancestor explained: “The tales speak of the lake’s incredible ancestors that once contributed to an invincible legion. Our own ancestors have said that their ancestors left behind an incomparable protection for their descendants.”</p>
 <p>This was the first time this junior had heard of this legend, so he skeptically replied: “Really?”</p>
 <p>“Most likely.” The ancestor continued: “The lake is a coveted treasure ground. If they didn’t have this protection, others would have destroyed it already, there wouldn’t be any need to wait till today.”</p>
 <p>Back on the battlefield, the atmosphere was quite solemn. The disciples from the lake all felt a cold chill and thought that they wouldn’t be able to escape this disaster.</p>
 <p>“Haha, it seems like disappearing for a single generation has made the youths much more arrogant.” The sovereign coldly stared at Li Qiye: “You must be tired of living to bluster about destroying my village when I am still around.”</p>
 <p>No one found his words unreasonable due to his established prestige.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1276: Indomitable Battalion</b></p>
 <p>The fearful crowd didn’t dare to oppose the burly Bloodshark Sovereign. Even though he failed to become a sea god, he was still frightening all the same.</p>
 <p>“Just a fake god, yet you still dare to spout your nonsense here?” Li Qiye nonchalantly cast a glance at the sovereign: “Not to mention a pretender like you, even if a true god came, I would still nail him to death.”</p>
 <p>Everyone was stunned after hearing this. God-slaying was what came out of Li Qiye’s mouth. Perhaps in the entire world, no one would be able to do this, let alone someone from the younger generation.</p>
 <p>The Bloodshark Sovereign’s expression soured. As a very powerful sea demon, the world had always been respectful to him even before he came out. But now, when his true body was here, a junior showing such public disdain left him without any face.</p>
 <p>“Naive fool.” He turned scarily stern while a murderous bloodthirst surged from his glare like two great rivers of stars. It made the whole region tremble.</p>
 <p>Living beings shuddered before his current mood. His chilling voice echoed across the world: “Today, I shall cut you down and crush this lake. From today on, Dongting Lake will be no more.”</p>
 <p>“Boom!” A boundless vitality gushed out of his body. It engulfed the entire Dragon Demon Sea. What truly made others shiver was that an endless sea of blood appeared behind him. A terrifyingly gigantic shark was swimming in this sea. It created waves that towered for ten thousand miles and its enormous jaws seemed capable of swallowing the lake whole.</p>
 <p>“So powerful, this is the Bloodshark Village’s totem!” Many people trembled after seeing this. A powerful lineage was about to be swallowed by this gigantic bloodshark.</p>
 <p>Feiyan revealed a sinister smile after seeing the sovereign’s might. She sneered: “Li Qiye, doomsday is here for you. Even if you were a True Monarch or a Bestowed Monarch, you are powerless!”</p>
 <p>“Ignorant child, kneel and accept your death, or do I have to personally refine you?” The sovereign looked down on the world and its inhabitants. He carried a style as if he could annihilate this world.</p>
 <p>“I think only a Godking’s actual presence would be able to stop him.” An old paragon felt dread and said: “Li Qiye needs to be much stronger than a Bestowed Monarch.”</p>
 <p>“Just a fake god yet you dare to bark in front of me?” Li Qiye snorted: “There’s no need for me to personally slay an ant. Today, you shall open your dog eyes wide, and the same goes for all the sea demons here. Those who dare to act presumptuously before Dongting Lake shall be killed mercilessly!”</p>
 <p>Everyone was astounded after hearing this. Many sea demons angrily glared at him for this verbal provocation.</p>
 <p>Even the humans in the distance felt that he was being too arrogant. This was akin to challenging all the sea demons in the region — a very unwise decision.</p>
 <p>At this time, he shouted: “Banner, heed my call!” With a crashing sound, the banner that had been hanging in the middle of the lake’s chamber immediately rushed into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” It pinned itself into the sky, using the heaven and earth as its pole. Nothing could shake it.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The banner swept through the world. While fluttering in the wind, the silver fox embroidery came back to life. The fox’s tail seemed to come out as it entrenched itself in the physical realm. The gods all quaked with its coming.</p>
 <p>It was a silver fox with ferocious bloodthirst. Its appearance instilled shivers in everyone, no matter if they were gods or deities.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chanted: “Where is my Indomitable Battalion?!” The banner continued to dance with his call.</p>
 <p>Roars resounded. This was the resonating horn of war.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The lake water suddenly turned into a tsunami. It assaulted the sky and caused the stars to shake!</p>
 <p>When this tsunami disappeared, a battalion appeared in the sky. It was arranged in a rectangular formation with four calvaries stationed in each corner. Each cavalry had one commanding general.</p>
 <p>The whole world was enveloped in a harsh and somber aura. Every soldier in this battalion was formed from water. Nevertheless, people could still smell the stench of blood wafting from them.</p>
 <p>It was as if each warrior from this regiment had bathed in blood. They had arrived after walking through the bones of their enemies and had experienced countless battlefields.</p>
 <p>These battle-hardened troops were full of death, blood, and ruthlessness. Their motto was a single word: “Indomitable”!</p>
 <p>“The Indomitable Battalion of the Silver Fox Legion has finally come out.” Jian Longwei, watching from afar, was dazed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood under the banner while belittling the world. He coldly glared at the crowd and said: “All existences in the Dragon Demon Sea, open your eyes. From today on, those who dare to provoke Dongting Lake will only meet death!”</p>
 <p>The sovereign shouted: “Junior, I’ll kill you first!” His bloody tide engulfed the sky while the giant shark swam forward. Such an attack could shatter millions of miles of land and crush any helpless cultivator into a pulp.</p>
 <p>However, with the fluttering of the banner and the protection of the silver fox, his attack was stopped completely; it was unable to harm Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glared at the sovereign and commanded: “Slay them, slay them all!”</p>
 <p>“Kill!” The war horn blared again. The four generals led their troops and instantly attacked without any hesitation. They rushed with great speed towards the grand army from Wyvern and the village.</p>
 <p>Feiyan shouted her order: “Face them!”</p>
 <p>“In formation!” The great army frenziedly screamed in unison: “Kill them!”</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, they shifted their position to form two great formations. One turned into a gigantic dragon and the other a shark covered in blood. The dragon was thousands of miles long while the shark could devour the heavens. It was a frightening spectacle.</p>
 <p>This army had the absolute advantage when it came to numbers! The dragon-shaped formation immediately coiled around the attacking cavalries in order to take advantage of their numbers. Meanwhile, the bloodshark opened its mouth in order to take a bite out of the approaching enemies.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh!” However, these battle formations were useless before the Indomitable Battalion. This elite force quickly shattered their formations. Both the dragon and shark instantly disappeared. The regular army was again exposed before the cavalries.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The Indomitable Battalion mounted their offense like a raging storm and trampled over the opposing army.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh!” Screams continuously sounded left and right. The Indomitable Battalion harvested skulls as if they were harvesting wheat. Heads went flying as enemies fell to the ground with blood gushing from their corpses. The rain of red painted over the sky.</p>
 <p>In almost no time at all, the 100,000 strong army was sent into disarray. Even though the battalion was few in number, they were no different from a flood of steel. The other army wanted to counter-attack, but their defense and momentum had been shattered upon impact in the face of the hooves of the battalion.</p>
 <p>These calvaries had experienced countless wars, so they were practically unstoppable. An army of this level was simply no match for them. Only imperial legions were worthy of being their opponents, not babies like these!</p>
 <p>The screaming continued without pause during this massacre. Eventually, the army collapsed completely. Many disciples wanted to run, but they didn’t get far before being met with the scythes of these gods of death. Their heads rolled on the ground while they watched blood spurt from their severed necks.</p>
 <p>The disparity in strength was enormous. It was not an even battle at all! During this slaughter, some soldiers in the army didn’t even realize that they had lost before being decapitated.</p>
 <p>Mournful cries resounded through the heaven and earth. The King of Wyvern was killed by a general. This general raised Wyvern’s king’s body up high with his lance. Blood slowly dripped down from the corpse.</p>
 <p>Feiyan saw her father being crucified up high and let out a sharp howl: “No!!!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1277: Imitation Trident</b></p>
 <p>An army of one hundred thousand was slaughtered in the blink of an eye. The Indomitable cavalries swept through them like the wind blowing around autumn leaves without the slightest signs of stagnation. The difference in power was far too great.</p>
 <p>Everyone was shocked after this scene and couldn’t regain their sanity. The battle just now was too cruel and terrorizing. This was the scariest army they had ever witnessed — completely ruthless and invincible!</p>
 <p>“Among the four legions of the Dark Crow, the Tiger Legion is the most ferocious while the Silver Fox is the most crafty!” Jian Longwei exclaimed after the quick massacre: “This Indomitable Battalion is famous for being quite ruthless in the Silver Fox Legion as well as being the top elites. Zhang, Hong, Xu, and Lin… these four great generals had killed the generals under an Immortal Emperor before! How could this meager army be a match for them?”</p>
 <p>“Ancestor, have you seen the Silver Fox Legion before?” Jian Xiaotie’s hair was standing on end. This was the first time he saw such a scary regiment, the first time he witnessed such a sweeping victory!</p>
 <p>“No.” Jian Longwei shook his head in response: “I heard it from our progenitor. Legend states that the Silver Fox Legion is very mysterious and has followed His Excellency for a very long time. No one knows where they are, but when His Excellency requires their service, they will suddenly appear behind the enemies and destroy them within the shortest amount of time possible.”</p>
 <p>Jian Xiaotie murmured: “So this is the hidden power of Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>Longwei nodded: “That’s right. According to the rumors, after the Indomitable Battalion retired and died from old age, they buried their bodies and refined their true fates into heroic spirits. They prepared a supreme formation under the lake where these spirits have been sleeping ever since. They required the nourishment from this treasure land in order to maintain their form as a spectral army.”</p>
 <p>“Just think about it, Dongting Lake is part of the Dragon Mountain Range. In addition to getting the consent of the Dragon Kingdom, the important part is that they have the power to protect themselves.” Longwei gently sighed: “If they didn’t have this powerful protection, how could their current disciples possibly guard the lake? These sea demons are only a bunch of fools who think that they can take over the lake. They have forgotten about another problem. Who would dare to try and divide parts of the Dragon Mountain Range’s ancestral ground without permission from the Dragon God?”</p>
 <p>Xiaotie remained quiet. Their Grandfather was named Jian Longwei not at birth, but rather through a process of bestowment. This name represented a supreme glory.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei was just like his name, he was the guardian of the Giant Dragon Kingdom!</p>
 <p>After a very long time, some big shots from the previous generation finally calmed down.</p>
 <p>“The legend is true, it’s not a baseless assertion.” A paragon, aghast, took several steps back and murmured: “They are the mythical spirits of the saints that have always been protecting Dongting Lake.”</p>
 <p>For a very long time, rumors have been circulating in this sea, stating that Dongting Lake was protected by the saints of this world. However, many snorted at this claim, especially skeptical due to the decline of the lake. They believed that this was only a false rumor, that these spirits were intangible and baseless.</p>
 <p>However, everyone today saw these spirits in person, the real power of Dongting Lake that had been keeping watch over them.</p>
 <p>“How impudent!” With reddened eyes, the Bloodshark Sovereign crazily roared. He initially wanted to break the banner in the sky in order to kill Li Qiye. However, everything happened too quickly. His army was massacred so fast that it caused his eyes to flush red. Under a blinding rage, he wanted to kill the Indomitable Battalion.</p>
 <p>“Leave your dog life with me.” Li Qiye interjected while the sovereign was lunging for the battalion.</p>
 <p>“Little animal!” The sovereign instantly turned around and stared at Li Qiye in a frenzy.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slightly raised his right hand and slowly enunciated: “Trident, come.”</p>
 <p>His words turned into mantras and the mantras turned into laws.</p>
 <p>“Splash! Splash! Crash!” The water in the lake crazily churned as if it was boiling. A boundless divine light came from within.</p>
 <p>This light illuminated the world. A gigantic formation with countless engraved runes emerged from the lake. This great and ancient array was connected to the veins of the lake.</p>
 <p>At this time, the lake seemed to be a living entity, as if a dragon heart was beating within its earth. People could hear a powerful and resonating thump.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The light sprayed everywhere as if gods were descending to this world.</p>
 <p>Within this light, a great spear emerged. It was simple and natural. There were three sharp prongs at its tip. It looked like an ordinary decorative artifact, but such an ancient style resembled the opening of a world.</p>
 <p>It was clearly formed by the water in the lake, but it gave the sensation that it weighed billions of pounds. It seemed that outside of sea gods, no one could handle this great trident. [1. The raw is actually one hundred billion, but it is just being used as a large number and not an exact amount, so billions work better.]</p>
 <p>“The Trident!” Even someone as incredible as the sovereign turned silly after seeing this great weapon. He turned haggard and stumbled backward.</p>
 <p>The sea demons watching from a distance shouted its name as well. The masters from the other races all gasped.</p>
 <p>“Is that our sea god’s Trident?” The eyes of all the sea demons widened in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“No—” An old sea demon paragon carefully looked at this trident and was jolted. He quickly blurted: “This isn’t the real Trident, it’s only an imitation!”</p>
 <p>Many sea demons felt relieved after hearing this revelation. One of them murmured: “Lucky, it’s just a fake.”</p>
 <p>The Trident was the symbol of the sea demons. It carried the greatest significance in their hearts, the spiritual totem in their minds.</p>
 <p>Thus, only the supreme of their race, the sea god, was qualified to wield this invincible symbol.</p>
 <p>If the Trident fell into the hands of the humans, it would be too great of a blow to their race and drive them completely mad.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder why they were so worried. Ever since the start of Immortal Emperor Ta Kong’s generation, a sea god had yet to appear. The same was true for their Trident.</p>
 <p>The last sea god was Lithodidae; he appeared during Immortal Emperor Yin Long’s generation. [2. Ta Kong = Space Trample, Yin Long = Roaring Dragon.]</p>
 <p>So now, when the Trident appeared out of nowhere, all the sea demons naturally became alarmed. They thought that it had fallen into the clutches of Dongting Lake.</p>
 <p>Unlike the relieved sea demons, the Bloodshark Sovereign’s eyes were still glaring at the Trident.</p>
 <p>He was once accepted by the Trident, so he had it under his control during his youth. It was the most glorious time of his life. Back then, his cultivation soared by leaps and bounds. Many of his talented peers lost to him, including the young Lithodidae Sea God.</p>
 <p>This quick jump in power placed him among the top echelons. Later on, the Trident abandoned him for some reason and chose Lithodidae instead, allowing him to become a true sea god.</p>
 <p>Losing the Trident cut off his path to becoming a deity. From then on, his life fell into a trough. Even though he continued to cultivate and made progress, he couldn’t regain the surging years of yore and his old invincibility.</p>
 <p>Later on, since he wasn’t willing to give up, he also tried to create an imitation of the Trident. However, the only result was failure. These fake tridents didn’t have the same unstoppable power. Ultimately, they were only scrap metal.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t until many years of experimentation that he realized that he couldn’t understand the profundities of the true Trident. Creating a replica was simply impossible. In fact, many sea demons had tried to do so for millions of years now. Even for those who were successful in copying the Trident, the end result was a weapon much weaker than the real deal.</p>
 <p>His mind quivered as he looked at the Trident before him. Due to his past, he was very familiar with its power. Even though this was only an imitation, it had the unstoppable might of the real Trident.</p>
 <p>“Trident…” He was both scared and shocked. He didn’t expect to see such an imitation, his lifelong pursuit!</p>
 <p>However, he was also frightened because he knew the power that he was about to face!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1278: No Mercy</b></p>
 <p>The Trident was an eternal legend. Sea gods relied on this weapon to contend against Immortal Emperors. It was the reason why the two entities were considered even.</p>
 <p>The Trident was something unique to the sea demons. Its power even exceeded that of Immortal Emperor True Treasures.</p>
 <p>Even though the one ahead was only an imitation, the force exuding from it still deterred the sovereign’s very soul. It was something that belonged only to the real Trident.</p>
 <p>This imitation was no match for the real thing, but it still emitted a force capable of causing any sea demon to tremble.</p>
 <p>“This can’t be real…” The pale sovereign couldn’t believe his own eyes. Why did a human succeed in creating a copy of the Trident even though so many sea demons had failed? This was completely inconceivable to him.</p>
 <p>He quickly gathered his wits and shifted his body in order to cross through the void to escape. He had no desire to fight against this trident.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The great formation under the lake lit up. An infinite amount of power burst out like a volcanic eruption. In a short period of time, it pushed the trident flying as if a gigantic hand had just thrown it.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The void collapsed and a black hole emerged. Even though the sovereign had fled quite far, the Trident caught up to him in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Activate!” The sovereign was frightened by this pursuit, but he had no way out. He shouted and summoned his most powerful weapon while channeling his strongest defensive technique in order to stop the trident.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The Trident penetrated his weapon and barrier then continued to fly towards him with an unstoppable momentum.</p>
 <p>“No!” His mournful cry echoed across the ocean. Drops of blood fell into the sea and dyed it red.</p>
 <p>The sovereign was crucified to death just like that. His eyes were still wide open in disbelief. This was not the result he envisioned at all, thus he died with many regrets.</p>
 <p>The entire world turned gloomy. All the sea demons who saw this were aghast as a cold tingle went down their spines.</p>
 <p>The older sea demons questioned in a daze: “How can this be?”</p>
 <p>The Trident had ended the sovereign’s future once by abandoning him, and ultimately, an imitation ended his life. It seemed that this was all part of karma. The sovereign couldn’t escape his connection to the weapon. He owed it both glory and death. It was as if the heavens was playing a cruel joke on him.</p>
 <p>“That’s the hidden power of Dongting Lake.” The lake was now viewed as an object of fear. Everyone understood that the lake had an imitation trident on top of the spectral army.</p>
 <p>A charming spirit ancestor solemnly spoke: “So many years have passed, but the lake is still like before with its invincible power.”</p>
 <p>After seeing its power today, who would dare to have any ideas about it in the future?</p>
 <p>Even the disciples from the lake were slack-jawed. They had never imagined that things would play out this way. Hong Tianzhu, the other elders and the protectors were astonished as well. They never knew that the invincible ancestors had always been protecting them.</p>
 <p>Just recalling how they had abandoned everything from their ancestors for their own benefits left them ashamed. How could they stand and face their ancestors later on?</p>
 <p>For many, many years, the lake had never worshiped the ancestors with ceremonies. They had all but forgotten about the traditions, yet the ancestors still continued to protect their unfilial children and the lake. Their hearts were full of shame and regret.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the crowd was still deterred while watching the four cavalries in the sky. This spectral army could truly sweep through all enemies.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s cold voice resounded: “Don’t think about leaving when you’re already here.” It was chilling to the bones.</p>
 <p>Feiyan woke up from her stupor and sorrow. She wanted to escape as fast as possible. In her mind, as long as the verdant hills remained, there would be no fear of running out of firewood.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t get far before Li Qiye blocked her path. Her pretty face became twisted after seeing him. Moreover, it was blanched from both fear and fury with a touch of despair.</p>
 <p>This was the enemy who had killed both her father and little brother. She wanted nothing more than to tear him to pieces. However, reason told her that as long as she stayed alive, everything would be possible in the future, including killing this enemy to avenge her family.</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to die, for everything would turn to ashes afterward. Her sect was the Roaring Conch. As long as she could go back, she would have the opportunity for vengeance.</p>
 <p>These were the thoughts that occupied her mind. She stood there and didn’t dare to act rashly.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye fixated his gaze on her. All the spectators watched with bated breaths.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, many people were bullish about Feiyan because she had a strong backing. However, in the blink of an eye, the situation had reversed completely. Feiyan, who should have won for sure, became a dog with a dead owner.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly asked while looking at her: “Don’t you want to kill me?”</p>
 <p>While locking their eyes, Feiyan gritted her teeth, her smoldering fury evident in her gaze. She cried out his name: “Li Qiye!”</p>
 <p>He leisurely replied: “I understand your hatred.”</p>
 <p>“I want to peel your skin, drink your blood, and taste your flesh!” She shouted: “I swear to never live under the same sky with my father’s murderer!”</p>
 <p>“So what?” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded: “I am a ruthless person, not to mention that I have given you ample warnings, yet you still dared to oppose me. Therefore, you must experience the massacre.”</p>
 <p>She was livid. Her sworn enemy was standing in front of her, but there was nothing she could do.</p>
 <p>He continued on: “I’ll borrow your words. Kneel and accept death, or do I have to kill you myself?”</p>
 <p>She understood that there was no chance for survival, so she cried out: “Li, either you or I have to die. I would rather die if you exist in this world!”</p>
 <p>He insipidly replied: “Very well, at least you have some courage. Still better than your little brother, not begging before death.”</p>
 <p>“Li! Do you dare to fight me? If I lose, I will have no complaints. Otherwise, I will haunt you as a scornful ghost!” She made a clear decision since she knew there was no escaping. What she was worried about was the spectral army and the Trident from the lake.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “I’m not even afraid of gods, let alone mere ghosts.”</p>
 <p>She restrained her anger and continued with her plan of fighting him one on one. Even if she had to pay with her life to kill him, she would consider avenging her dead family a good end.</p>
 <p>“However, since you are so eager for revenge, I’ll satisfy your wish.” He smiled: “You think you actually have an opportunity, so I shall grant it to you. I like shattering someone’s self-esteem and confidence so that they can have a taste of despair.”</p>
 <p>She found a glimmer of hope in this desperate strait and immediately shouted: “Good, Li, this is your choice. We will fight one on one, a gentleman’s words cannot be taken back!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was amused and answered her coldly: “Don’t gauge a gentleman’s heart by using one’s own wretched scale. Don’t worry, I, Li Qiye, will always keep my word. Killing you won’t require any external help.”</p>
 <p>“Very well, we’ll fight to the death!” Feiyan felt jubilated after gaining a chance for revenge.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her with one eye and said: “Go, die in despair, a fate reserved for my enemies.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone held their breaths while watching this scene. Even though sea demons felt sympathy for Feiyan and wanted to help, none of them dared to try and rescue her.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1279: Seavinity Banner</b></p>
 <p>This marine region was drowned in a state of quietude. No one dared to breathe loudly as they watched the confrontation between Li Qiye and Shangguan Feiyan play out.</p>
 <p>“Summon!” Feiyan took out a banner and held the pole with one hand. An oceanic atmosphere assaulted the spectators; it was as if this flag was gestating a god.</p>
 <p>The sea demons here quivered before this banner. They felt an urge to kneel and worship due to an instinctive sense of respect that came from nowhere.</p>
 <p>“The Seavinity Banner, a weapon left behind by a sea god from the Roaring Conch!” Someone immediately shouted after seeing the banner. [1. Exact raw is Sea God’s Banner. Sea god is a term that is used too much already. For example, in that sentence, I would be repeating sea god twice. The other problem is that Sea God’s Banner sounds like a descriptor and not an actual artifact. What if another sea god has a banner? Thus, this made me want to use Divinity Banner or any other adjective similar to divine/hallowed, but this would leave the sea part out. Adding sea to it makes the title too long, and I’ve been hesitant towards using long titles for readability recently. Seavinity includes both; it is a made-up word, but for a proper name, this shouldn’t be an issue, especially after readers see this footnote and understand my thought process.]</p>
 <p>It instilled fear and awe into the spectators. This was the flag of a supreme sea demon; it represented their invincibility and glory.</p>
 <p>Even though the Trident was the most powerful weapon during the reign of all sea gods, they had no way of retaining it. When they died, the Trident would fly away and reappear when it was time to choose a successor in the next generation.</p>
 <p>Because of this, no one viewed the Trident as an inheritable weapon. Each sea god would create their own powerful artifacts and weapons, but none of them could compare to the Trident. However, these artifacts truly belonged to them and were able to be passed down to their descendants.</p>
 <p>The banner in Feiyan’s hand was a weapon created by a Roaring Conch Sea God.</p>
 <p>“She actually has a sea god’s weapon.” Both the young and old of the sea demon race became quite envious.</p>
 <p>Even though the Roaring Conch had two sea gods, it also had millions of disciples. It was quite a glory to inherit a sea god’s weapon. This was enough to show just how much the sect valued her.</p>
 <p>Feiyan shouted with the banner in her hand: “Li, you must stay true to your word, don’t change your mind in front of the world.”</p>
 <p>She was afraid that he would change his mind after seeing this weapon and wouldn’t want to fight her alone! After previously losing to him in just one move, she understood that her strength was no match for his. In her mind, he was at least a True Monarch or a Bestowed Monarch.</p>
 <p>Thus, she placed all of her hopes for revenge on this weapon! Because she was afraid of him reneging on the deal, she loudly shouted so that everyone could hear her. If Li Qiye were to change his mind today, his reputation would be destroyed.</p>
 <p>“You are too funny. Let alone make me change my mind, you actually think that you can do something to me with this sea god’s banner? This is such a blatant underestimation.” He shook his head and laughed: “Very well, since this banner is giving you so much faith in your revenge, I’ll shatter it.”</p>
 <p>With that, a saber hymn resonated through the sky. With a saber in his hand, he coldly stared at her.</p>
 <p>An imperial aura engulfed the region with its coming. With the Benevolent Saber in his hand, an immortal aura surfaced around his hand. The weapon seemed to become one with him.</p>
 <p>This blade was the true fate weapon of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Its creation required painstaking efforts from both the emperor and Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Today, his ability to wield the blade was no less than if the emperor was using it himself. The only thing missing was the Heaven’s Will. If Li Qiye had the Heaven’s Will, he would be able to exert the same power from this blade as the emperor of past.</p>
 <p>“An Immortal Emperor True Treasure!” Hailing from the Roaring Conch, Feiyan knew her stuff. Her face paled as she stumbled backward.</p>
 <p>At this moment, her pupils contracted, revealing both fear and despair! Even though she had a sea god’s banner, the blade in Li Qiye’s hand was a true treasure!</p>
 <p>With respect to comparing the weapons of sea gods and Immortal Emperors, the Trident was the first part of the equation. True treasures were no match for its power — this was the reason why sea gods could fight against Immortal Emperors!</p>
 <p>However, without the Trident, sea gods were only Emperor Assailants at best; they couldn’t truly fight against a real emperor. Because of this, the arsenals they personally create were no match for imperial weapons, let alone a True Treasure.</p>
 <p>Despair reared its ugly head again in Shangguan Feiyan. It was just like Li Qiye had said, her hope had been shattered.</p>
 <p>The banner that she thought would allow her to get revenge for her father and brother paled in comparison before his True Treasure!</p>
 <p>Many sea demons were astounded to see his weapon as well.</p>
 <p>A sea demon blurted in disbelief: “Isn’t he the successor of Peacock Land? A tree controller? Since when did he become a descendant of an Immortal Emperor? To actually have a True Treasure!”</p>
 <p>Many knew about Li Qiye’s status as Peacock Land’s successor, but no one would ever have thought that he would be the owner of a True Treasure as well.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye insipidly said: “I told you that I would crush your hope.” [1. This is too cruel now…]</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” Li Qiye poured his vitality into the blade. At this moment, he seemed to be incredibly far away, as if he was standing above the nine layers of the heavens.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The world trembled. Li Qiye unexpectedly emitted the aura of an Immortal Emperor. The blade lit up, allowing its snow-white edge to illuminate the horizon. The blade itself seemed to be returning to life as an eternal existence.</p>
 <p>“How, how can this be?” Many people were dazed as Li Qiye seemingly turned into an emperor. Many of the people with weaker cultivations dropped to the ground due to weakened knees under his pressure.</p>
 <p>They found it completely inconceivable as they gazed at Li Qiye in the sky.</p>
 <p>“No way! Even a Godking can’t bring an Immortal Emperor True Treasure back to life!” A commenter’s voice was trembling.</p>
 <p>“It is because he has been recognized by the True Treasure. This is quite rare no matter the generation.” A human who understood these weapons understood what was happening.</p>
 <p>“Thump. Thump. Thump.” Feiyan kept on faltering before this scene. True despair had struck her.</p>
 <p>“Li, I’ll die with you!” Feiyan plunged into madness. She spat a great amount of longevity blood onto the banner. Her complexion turned deathly white afterward.</p>
 <p>This determined her demise. Despite her young age, she had used all of her blood as an offering for the banner. Even if she could win this fight, she wouldn’t be able to live much longer due to her withered lifespan.</p>
 <p>“Aiming for mutual destruction… even victory won’t let her stay alive.” Everyone knew that it was over for her.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” After the refinement, the banner became much more brilliant and poured down gigantic universal laws. These pillar-like laws plunged into the vast sea.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” Tidal waves of endless height assaulted the sky. All of these pillars of water intertwined with the laws to turn into a stout figure.</p>
 <p>At this time, the banner coiled around this aquatic figure, turning it into a deity. If was as if a sea god had returned to life. This figure turned and opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The world quaked with his coming. His celestial flames engulfed the entire region. The grand aura emanating from this sea god spread across the Dragon Demon Sea as if a real sea god was here in person.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency!” Many sea demons were stirred and prostrated on the water. Some even broke into tears.</p>
 <p>An astonished human asked in horror: “Is that a resurrected sea god?”</p>
 <p>“No.” An older human gently shook his head and explained: “This is a tribute. She used all of her longevity blood in order to bring about one invincible strike from a sea god! All of the forces from the weapon have been gathered into this blow. Victory or defeat will depend on it.”</p>
 <p>“Can Li Qiye withstand a blow from a sea god?” Miss Lin’s group was quite worried after seeing the gigantic figure.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1280: Public Execution</b></p>
 <p>An invincible attack from a sea god would take everyone’s breath away. Countless beings quivered in fear before this suppressive aura.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The saber sang again and became exceedingly bright. The blade itself disappeared to turn into the world’s most brilliant light. It illuminated the ten continents and imprisoned everything with its resplendence.</p>
 <p>It was the combination of an imperial aura and an unstoppable saber intent that culminated within Li Qiye. This saber intent rose above the heaven and earth before suppressing the Yin and Yang. Up in the sky, Li Qiye was the saber and the saber was him.</p>
 <p>A peerless blade — there was no better word to describe this current saber intent. It was omnipresent and engulfed the entire world; there was no escaping it.</p>
 <p>At this second, everyone could feel themselves being immersed in its intent instead of the sunlight. It was as if the Benevolent Saber had replaced the sun over yonder.</p>
 <p>“He has not only been accepted by the weapon, he has also mastered an invincible dao of the saber. With the blade in his hand, he can combat an endless horde of foes!” Even God-Monarchs felt chills while looking at Li Qiye becoming one with his weapon.</p>
 <p>“Die!” There was no other way for Feiyan. She let out a cry after offering everything she had. This moment would either end in the death of her or Li Qiye. She wouldn't mind mutual destruction either.</p>
 <p>Her only choice was to face him directly. Death was certain whether she tried to flee or fight, so she might as well go all out!</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” As her battle intent surged, the sea god made out of water stepped towards the sky. Each of his steps shattered the void as if it was made from porcelain. This was a magnificent scene.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the laws of the grand dao were screaming. They couldn’t contend against this sea god.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The figure finally attacked with a hand that stretched across the world in the form of a mudra. Ancient aquatic runes erupted like a volcano. Each rune resembled a tiny star. These stars then came together to crush everything in its path to ashes.</p>
 <p>People’s souls left their bodies the moment this sea god’s mudra emerged. Its power of suppression sank deep to the soul; everyone was completely powerless under its might. They were currently helpless kittens and as insignificant as specks of dust — not enough to reach the apex.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye made his move against this mudra. His blade traveled through the sky and illuminated myriad eras. It severed the Yin and Yang and extinguished the karmic cycle.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” One sabre to alarm countless realms. This light lit up every single corner of the world, even hell itself was no exception. The gods and devils had nowhere to hide.</p>
 <p>This was the first of the three Benevolent Slashes, nothing in this world could hide from its brilliance! Everything became straightforward and clear. Dark and light, Yin and Yang, life and death — everything lost their abstruseness in the face of this slash.</p>
 <p>It was no longer just a saber technique but a type of righteous will that belonged to Immortal Emperor Min Ren. He wished to save all sentient beings.</p>
 <p>Everyone would feel inadequate and ashamed when met with this attack. Evil had no place to hide; it would turn into smoke from this illumination. Sea gods and devils seemed especially insignificant in the face of this attack.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This slash didn’t waste time as it severed the sea god’s mudra and the divine creature itself.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The water returned to the ocean like waterfalls as the gigantic figure slowly disappeared.</p>
 <p>The banner was left in the sky, but a corner of it had been cut off by the Benevolent Saber.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The damaged banner howled and quickly fled to the horizon.</p>
 <p>“No—” The one to scream was not Shangguan Feiyan, but rather a few of the spectating sea demons.</p>
 <p>It was too great of a blow for them. A sea god was killed; their supreme had been defeated.</p>
 <p>A sea demon sect master murmured in a daze: “That’s not a real sea god anyway, it was just a battle intent of the weapon.” Even though he was correct, it didn’t hide the sadness in his mind.</p>
 <p>“Slaughtering a god…” The human cultivators, on the other hand, felt their blood boiling.</p>
 <p>Keep in mind that in the current Dragon Demon Sea, sea demons reigned supreme. Sea gods were untouchable existences and were considered to be invincible in this race’s minds.</p>
 <p>But today, the Benevolent Saber came out and immediately killed the sea god in addition to severing a piece of the banner. This was a blow to the confidence and morale of the sea demons.</p>
 <p>The humans were elated by this event. This would go down as a glorious part of their race’s history.</p>
 <p>A human couldn’t hide his pride and resoundingly exclaimed: “Our Immortal Emperors are invincible, regardless of the era!”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei witnessed this scene and emotionally spoke: “The Benevolent Three Slashes are said to be the emperor’s proudest saber techniques. Some even say that he placed it even higher in his heart than his Heaven’s Will Secret Law. A rumor states that this technique combined with the saber is completely unstoppable unless the opponent has the Heaven’s Will!”</p>
 <p>Feiyan was petrified like a statue. The thing she relied on the most had flown away after being defeated. Her only hope has been shattered, so she stood there in a daze.</p>
 <p>“Kneel and accept death.” Li Qiye emotionlessly stared at her with his blade pointing straight at her.</p>
 <p>Feiyan’s mind returned. She immediately tumbled backward with no color in her complexion.</p>
 <p>She shouted: “Never!” Even at this moment of defeat, she still held her head up proudly.</p>
 <p>With the shining blade in his hand and a surging saber intent, Li Qiye coldly uttered like a supreme emperor: “It is not up to you to decide!” The imperial aura continued to assault the world. His order was completely irresistible.</p>
 <p>These auras absolutely trampled over her pride. With a bang, her knees gave in to the pressure.</p>
 <p>“No!” Even before death, she still stubbornly derived laws in order to turn into a phoenix and soar to the sky. In her mind, she would rather commit suicide than be killed while kneeling.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” However, her transformation was quickly put down by the saber intent. Her struggle only weakened her. She prostrated on the ground with her kneecaps shattered.</p>
 <p>Her resistance could have been stronger. Unfortunately, she had offered all of her longevity blood to the Seavinity Banner, so she no longer had the same strength as before.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly raised his blade and declared: “In this world, I don’t care about those who oppose me. Even a defeated enemy can be allowed a dignified death. However, those who think that my human race has become weak and tiny enough to become slaves or incubators, mere objects for sex... I shall destroy their entire race and devoid them of a dignified death…”</p>
 <p>“I am not the guardian of the human race or the savior of this world. However, sea demons and treants, listen to me well: I am a human, so if you wish to enslave my people, think carefully about the consequences!” Each of his words was resounding and sonorous with determination. They pierced straight into everyone’s minds.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” The blade chopped down and Feiyan’s head flew up. It eventually rolled on the ground as her blood gushed and stained the sky red before dripping down into the sea.</p>
 <p>A beloved daughter of the heavens, a genius of the sea demons, a young God-Monarch was beheaded while kneeling. This scene shook the heart — this was especially true for the suffocated sea demon spectators.</p>
 <p>“Our race might be weak, but we will never become slaves!” A human cultivator had tears in his eyes while he tightly clenched his fists.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, the human race was quite weak. Cultivators from the Exquisite Valley were better off, but as for vagabonds or smaller sects, they suffered bullying and repression from the sea demons everywhere.</p>
 <p>Today, Li Qiye’s actions made the crowd jubilant with pride.</p>
 <p>As for the sea demons, they stayed silent before this blatant provocation in the form of an execution. They knew that without sufficient strength, opposing Li Qiye was suicidal!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye put away the Benevolent Saber and returned to the banner. He gazed at the horizon and commanded without mercy: “Indomitable Legion, heed my order. Destroy Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. When the sun rises tomorrow, they must be no more.”</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The battalion answered with action. The expedition had begun as the troops separated into two groups. One headed straight for Wyvern while the other aimed for the village.</p>
 <p>This invincible regiment instantaneously crossed through space.</p>
 <p>Someone without any knowledge of its origin murmured in a daze: “This, this spectral army is too invincible…”</p>
 <p>An old charming spirit ancestor watching from the distance murmured: “A legion from the legends… Even an imperial legion suffered continuous defeats. Even if they have died and turned into ghosts, they are still invincible! A truly unstoppable force.”</p>

 <p><strong>Chapter 1281: Massacring The Enemies</strong></p>
 <p>There was no suspense to the Indomitable Battalion’s expedition. Remember that they once bested an imperial legion time after time on the battlefield with a matchless momentum.</p>
 <p>Today, it didn’t matter how strong Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village were, they were simply no match.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” On this day, this sea region was sent into turmoil with tsunamis everywhere as if the ocean itself was howling.</p>
 <p>“Kill!” The echoes of war resounded in both Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village. Alarms rang everywhere as defensive barriers were erected in their ancestral grounds.</p>
 <p>Alas, despite mustering all of their strength with elites rushing to the battlefield alongside their ancestors, they couldn’t change their fate against the iron hooves of the Indomitable Battalion.</p>
 <p>“Kill them…” Eventually, the war cries grew weaker. The lucky survivors stopped being so lucky on the battlefield. Their blood dyed the ocean red while their corpses floated on its surface.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Eventually, the regiment shattered the ancestral grounds of the two sects. In just one night, two great powers had been erased from the Dragon Demon Sea. The disciples who managed to survive basically lost everything with the loss of their ancestral grounds.</p>
 <p>One day prior, the army of 100,000 was very confident in their conquest of the lake. The troops were full of morale. In their eyes, on top of winning their resources, they could also enslave the lake’s women and use the excellent bloodlines of the human race to reproduce.</p>
 <p>They were extremely excited for their triumphant return. Then, it would be time to drown in the debaucherous feasts and pleasures.</p>
 <p>However, they never thought that this would be their last expedition. It turned into a sect-destroying disaster. Not only did they fail to destroy the lake, the lake's spectral army destroyed all of them instead.</p>
 <p>The demise of these two sects caused ripples across the entire sea demon race.</p>
 <p>Even though these two were far weaker than sea god lineages, they were plenty strong and could be listed among the top ten in this sea region. However, they were annihilated as if they were nothing.</p>
 <p>In the end, the Indomitable Battalion returned to the banner. They were still as emotionless and cold as before. No matter the time, they seemed to be drowned in a sea of blood.</p>
 <p>Countless people felt a stinging shiver deep in their hearts in the face of this spectral army. This was a true machine of war!</p>
 <p>While hovering under the banner, Li Qiye coldly uttered: “Those who covet Dongting Lake, I hope all of you have gotten a good look.”</p>
 <p>People felt suffocated when they heard his words. The sea demons who wanted to take advantage of the situation were breaking out in cold sweat.</p>
 <p>They praised their own fortune for not going forward earlier. Otherwise, they would have suffered the same fate as the two great powers.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The lake water gushed as the battalion sank into the lake, disappearing completely. They became one with the lake; as long as the lake continued to exist, so would they.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.” The supreme formation of the lake opened only to close after the Trident flew in.</p>
 <p>A lot of sea demons stared at it with envy. Even experts from sea god lineages were quite jealous because many sea gods had tried to copy the Trident to no avail. Everyone knew that this weapon before them was only an imitation, but it was still extremely strong.</p>
 <p>Envy and jealousy were one thing, but no one dared to have any ideas about it. They weren’t tired of living just yet.</p>
 <p>“This is the foundation of the lake.” An old paragon murmured: “No wonder why no one tried to do anything against the lake in the past. It would be too reckless.”</p>
 <p>The disciples of the lake stared at this scene with astonishment. They never thought their lake had something this powerful up its sleeves.</p>
 <p>In the end, the silver fox disappeared. The war banner flew back into the chamber and hung itself on the wall once more.</p>
 <p>Serenity came with the end of this battle. Many people assumed that the lake was about to be destroyed. No one expected Wyvern and the village to perish instead.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave one last glance at everyone before returning to the lake. Hong Tianzhu’s group immediately followed him back.</p>
 <p>The crowd was relieved to see him gone.</p>
 <p>An old man murmured: “That guy is too heaven-defying. With him here in Heaven Spirit, it looks like the humans will have an Immortal Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“Way to state the obvious.” The human cultivators were naturally feeling very proud right now: “He is a tree controller, the master of Dongting Lake and also a prince of an imperial lineage. Who can become the Immortal Emperor of this generation other than him?”</p>
 <p>Of course, these humans didn’t know Li Qiye’s identity and were only blurting out their thoughts. In their eyes, as long as Li Qiye became an Immortal Emperor, it would be the glory of the human race. No amount of praise would be sufficient for him at this moment.</p>
 <p>The sea demons were quiet with ugly expressions. After all, Li Qiye had dealt too many blows to their race recently. His dispatch of the Teeming Fish and utilization of the spectral army to deal with two great powers destroyed the sea demons’ morale and left them breathless.</p>
 <p>“Our sea demons also have some supreme geniuses.” A sea demon felt like retorting because Li Qiye’s fame was at an all-time high.</p>
 <p>“Yes, our supreme geniuses have yet to take action.” Another sea demon echoed the sentiment: “We still have the Seashield Prince and Seven Martial Goddess. Rumor has it that if the prince has a grand completion Immortal Physique, he could assail an Immortal Emperor. If he could become a sea god, he’ll be even more formidable with the Trident.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, there’s no need to raise the enemy’s prestige while lowering our morale.” An older sea demon rallied his people: “The goddess is incredible too. She is a peerless prodigy that has learned the seven grand styles, so who can actually stop her in the present? As long as she uses her techniques, even a Godking will have to make way.”</p>
 <p>Another sea demon replied: “Yes! The seven grand styles of the martial pavilion are unstoppable. Even the secret laws of Immortal Emperors cannot compare to them. Just remember that back then, the sea god from the pavilion used the seven styles to fight against an emperor. Who in this world could withstand all seven styles?”</p>
 <p>“The moment the seven styles appear, its user will be unbeatable.” Whether the sea demons were getting nervous or just wanted to raise their morale, the praise went on: “I’m afraid even Immortal Emperors can’t stop all seven styles. Hmph, there’s no way that a junior can do it.”</p>
 <p>The styles of the Seven Martial Pavilion were indeed legendary. These praises weren’t mere exaggerations.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, some people believed that anyone who could learn all seven would be able to assail an Immortal Emperor even without becoming a sea god. This was the greatest martial technique in the world!</p>
 <p>In fact, the sea demons who were desperately praising the seven styles had never seen them before or knew what the stances were.</p>
 <p>This was because these styles were rarely used. Another believer stated that there was no one alive who had witnessed all seven because no one could withstand the entire barrage!</p>
 <p>A human was tired of the boasting and coldly uttered: “Hmph, Immortal Physique? Seven grand styles? So what, we have Li Qiye.”</p>
 <p>“Well, Li Qiye won’t be invincible to the very end. Hidden dragons and crouching tigers are everywhere in Heaven Spirit. Not to mention us sea demons, the Jade Sea has countless descendants of treefathers and bearers of the finest of bloodlines. And over at the Abyss Sea, charming spirits are the favorite children of the heavens, they are destined to be great.”</p>
 <p>Another sea demon retorted: “Yes, you humans shouldn’t forget about the charming spirits. There are countless powerful spirits that don’t care about fame or fortune. Not to mention the Profound Monarch, rumor has it that the Puresun Daoist of the Ancient Spirit Island has reached grand completion in the Indestructible Diamond Physique. Some people might not be well-known, but it is only because they are low-key. Not everyone likes to show off all the time. The real masters rarely show themselves.”</p>
 <p>It was really a bad day for the sea demons. Their arrogance had been completely snuffed out by Li Qiye and they were unable to oppose him, so boasting was the only thing they could do.</p>
 <p>The smart humans didn’t reply after hearing this answer from the sea demons with regards to real masters. A retort would only be offending the treants and the charming spirits. There would be nowhere to go if they were to be found out.</p>
 <p>Of course, those who knew the truth like Jian Longwei didn’t care enough to mince their words: “This is a case of using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken. In this generation, for both sea demons and charming spirits, if they still think their race is invincible, a second massacre like the one just now might repeat itself.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1282: Turning Over A New Page</b></p>
 <p>Inside the chamber of the lake, Li Qiye returned to the master chair with a natural and nonchalant demeanor, yet he still gave off a stately and imposing aura.</p>
 <p>He was supreme in his throne and capable of deterring emperors and gods. No one would dare to disobey his orders.</p>
 <p>The elders, protectors and supervisors of the lake all participated in this gathering. They quietly sat in their positions while respectfully gazing at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The walls were still decorated with the portraits and a banner in the center. In the past, even the disciples of the lake didn’t care about these portraits.</p>
 <p>But today, everyone from the lake felt an instinctive reverence towards these decorations without exception. Before entering the chamber, they would tidy their clothes and posture without showing the slightest sign of disrespect.</p>
 <p>It was because this place represented the glory of their ancestors and the highest authority of the lake.</p>
 <p>The four Virtuous Ancestors had been killed while the other ancestors were imprisoned. This caused a great stir in the lake and a monumental change to its current power structure.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly looked at everyone present. The high-ranking members here felt a chill run down their spines from his glare.</p>
 <p>“After today, everyone should understand the glory of the lake as well as your own responsibilities.” Li Qiye flatly said: “I have returned the glory of past to all of you once more as well as control of the lake and its future direction…”</p>
 <p>“... In the future, whether Dongting Lake shall deter the world and illuminate the nine continents or continue to fall like a group of stray dogs vying for bones and power will be up to each and every one of you!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye went on: “Its future is in your hands now. The younger generation will be the ones to hold the reigns, not those old geezers blinded by power!”</p>
 <p>With that, he shifted his eyes over to the outstanding disciples like Hong Yujiao.</p>
 <p>In the past, not even the elders could show up in these deliberations. The majority of the grand events were secretly decided upon by the ancestors. Now, even the youngest disciple was allowed to participate.</p>
 <p>“Your ancestors have laid a solid foundation for everyone, a magnificent starting point.” Li Qiye stated: “I have restored this foundation. With such an ace, I won’t get involved again regardless of the lake’s fate if all of you can’t amount to anything.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, rest assured. From today on, we will not dishonor the glory of our ancestors or disgrace them in any way. Our generation shall obey the iron creeds and inherit the union. We swear on this with our true fates and definitely won’t let you down.” Hong Tianzhu prostrated on the ground and resoundingly swore with his true fate!</p>
 <p>In his eyes, this was the best time to change the lake. If they were to miss this moment, it would be prohibitively difficult to try again later on.</p>
 <p>The other members glanced at each other and read the situation very well. They quickly prostrated just like Hong Tianzhu and swore with their true fates as well: “Our lake shall obey the iron creeds and inherit the union once more without regret!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly nodded approvingly: “Very good, it is for the best that everyone has this much determination. Do not bring dishonor to your ancestors’ glorious bloodline.”</p>
 <p>These high-elders and those of lower rankings had all the authority in the lake right now and had sworn with their true fates to obey the ancestral teachings once more. From today on, the lake would turn over a new page.</p>
 <p>“Dongting Lake was created together by the Xu, Lin, Hong, and Zhang Clans. As their descendants, remember this, your lake also includes the Zhang Clan!” Li Qiye flatly said: “I don’t care how your ancestors divided the docks in the past, just remember that from today on, the eighteen docks belong to the lake and not any individual clan! It is time to hand over these resources in a sensible manner.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Baitu was also present. Li Qiye’s words left Hong Tianzhu’s group and those of the previous generation embarrassed. The Zhang Clan was squeezed out of the lake completely while the other clans divided up their docks.</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu hurriedly said: “Young Noble, the Hong Clan shall hand our seven docks back to the lake. We will distribute the heavenly grottos and roads as well in accordance with the iron creeds.”</p>
 <p>In fact, the Hong Clan was very powerful right now since they had seven out of the eighteen docks. Nevertheless, Hong Tianzhu was the first to give these resources back to the lake.</p>
 <p>“Our Lin Clan is also willing to return our five docks.” The others came forward and willingly gave back their territories.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded: “This is for the best. The lake’s future will be in your hands. Remember, your clans must unite with great solidarity just like your ancestors. Competing for petty authority and power will only lead the lake down a path of destruction. Your internal conflicts will destroy you before your enemies can even make a move.”</p>
 <p>Some elders felt their faces burn after hearing this. It wasn’t that the lake wasn’t strong or lacked resources. Unfortunately, ever since those Virtuous Ancestors focused on gaining more power, outsiders started to think that the lake was easy to bully. Ultimately, even lineages like the Bloodshark Village and Wyvern threatened them with military expeditions.</p>
 <p>“The four regiments have returned to their positions. The iron creeds shall take effect once more.” Li Qiye looked at them and said: “From today on, a new page shall be turned for Dongting Lake. This is all I will do to help, the future will be up to you all.”</p>
 <p>With that, he got up from his chair and took one last glimpse at the banner and portraits before leaving the chamber.</p>
 <p>The members present were quiet. They lowered their heads with countless emotions running through their minds.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was an outsider, yet he could control their lake’s spectral army and the Trident. Moreover, his own power could suppress everyone here. However, he didn’t even take a single glance at this great force before him. He had no love for the authority here nor did he demand their resources.</p>
 <p>As for themselves, the lake clearly belonged to everyone, but they selfishly killed and marginalized each other, resulting in great disunity. As the descendants of the clans, they never treated the lake as their own home, only a feast to be divided.</p>
 <p>No matter how they looked at it, it was a very shameful matter. They had let down their ancestors.</p>
 <p>While drowning in this shame, many elders and protectors clenched their fists. If they didn’t cherish and protect their own home, why would others respect them? The lake was the home of every disciple and descendant, it didn’t belong to an individual.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t leave the lake right away. He stayed for several days to bask in the atmosphere of this place while fully enjoying the scenic waters.</p>
 <p>This might his last chance to stay at the lake. In the future, he might never come back, so he wanted to rest and make some new memories.</p>
 <p>He sighed while looking at the sparkling water. Countless heroic souls were buried at the bottom of the lake. In their final moments, they decided to refine their souls and turned into spectral soldiers that permanently rested in this place.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of others, such actions prevented them from entering the reincarnation cycle. To be reincarnated was a source of hope for many cultivators, so they would never be willing to do such a thing.</p>
 <p>However, this once invincible battalion ultimately chose to do so. It was because of their great love and attachment to this land. Even in death, they chose to protect this land and their descendants.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sentimentally reflected: “Perhaps this is the best place for home.” In the long years, everyone had their own path.</p>
 <p>At this time, someone knocked on the door.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye focused his mind and lightly spoke: “Come in.”</p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1283: Be A Maid?</b></p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu walked in and bowed after seeing Li Qiye: “Greetings, Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded in response: “Keep at it. As long as you try your best, the lake’s future will be just fine.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu indeed had the will and ambition to change and strengthen the lake. Alas, his ability was still lacking.</p>
 <p>“Thank you. Without Young Noble, the lake would not be like this today. We shall remember your kindness for generations to come.” Tianzhu bowed once more.</p>
 <p>Tianzhu thought that without Li Qiye, even if he wanted to make a change, it would have been useless. Even if the talented young disciples were on his side, he still wouldn’t be able to do anything to the ancestors, let alone the four Virtuous Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“No need to thank me.” Li Qiye sat there while looking at the lake and answered: “I did it because of your determination. This is also the blessing of your ancestors, so if you want to thank someone, thank your ancestors. They are the ones who are lying in the ground; dead for millions of years, yet they are still worried about their children.”</p>
 <p>“I know your abilities are limited.” Li Qiye looked at him: “From now on, go ask Jian Longwei for help. This will be good for both your cultivation and ability to make allies…”</p>
 <p>“Can, can I do it?” He wasn’t completely confident and scratched his head in response.</p>
 <p>Even though he was the current master of Dongting Lake, Jian Longwei was the Jian Grandfather, a supreme character. Hong Tianzhu would be reaching above his post.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll let them know.” Li Qiye flatly replied: “The truth is that the lake and the Jian Clan had a deep friendship. Unfortunately, due to your clan’s failures, the Jian Clan decided to ignore you later on. Of course, they cannot be blamed for this.”</p>
 <p>“I understand.” Tianzhu lowered his head in shame. In the past, the lake had many allies and even strong ties with the Exquisite Valley. Unfortunately, when the four Virtuous Ancestors abandoned the iron creeds, they destroyed their own future.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued while looking upon the lake: “Even now, I do not agree with humans staying in the Heaven Spirit World. Your ancestors had opportunities to settle down in the other places of the nine worlds. However, they had too much love and attachment to this land, so they ultimately decided to stay here.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu quietly listened since he knew very little about his ancestors’ past.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shook his head forlornly and looked at Tianzhu: “No matter what, the lake is deeply related to the Giant Dragon Mountain Range. Your ancestors prepared this land very well, so it is up to you now. If you fail to correct yourselves, the existence above the clouds will stop caring about your lake. As long as you keep on trying, your lake will be able to stand strong in the future.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye rarely said such thoughtful words, but he did so this time out of consideration for the lake’s ancestors.</p>
 <p>He reminded Tianzhu: “Remember, with their spirits protecting you, even in difficult times of monumental change, there will always be a chance to overcome the disasters. You must protect this land just like they did or you would be unfilial and completely unworthy of their love.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu carefully took in every single word. Even though he didn’t fully understand the true implications behind them, he still firmly memorized them.</p>
 <p>He bowed once more: “I’ll engrave your golden advice in my heart.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded and quietly stared back at the lake. One day, a disaster shall befall the Heaven Spirit World. Everything would change at that point.</p>
 <p>In the end, he chose not to think about it. He would no longer be in Heaven Spirit when that day comes. Their fate is in their own hands.</p>
 <p>“Is there something else?” His mind returned and he noticed that Tianzhu was still standing there respectfully.</p>
 <p>“Well…” Tianzhu wryly coughed with an awkward posture. He didn’t know how to phrase his question.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lightly urged: “Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>After thinking for half a day, Tianzhu still didn’t know what to say. Eventually, he decided to directly ask: “Young Noble, what do you think about my daughter?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled in response: “She is not a bad lady — full of potential. Her temperament might be a bit too fiery, but she is still quite sensible.”</p>
 <p>“Ah. Young Noble, you are too kind.” Tianzhu smiled. He mused a bit before gritting his teeth to ask: “Young Noble, if you think it is possible, how, how about she go along with you?”</p>
 <p>After saying what was on his mind, he felt relieved, as if he had carried out his responsibility.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled without replying, so Tianzhu quickly added: “Young Noble, don’t misunderstand. You are a true dragon from the nine heavens, so my daughter can’t climb up that high. What I mean is, she can run errands for you and do whatever she can to help. This will broaden her horizons and train her insight.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu knew full well that Li Qiye would one day soar to the sky. He could even become an Immortal Emperor one day, and his daughter naturally couldn’t become the imperial queen.</p>
 <p>He only wanted her to follow him for the experience. Even by being a maid, she would still gain a lifetime of benefits.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “Your daughter is a good girl, but unfortunately, I can’t keep her around.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu didn’t give up, he wanted a good future for his daughter. Staying at the lake would only limit her life’s experience. As for him, his responsibility dictated that he would die here. It was not the same for her, he wanted her to see the vast world. Without a doubt, Li Qiye was the best person to entrust her to.</p>
 <p>“It is not that I dislike her.” Li Qiye gently stated: “But she cannot follow my path.”</p>
 <p>Tianzhu held his tongue after not knowing what to say while feeling disappointed.</p>
 <p>“Father, I have my own life, so I will go down my own path.” Yujiao rushed in from outside. She was a little red and looked a bit annoyed. She had clearly heard Li Qiye earlier.</p>
 <p>“Sister, don’t go in.” Another girl was startled by her sudden intrusion and was trying to pull her back. It was Miss Lin. She couldn’t stop Yujiao at all.</p>
 <p>Tianzhu quickly scolded: “Why did you come in?”</p>
 <p>“Father, I am not a child, I don’t need you to arrange everything for me.” Yujiao stomped her foot after saying this, both anger and embarrassment evident in her expression.</p>
 <p>Tianzhu hastily reprimanded: “Don’t spout nonsense or be rude in front of Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>Yujiao felt that she couldn’t stay here any longer due to shame, so she angrily stormed away.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, my daughter was impolite just now. I’ll go talk to her.” Tianzhu bowed and apologized to Li Qiye before chasing after her.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t care too much about Yujiao’s little tantrum.</p>
 <p>With those two gone, only Li Qiye and Miss Lin were left in the room. She tensed up and didn’t even know where to rest her hands as she was simply too nervous.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister is a good person, she was just a little bit angry earlier, that’s all.” She spoke soft words to defend Yujiao.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile while looking at this girl as gentle as an orchid. He eventually asked: “What is your name?”</p>
 <p>Her heart fluttered as she was stunned like a fawn and began to stammer: “My, my name is Lin Miao.”</p>
 <p>She raised her head to look at Li Qiye only to blush before immediately lowering her face.</p>
 <p>She was normally not such a timid person. She could greet guests and communicate freely and gracefully. However, she was especially tense in front of Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“The holy and wonderful bloodline of the Lin Clan.” He looked at her and nodded.</p>
 <p>The nervous girl nodded multiple times in response: “Yes, yes, but Senior Sister's bloodline is even better than mine. My holy bloodline can’t compare to hers.” Her cheeks were flushed pink.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1284: Lin Miao</b></p>
 <p>Looking at the girl lowering her finely-sculpted forehead, Li Qiye gently shook his head: “There are no good or bad bloodlines, no one is born destined to be noble or wretched.”</p>
 <p>“Really?” She secretly stole glances at him before nervously retracting them right after.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye insisted in a serious manner: “I don’t need to lie to you. My words are true and come from the heart.”</p>
 <p>“I, I didn’t mean to question your words…” Lin Miao thought that he was offended and almost started crying.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye wryly smiled at this tense girl and said: “Sit down, we’ll have a talk about bloodlines.”</p>
 <p>She hesitated for a moment before finally sitting down next to him. Her fair complexion was heating up, but she felt a bit happy inside.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her and earnestly spoke: “There are no noble or lowly bloodlines, at least, not in my eyes. For the rest of the world, many people believe they have noble bloodlines, but how many of them were ultimately stomped on by those with lowly bloodlines?”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Sitting next to him left her with an indescribable sense of satisfaction. His soft and charismatic voice was sweet music to her ears.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Qiye continued: “For ages, how many Immortal Emperors have been viewed by others as ones who possessed weak bloodlines? Not all of them had a noble upbringing. Even imperial children might lose to the common man.”</p>
 <p>“As long as you have a noble dao heart, you will be the one with the noble bloodline.” He elaborated: “Many peerless existences were proud not because of their bloodline, but because of their dao heart. Be righteous, confident, and determined — these traits are more precious than anything else.”</p>
 <p>“I, I heard that Young Noble, you have an imperial bloodline. In my eyes, you are nobler than anyone else.” Her eyes darted at him again. After saying this, she felt quite hot and bothered.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled in amusement and gently shook his head: “It doesn’t matter whether I have an imperial bloodline or not. All I need is my firm dao heart. With it, the entire world will be within my grasp. When I fail, I can still lift my head and break through all setbacks, becoming stronger than before. And even in success, I will not forget who I am. An indestructible dao heart will grant you eternality.”</p>
 <p>He earnestly told her: “Maintain a strong dao heart to be in control of everything.”</p>
 <p>“Well, of course, Young Noble, you are the true dragon of the nine heavens, victory will always be on your side.” She couldn’t help but praise him. In her eyes, Li Qiye was perfect. Embarrassment got the best of her again after her momentary lapse of emotions. She lowered her head once more.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye explained: “You can also become a phoenix that soars in the distant horizon as long as you are determined enough.”</p>
 <p>“Even, even someone like me?” Lin Miao’s mind trembled as if she had been struck by thunder. Becoming a phoenix was something she never dreamed about.</p>
 <p>His words swept through her mind like lightning, as if he was showing her the most beautiful light in this world.</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Li Qiye chuckled: “No one is born blessed or doomed. If your intentions are righteous, then you are noble! Countless people have risen against the heavens to change their fate. In the long river of time, some with humble beginnings left behind indelible marks.”</p>
 <p>He gave an example: “For instance, Empress Hong Tian. She was only an ordinary girl born in an era full of geniuses, she couldn’t be any more ordinary.”</p>
 <p>He paused for a bit before continuing: “But this ordinary girl surpassed countless difficulties. She laughed and cried but she never faltered. In the end, she trampled numerous geniuses and slew plenty of imperial princes. Her firm dao heart paved a path towards invincibility.”</p>
 <p>Lin Miao listened while looking at Li Qiye. She was fascinated by his ordinary features. This common appearance was incredibly attractive as if it was a spell. She could look at him forever without tiring. The same was true for his pleasant words; they were full of wisdom and charisma.</p>
 <p>“The empress’ motto was this: how can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan? She kept this in mind all her life, so she was named Hong Tian.” Li Qiye told Lin Miao: “You can also do this instead of thinking you are inferior to others just because of your bloodline.” [1. I learned something here. I used to think Hong Tian meant Grand Heaven, but after this explanation, Hong Tian is most likely describing a swan flying freely in the sky. Hong can mean swan/great/grand. I suppose her title would be Heavenswan or Skyswan instead of Grandheaven, if we were to translate this title to English.]</p>
 <p>Lin Miao was enchanted by this revelation. She eventually murmured: “How can the sparrow and swallow know the will of the great swan?”</p>
 <p>This single phrase illuminated her life and would bring about a new change. She saw unprecedentedly bright colors.</p>
 <p>This was an issue she didn’t ruminate in the past. In her eyes, the lake was large, but it couldn’t compare to sea god and Immortal Emperor lineages.</p>
 <p>She was only a common disciple from the lake. There were other senior brothers and sisters that were much more excellent in comparison. For example, her close friend Hong Yujiao was better than her in virtually every respect.</p>
 <p>Thus, her life would only be a bit eventful at best. It was impossible for her to join the ranks of Shangguan Feiyan or the legendary Seven Martial Goddess. This, on the other hand, gave her peace. Her pursuits weren’t overly ambitious and she was satisfied with just following her own pace and doing what she wanted to do.</p>
 <p>But now, Li Qiye’s words revealed a potential radiance never-before-seen in her life. It was a guiding beacon that she could follow.</p>
 <p>“Dreams exist where the mind is.” He smiled: “Back then, your lake’s four clans didn’t have the same resources as you do today. But in the end, they became an invincible legion. With great comradery, they swept through the battlefields with their children for the sake of their clans and left behind an indelible prestige.”</p>
 <p>He stared at her deeply and declared: “Your ancestors became something even stronger than an imperial legion not because of their unparalleled bloodline or incredible background, but because they had dao hearts that would never accept the word ‘defeat’.”</p>
 <p>Lin Miao emotionally palpitated. A feminine girl like her still felt her blood boiling when recalling the glory of past. She became momentarily dazed and suddenly, a dream took shape in her heart. She murmured: “Dreams exist where the mind is...”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. If you are willing, anything is possible.” Li Qiye encouraged: “The future of the younger generation is the future of the lake. No one else can control the fate of the lake other than all of you.”</p>
 <p>She secretly stole glances at Li Qiye several more times after calming down before quietly responding: “I, I don’t dream about becoming invincible like the ancestors. I just want to live a comfortable and happy life.” She was worried about what he would think of her answer and nervously lowered her head again.</p>
 <p>“As long as you keep on walking with great persistence and a goal, then all is fine. Whether you become invincible or not, leave that up to your fortune.” He continued: “But you must try to protect the lake. If you young ones don’t protect your own home, who will?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” She busily nodded, true to her thoughts. Right now, she felt that everything Li Qiye said was incredibly reasonable and wise.</p>
 <p>“Stick to it. Work hard and protect what you hold dear so that your lake can have a better future.” He showed a rare gentleness: “I will leave the lake to your generation, can do you it?”</p>
 <p>In the end, Li Qiye still wanted the best for the lake. Hong Tianzhu’s group was too old, so it was up to Lin Miao and her peers to take care of the lake in the future.</p>
 <p>The shy girl felt warmth and happiness. Li Qiye just said he wanted to entrust the lake to her. Just how much trust and hope was this?</p>
 <p>She eventually met his gaze and mustered courage out of nowhere to decisively answer: “I, I’ll listen to you.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1285: Departure</b></p>
 <p>While looking at her firm gaze, Li Qiye nodded and smiled: “I know you can definitely do it.”</p>
 <p>These words were spoken with credence. They gave her power like an immortal nectar and made her feel as if her body was floating among the clouds.</p>
 <p>Such simple words carried great influence and impact. They were more pleasant than anything else Lin Miao had heard before. Very shortly, she was overwhelmed with joy and felt something sweet like never before.</p>
 <p>“You are about to drool.” Li Qiye chuckled after seeing her dazed state.</p>
 <p>She regained her wits with a blush that spread to her neck, making her feel quite hot. Nevertheless, she was in a great mood due to the long lasting aftertaste.</p>
 <p>He smiled and concluded: “Go. One day, you shall soar through this world like a phoenix.”</p>
 <p>Her heart fluttered with jubilation. Even her steps felt lighter as she walked outside. Before leaving, she turned back and asked: “Will, will I see you again?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lamented in his mind after seeing her expression. This was an unfortunate feeling, but he still showed a smile and nodded: “If it is meant to be. If I am not in this world in the future, you can find me above the nine heavens.”</p>
 <p>“I got it.” She looked deeply at him, letting go of her shyness as if she wanted to carve his face and appearance deep in her mind to never forget them.</p>
 <p>After she left, he finally sighed and looked at the lake to say: “Emotions come and go, having no emotions is easier than otherwise. But how many could actually reach a true state of emotionlessness?”</p>
 <p>With that, he closed his eyes to enter a state of zen, no longer caring about external affairs.</p>
 <p>Several days later, Jian Longwei came to pick him up. Even if he didn’t, Li Qiye would leave the lake anyway.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei asked after seeing him: “Your Excellency, the divine dragon has sent word. The preparations are complete, will you leave right now?”</p>
 <p>“I should go today.” Li Qiye softly answered while looking at the lake through a window.</p>
 <p>Longwei asked: “You do not wish to stay a bit longer?” In fact, he was hoping that Li Qiye could stay at the Jian Clan for a short while.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye turned to look at him and smiled: “You have grown up to be quite excellent, I have nothing to teach you. As for your descendants, those who are capable will be personally taught by the old geezer. I won’t steal his thunder.”</p>
 <p>He went on: “I have met your ancestors and said my goodbyes. Lingering any further would only exacerbate my frustration.”</p>
 <p>The ancestors he mentioned were Jian Wendi and Jian Wenxin.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei nodded silently. He didn’t know much about the past, but he had heard something about Li Qiye and their ancestral aunt. [1. Aunt because Wendi is the progenitor.]</p>
 <p>“I’m very happy about how prosperous the Jian Clan has become.” Li Qiye smiled: “Even though humans are merely passersby in the Heaven Spirit World, this is not true for your clan, this is your home. As long as your progenitor and the older geezer are here as well as the mountain and the dragon kingdom, your clan shall stand strong.”</p>
 <p>“Our progenitor only wishes for his descendants to stay here.” Jian Longwei added: “I heard some ancestors wanted to open a separate branch in the Mortal Emperor World, but his venerable did not agree.”</p>
 <p>“This is where he belongs.” Li Qiye gently sighed: “Like many others, he has a deep affection and great love for this land; he’s more than willing to take root here in this life and the next.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye also understood that Jian Wendi still had a dao hurdle in his heart. This sister and brother duo couldn’t overcome this ridge in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Their father had hurt them too deeply, so those two would never want to return to the Mortal Emperor World. That was a land full of heart-wrenching pain, the place they experienced their most difficult years.</p>
 <p>Of course, Li Qiye could sympathize with their horrific past, so he never forced them to do anything.</p>
 <p>Longwei asked: “Your Excellency, where do you wish to go?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked up towards the far horizon in response: “The Bonesea. I’m finished with my business here, so it is time for me to leave.”</p>
 <p>“The Bonesea…” Longwei shuddered.</p>
 <p>The Bonesea was one of the twelve burial grounds, an extremely ominous location. As a taboo location of legends, even a Godking like him wouldn’t carelessly tread through it since it was a path of no return.</p>
 <p>Of course, he knew that for a supreme existence like Li Qiye, he could easily travel to any place as if it was flat ground.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and spoke: “I want to ask you something.”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, please go ahead.” Jian Longwei quickly bowed in response: “If this disciple knows about it, I will definitely let you know.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye paused for a moment before slowly asking: “How has the Celestial Pavilion been in the last two generations or so?” [2. The actual raw is Heavenly Immortal Pavilion, but the most common meaning behind the combination of Heavenly + Immortal is a goddess/fairy/beautiful women. It can also be used as a particular class of immortal, such as celestial/heavenly immortal or earth immortal. In this case, I’m refraining from using fairy and goddess because it isn’t the same word. Heavenly Immortal is just too long and it doesn’t fit the real meaning of both the word and context; immortal and heavenly has been used too much already. Celestial is a better choice.]</p>
 <p>Longwei was a bit surprised by this topic, but he hurriedly answered: “Your Excellency, the Celestial Pavilion is still holding strong as one of the most powerful lineages in the Heaven Spirit World. However, it has become increasingly reclusive, their disciples rarely show themselves.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye asked with sorrow: “Is the Lunargrasp Fairy still in this world?”</p>
 <p>This simple question startled Jian Longwei, but he answered right away: “Your Excellency, I heard the fairy is still in this world, but I have never seen her. After the divine dragon bestowed my title, I personally visited the Celestial Pavilion. The pavilion lord told me that she is still alive, but even the ancestors from their sect can’t seek an audience.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye internally bemoaned: “So many years...” He knew that he had to face certain things or it would forever be an unresolved knot.</p>
 <p>Longwei didn’t know the relationship between Li Qiye and the fairy. He quietly said: “The progenitor has said that the fairy is one of the strongest beings in Heaven Spirit right now. His Venerable himself felt that he couldn’t match up against her.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, she has always been that powerful. How could she not be?” Li Qiye sentimentally responded: “She was someone who competed against Empress Hong Tian for the Heaven’s Will and even defeated the empress many times when she was younger. She is indeed mighty.”</p>
 <p>“The progenitor also said that Heaven Spirit has the Lunargrasp Fairy while Mortal Emperor has South Emperor. Those two were the most gifted during that era.” Longwei found this topic quite interesting.</p>
 <p>Empress Hong Tian’s generation had geniuses coming out in droves. It could be considered a magnificent era.</p>
 <p>Immortal’s Legacy — these words were used to describe the Lunargrasp Fairy. One could easily imagine just how incredible her talents were from this title.</p>
 <p>“Their talents were indeed peerless during that era.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement and continued: “Even though there were as many geniuses as there were stars in the sky back then, they were still as dazzling as ever. However, South Emperor and the fairy were very different people. South Emperor was an elegant hermit while the fairy was an unyielding warrior.”</p>
 <p>Longwei was taken aback by this statement. Generally speaking, men were more prone to be considered warriors, but Li Qiye described the fairy as one. This made him wonder just how domineering she used to be.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Let’s go, it is now time.” He left the room afterward.</p>
 <p>Longwei busily kept up right behind him.</p>
 <p>Before his departure, Hong Tianzhu’s group showed up to bid farewell. They saw him all the way out of the lake.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye told the group: “Go back, even if you see a friend off for a thousand miles, you will still have to part in the end.”</p>
 <p>Hong Tianzhu and the others respectfully kneeled and worshipped him: “Young Noble, take care. May we meet again.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and took one last good look at the green Dongting Lake before flying to the sky with Jian Longwei.</p>
 <p>As he was leaving, Lin Miao mustered courage out of nowhere and shouted in his direction: “Young Noble, take care!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked back at her and revealed a faint smile before leaving with a nod.</p>
 <p>Lin Miao watched his departing figure in a trance. She eventually smiled, firmly engraving his image in the deepest part of her heart.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Tianzhu told Lin Miao: “Child, let’s go back.”</p>
 <p>As a senior, how could he not see it? He could only gently shake his head because Lin Miao and Li Qiye were people of different worlds. It might be too difficult for them to meet again in the future.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1286: Giant Dragon Mountain Range</b></p>
 <p>The Giant Dragon Mountain Range was shrouded in mist, so no one could see its true appearance. The word mysterious had always been its defining characteristic.</p>
 <p>Many wanted to enter in order to understand its nature, but they had always failed. Legend states that there was a kingdom in these mountains. No one knew whether this was true or not because none had visited it.</p>
 <p>Standing on top of a hill with an aura unique to this mountain range, Li Qiye looked over the undulating mountains. Once inside, one would find the area was completely different from its external appearance.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that vast continents were rare in Heaven Spirit. In fact, the only landmass considered to be a real continent was Godhalt.</p>
 <p>However, if one could enter the mountain range, they would find that the ground they stood on looked like a great continent comparable to Godhalt.</p>
 <p>Of course, few were privy to this scene. Even those who were qualified to enter would probably not tell outsiders about their experience.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled: “Giant Dragon Kingdom.” He found the kingdom a very interesting location.</p>
 <p>Of course, he didn’t plan to visit the Dragon Kingdom this time and had no desire to give those rascals there a beating.</p>
 <p>He gently shook his head and continued on his way. At this point, he was all by himself since Jian Longwei couldn’t follow him.</p>
 <p>He went quite deep into the mountain range through hills and deserts, after which he was met with a volcano and another ocean.</p>
 <p>It seemed that this place had formed its own realm as it was full of vast lands. With the absence of humans, a draconic aura permeated every corner of this place.</p>
 <p>For humans, being exposed to this aura would result in a very strong pressure. After all, dragons were mighty, so weak cultivators couldn’t withstand their auras.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, on the other hand, enjoyed basking in this aura. For him, it was too comfortable. This journey had been a pleasurable trip for him.</p>
 <p>“True dragons, the ultimate transformation of a demon dragon. Cleansing and refining their blood until it becomes the strongest and most precious bloodline in the world...” Li Qiye emotionally said: “The title of divine dragon is indeed apt.”</p>
 <p>Outsiders didn’t know that every inch of this mountain range was quite precious. It was a treasure land that allowed the future generations to prosper.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye murmured: “This bloodline is quite exquisite. The old geezer’s choice was truly wise. Otherwise, they would definitely become feasts for the emperors and gods above the nine heavens.”</p>
 <p>The old geezer’s offspring were powerful because they had inherited his bloodline. Of course,, they were far inferior to the old man himself. Nevertheless, a thick bloodline of a true dragon coursed through their veins.</p>
 <p>In the outside world existed very diluted true dragon bloodlines. If the old geezer’s descendants were outside, others would consider them as true dragons.</p>
 <p>For their race, their precious bloodline was both a blessing and a curse. It was needless to mention the advantages, they were destined to be powerful. The disadvantages were clear as well; because their bloodline was so strong, it was difficult for them to reproduce.</p>
 <p>It could be said that in Heaven Spirit or even the entire nine worlds, no other race had such a difficult time reproducing as the dragons. Fortunately, their lifespans were relatively long, or else they would have become extinct long ago.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the geezer needed the Jian Clan because only their imperial bloodline was worthy of their race. Moreover, both sides had a relationship thicker than blood. The old geezer trusted the Jian Clan; this played a great part in why the Jian Clan was the only lineage in Heaven Spirit that could stay in Rainbow City.</p>
 <p>In fact, the other four clans of Dongting Lake had deep ties with the dragon mountain as well. However, this was a matter of long ago.</p>
 <p>The other issue with their bloodline was that, through cultivation, they could reach atavism and cause their blood to become even purer.</p>
 <p>This, in turn, made them hesitant to compete against the rest of the world. The reason was that once a member of their race becomes an Immortal Emperor, they would have to face the world inhabited by gods and emperors.</p>
 <p>Just imagine, their precious bloodline would become a nutritious feast, a high-level liquid for life-prolongment.</p>
 <p>They would only become prey in such a place. It was very difficult for their tribe to establish a stronghold under such circumstances. This was why the old man’s race chose to be reclusive and stay unknown to outsiders.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye eventually reached his destination after a long trek. This was a barren land with only loess in sight. Eventually, he stood before an ordinary looking hill and heard clanking gallops from a horse.</p>
 <p>He smiled right away and approached the stone wall. There was an entrance to a cavern at its base. It looked normal, but there was a fence seemingly made from white ivory.</p>
 <p>A skeletal horse was pacing back and forth in front of this entrance as if it was waiting for something. This was the very horse that appeared in the ocean in the past, the mount of Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Who would have thought that it would be here?</p>
 <p>Of course, it was given permission by the old geezer. Otherwise, even an emperor’s mount wouldn’t have been able to reach this location.</p>
 <p>“Neigh—” It roared after seeing Li Qiye and aggressively lifted its frontal hooves. This was clearly an antagonistic posture.</p>
 <p>It couldn’t be blamed. Li Qiye had transformed into the young emperor in order to trick it. From its perspective, he was an enemy.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “There’s no need to be so hostile towards me. Maybe you will ask me for help in just a bit. At that time, it would be too late if you try to suck up to me, right?”</p>
 <p>“Neigh—” Despite being mere bones, it still had a great amount of spirituality, so it could understand Li Qiye. As a result, it didn’t attack him despite its hostile behavior.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stood before the entrance and took a look before praising: “This place is pretty well sealed. Once locked inside, not only can it evade everything, nothing can come out either.”</p>
 <p>There was a great mystery behind this cavern. Just the fence that sealed it was made from heaven-defying dragon bones from the geezer himself! Its power was unimaginable.</p>
 <p>There was not much in the cave itself outside of a cage inside a pit on the ground that was completely inserted into the earth.</p>
 <p>The pit itself was filled with an extremely black liquid. There might not be something darker than this liquid in this world. It could absorb all light, including the rays of the sun. There was no escape after being devoured.</p>
 <p>At a first glance, someone would actually mistake it for a black hole. It was not an inanimate object either. Occasionally, it would slightly creep around. A full range of motion was impossible because it was in the pit. At the very least, it seemed to be alive.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was all smiles after seeing this liquid as he murmured: “That old geezer really risked it back then, to actually lock this thing down here. Who else in this world could actually accomplish this?”</p>
 <p>This stygian liquid was brought back by the old man from the Bonesea. It had a frightening origin. The old man sealed it here for his own use, but he never got around to using it.</p>
 <p>It didn’t look particularly conspicuous, but if people knew of its usefulness, they would break heads vying for it. Even Immortal Emperors would bring treasures here to make a deal with him.</p>
 <p>His eyes then shifted towards a corner of this cave. There was an object there.</p>
 <p>To be exact, it was two items — a pair of eyes. These eyes seemed to be casually placed in the corner as if they had been abandoned.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1287: A Pair Of Eyes</b></p>
 <p>These eyes seemed to be quite archaic, as if they were plucked out from a living being and left in this corner long ago.</p>
 <p>They were well-preserved in this place, not at all withered by the passage of time.</p>
 <p>They suddenly lit up at this very moment. Prior to this, they seemed to be closed, but now, they were opening. The eyes suddenly shifted, not in a tumbling sense, but the gaze seemed to be rotating in a very bizarre manner. Anyone would be frightened by this weird scene.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but grin. He understood something after seeing it and said: “Bu Si, you brat. It looks like you hid your eyes in this place. You must have paid a great price to do so.”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the world knew about the collapse and destruction of Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Who would have thought that he had left his pair of eyes in this eternally secluded location, capable of evading everything and anything?</p>
 <p>“Geezer, let’s do it.” Li Qiye touched the fence made from dragon bones and looked to the sky with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Squeak—” A heavy sound came about. At this time, the fence slowly rose to the sky and the cavern was made available to Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Neigh—” The horse was especially excited to see the seal being removed and lifted its hooves up high. It had been waiting for this moment and quickly rushed for the cavern in order to take the pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>However, it immediately stopped and slowly retreated to the entrance. Despite being all bones, it could tell that the black liquid inside the cage was quite dreadful.</p>
 <p>“Neigh—” The horse raised its hooves again and stared helplessly at the eyes in the corner.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled when he saw the horse’s appearance and leisurely asked: “Do you need my help now?”</p>
 <p>The frustrated horse looked back at Li Qiye. It still had the same hostility as before.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye noticed this but didn't care too much. He shrugged and continued with a smile: “You can hate me or whatever, I won’t mind since I am such a benevolent person. However, what can you do in this situation? Will you continue to act hostile, or will you let it go and ask me for help?”</p>
 <p>The horse glanced between Li Qiye and the eyes in the corner. With another neigh, it seemed to agree with Li Qiye. Despite this being the case, there was still a trace of caution in its demeanor.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled: “Don’t look at me like that. If I really wanted to take you down, you wouldn’t be standing here right now. Your background might be incredible, but I could have pinned you to the ground long ago.”</p>
 <p>“Neigh—” The horse roared again as if it found this reply displeasing. Nevertheless, its hostility had been greatly reduced.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye grinned and revealed: “My demand isn’t high for helping you get those eyes. I just want to ride you for a bit later on, I believe this is quite fair.”</p>
 <p>The horse tilted its skull while contemplating. It resembled a human more than a skeletal horse.</p>
 <p>In its eyes, Li Qiye was not a nice person at all. Its sentient self remained very cautious towards him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and added: “Okay, what other choice do you have if you refuse?”</p>
 <p>The horse let out another neigh before nodding its head. Without a doubt, it had accepted the condition.</p>
 <p>“Very well, now that’s a good horsey.” Li Qiye satisfyingly beamed and reached out to pat the horse’s head.</p>
 <p>It still didn’t completely accept Li Qiye, so it shook its head to get his hand off. Li Qiye’s smile disappeared as he withdrew his hand and then proceeded to enter the cavern. He went to the corner and picked up the pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>He didn’t immediately give it to the horse and instead carefully inspected it. The eyes met his stare with a curious glance as they darted about like the inquisitive eyes of a baby.</p>
 <p>After a careful examination, Li Qiye couldn’t help but smirk: “Immortal Emperor Bu Si, it looks like you still have an opportunity to turn things around. Brat, you are indeed full of schemes, to actually come up with something like this.”</p>
 <p>The eyes didn’t understand what Li Qiye was saying. They looked like they weren’t only curious about Li Qiye, they wanted to find out everything about the outside world.</p>
 <p>“For generations, no one has been successful, but you have actually done it, not bad at all.” Li Qiye grinned while looking at the eyes: “Fine, I’ll lend you a hand. I will help you open your eyes.”</p>
 <p>With that, universal laws formed in his palm and rippled like the surface of a lake. He further derived these laws to expose their boundless potential and pointed at the pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>“Neigh!” The skeletal horse by the entrance grew nervous and loudly howled. It wanted to rush in several times, but the black liquid truly frightened it. It was afraid that Li Qiye was doing something unfavorable to the eyes.</p>
 <p>“Buzz—” When Li Qiye’s finger touched the eyes, the boundless laws instantly jumped into them. At this point, a new world seemed to be opening in these eyes. This world was filled with color and swelling water — a magnificent scene.</p>
 <p>Inside the eyes, a sun rose while a moon fell. A great sky emerged with winds and clouds. Generations changed from one to the next with continuous transformations between prosperity and stagnation… A grand universe was floating up and down within them.</p>
 <p>The tense horse finally became relieved after seeing this. It had misunderstood Li Qiye; he was helping the eyes instead of harming them.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the pair of eyes, full of curiosity, looked at the universe within. Everything seemed to be new and full of surprises.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye then took it out of the cavern and looked at the horse while smiling: “If I wanted to harm them, would I have bothered to make a deal with you?” Having said that, he put the eyes into the horse’s eye sockets.</p>
 <p>“Neigh!” The horse excitedly roared. It took several steps backward to slowly adapt to its new eyes.</p>
 <p>The truth was that this scene was incredibly bizarre. A horse comprised of only bones had gained a pair of human eyes — anyone would be creeped out after seeing this.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored the horse and entered the cave again. With runes in his palm, he carved them on the cage and then lifted it up: “Open!”</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The other half of the cage under the ground was slowly being lifted by Li Qiye. Eventually, the whole cage was lifted up.</p>
 <p>The black liquid in the pit began to stir in the midst of this process. It seemed as if Mt. Tai, a weight of trillions of pounds, had been removed from its body.</p>
 <p>It stretched out a bit and slowly streamed out from the pit. A more accurate description would be that it was crawling out from its imprisonment.</p>
 <p>“Neigh!” The horse was very afraid while watching this. It retreated to maintain a certain distance from this liquid.</p>
 <p>The liquid cheered after finding out that it was finally free. Even though no sound came out, its shape and form made its jubilation apparent.</p>
 <p>Just like that, it darted out of the hole like a gust of wind; it was excited to see the sun again.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1288: Item Left Behind</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye followed the liquid out of the cave. After seeing the sun, the liquid found itself free and happily soared into the sky. Shortly after, a black ray short towards the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and patted the horse: “Go, follow right behind it. This will make it easier for you to enter the forbidden zones in the Bonesea.”</p>
 <p>“Neigh!” The skeletal horse let out a roar and raised its frontal hooves before leaping into the sky. It disappeared in the black liquid’s direction.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye murmured after seeing this: “Brat, I hope you can do it. It will definitely be a miracle. But of course, your current self is already a miracle.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was not in a hurry to chase after the horse and the black liquid. He took his time leaving the mountain range.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei was already waiting outside for him with a wooden box in his hands.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei looked towards the Bonesea’s direction and curiously asked: “Is the Bonesea about to emerge?”</p>
 <p>“It’ll be lively for some time at the western Bonesea. Many people who have been coveting items from there won’t be able to sit still.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the horizon.</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei didn’t comment. Even though the items there might be precious, he wanted nothing to do with them. Plus, this was a different generation; he didn’t want to leave Rainbow City at all.</p>
 <p>He calmed down and respectfully raised the wooden box towards Li Qiye with both hands: “Your Excellency, the progenitor wanted me to give you this. He said that this is something our ancestral aunt left behind; it is related to Empress Hong Tian. The ancestral aunt gave this to the progenitor before passing away, but he didn’t know when to give it to you. He said that this might be your last time visiting our Jian Clan and perhaps your last meeting, so he ordered me to give it to you.” The ancestral aunt was Jian Wenxin.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye accepted the box and opened it to take a look inside. After a while, he gently closed it and sighed.</p>
 <p>“It is all in the past.” He put the box away and spoke with a hint of sadness: “I had already let go of this matter back then and didn’t blame anyone. Immortality… perhaps I was wrong…”</p>
 <p>Jian Longwei hesitated for a moment before stating: “The progenitor said that before she passed away, she also hoped that you could forget about the issue with Empress Hong Tian…”</p>
 <p>“You don’t know Empress Hong Tian, and Wenxin didn’t either.” Li Qiye smiled and gently shook his head: “I’m not blaming her for it. She has always been incredibly stubborn, but I don’t want her to change. Pride is part of her nature, her stubbornness is actually a little adorable…”</p>
 <p>He recalled the olden days with the stubborn girl and couldn’t help but smile.</p>
 <p>Even though they got into quite a fight and went their separate ways despite their complete trust in each other, Li Qiye had never blamed her.</p>
 <p>Longwei was quiet since he didn’t know too much about his predecessors. Sometimes, he heard his progenitor talk about the relationship between the Dark Crow, Empress Hong Tian, and the ancestral aunt. It was too complicated for outsiders to understand.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye glanced at Longwei and said: “Your Jian Clan can co-exist with the dragon kingdom, so I’m not worried at all. You are the lord of the clan, but I don’t have any good advice for you. Just keep trying your best and continue to pass down your bloodline. It hasn’t been easy for the clan to last this long; your progenitor has spent a miraculous amount of effort. This is also the reason why he has been hanging on to dear life all this time…”</p>
 <p>“... He is too reluctant to leave his descendants for he is full of love. His aspiration is to protect those children forever, to give them a peaceful life. He loves you all and this land wholeheartedly. His reason for living is not something personal, it isn’t because he fears death. It’s because he can’t bear to leave, there are too many things in this world that make him worry.” He gently sighed at the end.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi’s life experience only bolstered his self-perceived responsibility for his children. He didn’t want to be like his father who abandoned his own children for a selfish cause.</p>
 <p>Jian Wendi was willing to do everything for his descendants. He was a good father and a proper ancestor, trying to protect his descendants for generations to come.</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, I will keep your words deep in my mind.” Longwei bowed with great reverence.</p>
 <p>“I have to go now.” Li Qiye looked back at the mountain range with yearning sentiments. Then, he casually pointed forward to open a portal and quickly crossed through many territories.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>In recent days, there had been sudden changes at the Dragon Demon Sea. A black star came out of nowhere and crossed the sky with great speed like a falling meteor. Because it was too swift, the void shattered and issued bursts of explosions.</p>
 <p>This meteor was followed by a skeletal horse whose speed was no lesser than the star itself. The horse continued to maintain a certain distance behind this meteor. This bizarre scene attracted the attention of many cultivators in this region.</p>
 <p>What was even more concerning was that when this meteor crossed the sky, the skeletons in the nearby vicinity would begin to move. Some of them seemed to have been granted life and began to crawl.</p>
 <p>However, after the meteor disappeared over the horizon, the skeletons would lose their strength and fall apart once more, scattering all over the ground.</p>
 <p>This was quite a creepy spectacle and frightened all the nearby cultivators. Some experts and even seclusive ancestors had no choice but to pay attention to this event. Many speculations and theories arose.</p>
 <p>“Maybe this is a demon star that will bring about a calamity to the Dragon Demon Sea. After all, only a devilish star such as this would be able to revive the dead.” Plenty of big shots were worried.</p>
 <p>Of course, a few ancestors were ecstatic. Their eyes flashed after seeing the moving skeletons powered by the star, and some even murmured: “This star can revive skeletons. Perhaps there is an immortal item within that will allow people to become eternal!”</p>
 <p>In fact, many ancestors reached this conclusion. For those on the verge of death like them, nothing was more tempting than eternal life. The appearance of this black star gave them hope.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, the ancestors of many sea god and imperial lineages came out one after another. They thought about pursuing this black star.</p>
 <p>Soon, news regarding the location of this star was spread. Someone personally saw it fly into the Bonesea with a skeletal horse right behind it.</p>
 <p>“Into the Bonesea?” A big character murmured while his eyes sparkled: “Does the Bonesea really have an item that grants immortality?”</p>
 <p>Another answered: “Maybe this is the case.”</p>
 <p>After coming up with this possibility, these ancestors became unbelievably excited, like chickens with their heads cut off. They all excitedly stated: “There are so many tempting items in there. It looks like the momentum of the age is about to change, an item that can grant immortality is about to appear.”</p>
 <p>“An immortal artifact is coming into being at the Bonesea!” Someone released this news to the entire region.</p>
 <p>An item that could grant immortality was mouth-watering. Many ancestors would be driven even crazier with such a thing. This news turned into a storm that swept up all the experts nearby. Heaven Spirit itself was affected. The powerful inhabitants of the Abyss and Jade Seas immediately departed for the Dragon Demon Sea and headed straight for the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>Even the rare existences that had been buried under the earth since the dawn of time were startled after hearing this news.</p>
 <p>An ancient existence calmed down and murmured: “Who is the mastermind?”</p>
 <p>Even though this particular existence didn’t know the real mysteries behind the Bonesea, they had heard stories about it, legends, even.</p>
 <p>They immediately understood that there was a puppet master behind all of this. However, the exact reason for these events eluded them.</p>
 <p>This was precisely why these near-death existences didn’t want to come into being even after hearing about this immortal artifact. Whether it was real or not, they didn’t dare to be involved.</p>
 <p>Only truly powerful existences like them understood that very few in this world would dare to concoct such a plan.</p>
 <p>This was a level beyond them, an even more fearsome type of existence that belonged only in legends. Despite being unstoppable for so long, they were unwilling to mess with such an existence because it might bring extinction to their race.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1289: Rootless Duckweed</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye left the dragon mountains for the Bonesea. He wasn’t in a hurry, so he opened his portals randomly while crossing through the countries.</p>
 <p>He stopped multiple times along the way to bask in the beautiful sceneries of the Dragon Demon Sea. After all, these majestic scenes were unique to Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>He had heard about the immortal artifact coming out of the Bonesea and only smiled in response.</p>
 <p>Seeing people anxiously running there didn’t affect his pace because he knew that the time was not ripe. Only when it was would he finally be able to reach his desired destination. Otherwise, it would all be in vain.</p>
 <p>Because of this, he relaxed and took his time traveling across this beautiful sea region. However, he would occasionally become absent-minded in front of this beauty. While standing on a cliff and gazing at the vast sea, his mind seemed to drift away.</p>
 <p>In those distant years, there was a period of time when he had a taste of the happiness of being an ordinary man. During an evening on this very cliff, there was someone who held hands with him while watching the sunset.</p>
 <p>He continued to look at the sun slowly sinking into the sea in a stupor. After a long time, he withdrew his gaze and gave a carefree smile: “Yueli, I’ll let you know that someone named Li Qiye is back. I don’t mind even if you kill me. All debts must be repaid before I go to the final world.”</p>
 <p>With that, he laughed with an open mind before coolly leaving. Sometimes he would fly or ride the waves.</p>
 <p>Among the billowing clouds were a few mountains and old pavilions. This scene looked just like an immortal paradise. Among these hidden mountains were lush, ancient pines and gurgling streams.</p>
 <p>In the pavilions were cultivators absorbing and releasing the elements as if they were immortals.</p>
 <p>When standing in these clouds, one would often see other cultivators traveling. When they met, it was a time to be cheerful and enthusiastic. Honorifics were thrown and greetings were exchanged. They would explore the arts of the elements.</p>
 <p>These scenes looked particularly beautiful, but the truth was far from this. Behind these dream-like images was an unimaginable cruelty.</p>
 <p>These cultivators hiding in the clouds belonged to the human race. Moreover, their situation was one of helplessness.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Spirit World, continents were far and few between; most landmasses already had masters. Cultivators didn’t mind being in oceans. At a certain level, there was virtually no difference between land and water. However, humans were land creatures. More often than not, they weren't suited for the sea, unlike the sea tribes who had a love for the oceans and were born there.</p>
 <p>Some human cultivators had no territory, so they had to stay in the sky and hide in the clouds. These mountains and pavilions weren’t personally refined by them but instead were left behind by their ancestors. Of course, the lucky ones could come across places without an owner.</p>
 <p>The abandoned mountains and pavilions were often lineages that failed to be passed down. Their final generation must have died from old age. Thus, the structures could only float in the clouds across the vast firmament. The lucky ones could then claim these as their own.</p>
 <p>When human cultivators reached a certain power level and didn’t have a landmass, they would dig out mud and soil from the ocean or move a mountain in order to refine them. This process would eventually turn into these artificial creations floating among the clouds in the sky.</p>
 <p>The truth was that it wasn’t their choice. Who would want to drift endlessly in the sky if they had their own land?</p>
 <p>For some people, this style of life was very interesting and fun at the start. However, as time passed, they would come to find that they were not the masters of their own destiny.</p>
 <p>Given the choice between having a home and this, no one would want to be rootless duckweed. Moreover, it was dangerous to drift around like this. Once they met an enemy who was more powerful than themselves, they could be destroyed at any time.</p>
 <p>This dreamy life was the result of a lack of choice. In this kind of rootless drifting, one wouldn’t have any way of establishing an ancestral ground, mining resources, or planting precious elixirs and plants.</p>
 <p>Being poor was a fatal disadvantage for cultivators. A wealth of resources was crucial for cultivators and sects to grow stronger.</p>
 <p>However, having an abundance of these resources relied on having one’s own territory in order to keep them safe. It was often meaningless to have too many resources while participating in this vagabond lifestyle. Having a pavilion in the air was simply a fool’s dream.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head while looking at a few of the cultivators visiting and talking to each other among these mountains and pavilions in the middle of this sea of clouds.</p>
 <p>In this helpless situation, these humans could only rely on each other for support. Otherwise, they would be easily washed away by the flood.</p>
 <p>“This simply cannot be a place for humans to live.” This was Li Qiye’s only comment.</p>
 <p>How many could be lucky enough to have their own landmass like the Exquisite Valley or Dongting Lake? Very few could enjoy being born into such a great background. To be able to join those sects was also a type of fortune.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, he didn’t feel too sad about it. In his eyes, everyone had their own path. Even a savior couldn’t save everyone.</p>
 <p>He went on his way, riding the ocean waves without a care.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, where are you going? Do you want my company?” A pleasant voice rang with a hint of allurement that could stir the heart.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced over and saw Liu Ruyan standing on a boat. She was basking in the breeze with her slender figure like a willow leaf, making others truly get a sense for the fluttering wind.</p>
 <p>She was riding a gigantic ship with the symbol of the Void Imperfection Three Schools on it. In Heaven Spirit, everyone would show some respect for this symbol.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and got on the ship instead of refusing.</p>
 <p>She showed warm hospitality by moving a table over before proceeding to light some sandalwood scents. Next, she boiled tea and personally handed it to him.</p>
 <p>He didn’t seem to mind the gesture and casually lied down by the table, looking quite comfortable.</p>
 <p>She smiled and handed him a teacup while saying: “Young Noble, my craft is not as good as my sister’s, please don’t laugh.”</p>
 <p>Though her face was hidden behind a thin veil, each of her frowns and smiles exuded a special and comforting charm.</p>
 <p>Gongsun Meiyu was also an enchanting person, but her charm was different. Meiyu had the mature allure of a married woman. Her charm relied on her beauty and her beauty relied on a sense of lust.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ruyan’s charm was much more refined. It seeped into the heart with a touch of elegance and youthfulness. Such a woman was to be adored by all men.</p>
 <p>He accepted the tea and slowly took a sip while staring at her without saying anything.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, are you going to the Bonesea?” She showed a smile that would make hearts flutter: “I’m also going to the Bonesea, may I accompany you?”</p>
 <p>He responded while faintly grinning: “You are well-informed.”</p>
 <p>She frankly said: “Young Noble, you are a dragon among men, a supreme prodigy. Many eyes are on you regardless of the time or place as you’re just like a swan among a flock of chickens. Your location can easily be found by asking around a bit.”</p>
 <p>“Little beauty, I don’t care what your plan is, but don’t provoke me or I might just avail myself of your charm.” Li Qiye was in a particularly good mood while looking at this attractive woman.</p>
 <p>“Do you actually dare?” Ruyan responded with a teasing chuckle: “There’s no need for you to do so. If you want, I am more than willing to join you in bed. Of course, if you have some unusual tastes, I can also entertain you in that manner.”</p>
 <p>Such words truly pulled on one’s heartstrings and made blood boil, especially when they came from someone as devilishly lovely as Liu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Well said!” Li Qiye’s eyes widened as he suddenly pulled her closer in an overbearing manner. She couldn’t respond in time for he was too fast in taking her into his embrace.</p>
 <p>“Pa! Pa! Pa!” A series of slaps resounded. Liu Ruyan cried out in surprise as Li Qiye slapped her sweet buttocks repeatedly.</p>
 <p>He showed no sign of mercy for the fairer sex and used great force on her soft and pretty behind. She was definitely feeling a burning pain!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1290: Martial Sisters</b></p>
 <p>“You!” Liu Ruyan resembled a cat that had its tail stepped on, instantly jumping back. She glared at Li Qiye with both fear and embarrassment. Even though her speech was bold, innocence was still part of her nature.</p>
 <p>What frustrated her even more was that Li Qiye showed no mercy at all. Her butt was burning with pain, especially if she sat down.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat back and glanced at the girl to say: “I’m not someone you can tease as you please. I’ll even strip you for a public display, what do you say about that?”</p>
 <p>She gave him a fierce look and angrily replied: “Do you not know how to be a gentleman at all?”</p>
 <p>As the Evil Devourer Schoolmaster, she enjoyed a high position in the Heaven Spirit World. Moreover, she herself was enchantingly beautiful, enough so to sway the soul of any man. It could be said that she was a demoness at the level of a calamity, a moon surrounded by the stars in the eyes of men.</p>
 <p>No man had ever been this rude to her, but today, Li Qiye was both rude and unmerciful.</p>
 <p>“Gentleman?” He smiled, revealing his perfectly white teeth: “Of course I know how to be a gentleman, but that depends on who I’m dealing with.”</p>
 <p>Despite her frustration, there was nothing she could do about it. She was aware of his notoriety from having killed beauties like Gongsun Meiyu and Shangguan Feiyan without any mercy at all. It was no longer surprising for this fierce man to do whatever he wished.</p>
 <p>She sat back down but felt a stinging pain, causing her to frown.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile after seeing her expression: “It looks like I was a bit too rough.”</p>
 <p>The remark sounded quite sarcastic.</p>
 <p>“It’s good that you are aware.” She glared at him again without losing any of her charm.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be enjoying her presence, evident by his smile. This, in turn, made her embarrassed as shown by her giving him the side-eye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored her stare and took his time enjoying the tea before speaking: “This tea from your Evil Devourer School is quite good, but to be honest, your charming demeanor is even better than this tea.”</p>
 <p>Who knows if this remark was meant as praise or mockery. Meanwhile, she elegantly poured a full cup of tea for him, rendering a very pleasurable scene.</p>
 <p>She sat there quietly as he drank the tea. Although she was still, she exuded a different style of attractiveness.</p>
 <p>After finishing the cup, he looked at her and cheerfully asked: “What do you want?”</p>
 <p>She poured another cup for him in a very comforting style and revealed a smile that would cause the body to go soft: “To steal my senior sister’s man, is that alright? All the elders in the sect want her to bear your child in order to spread your bloodline.”</p>
 <p>“All because of the imperial bloodline?” He couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
 <p>She playfully smirked and blinked her eyes: “I heard that outside of our progenitor, no one else from our school was able to become a true whale rider. If your bloodline is passed down, we might gain a new rider.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled in response. He understood this very well since their schools didn’t only want an imperial bloodline, these ancestors sought another whale rider.</p>
 <p>After a while, Li Qiye changed the topic: “I heard your sister had married.”</p>
 <p>She replied: “I am different from her. She always placed the school first to the point of sacrificing herself. However, she is also the ideal wife in the minds of men. Elegant, noble, sensible, understanding, wise but not overbearing... which man wouldn’t like her?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye teased: “Aren’t you jealous?”</p>
 <p>She chuckled in response: “Why would I be? She has her path and I have mine. Instead of being a virtuous wife like her, I prefer to be rebellious. The path of the grand dao is arduous. It isn’t easy being a cultivator, so why should anyone burden themselves with so many responsibilities? Be free and true to your desires, that’s how it should be.”</p>
 <p>He was amused by her answer as he looked at her. She felt no apprehension under his stare and instead met it directly.</p>
 <p>“Be free and true to your desires, well said.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.</p>
 <p>“I might not be a proper schoolmaster, but I’m definitely a proper cultivator.” She smiled.</p>
 <p>“Of course, you can reconsider.” She playfully winked: “I heard some men have a particular penchant for married women. The more powerful they are, the more unimaginable their tastes are. Even though my sister was a married woman, she is still a virgin and absolutely suitable for you.”</p>
 <p>“I’m fully aware of what kind of woman is suitable for me.” He smiled in response: “Your so-called competing against your sister is only a facade for you to help her.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” She winked once more and provocatively smiled while lightheartedly saying: “Not necessarily, a man like you is very attractive, enough to fascinate young girls. It isn’t strange for me to compete against her.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” He leisurely replied: “If the old men from your schools want something from me, fine, I’ll fulfill their wish. If both your sister and yourself warm my bed, I will consider it.”</p>
 <p>“Wow, Young Noble, you have quite an appetite, wanting to hit two swans with one arrow... Holding beauties from both sides to fully enjoy the pleasure of men.” She smiled: “That’s quite an ambition you have there.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye faintly smiled: “I said I’m only reconsidering. The one losing out in this deal is me.”</p>
 <p>She took another glance at this nonchalant man ahead of her and sentimentally sighed: “A confident man is so attractive, you’re truly swaying my heart.”</p>
 <p>“Alright little beauty, there’s no need to goad me.” Li Qiye said: “Let your senior sister come out, your tricks aren’t fooling anyone.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Zhuo Jianshi emerged from within the boat. She bowed before him and sincerely said: “Excuse us again. If we have done anything foolish, please punish us.”</p>
 <p>Her attitude was very sincere as she maintained a very low posture. Nevertheless, she was still incredibly elegant and had a hint of sexiness. It was quite difficult to not like someone such as her, especially when her soft and silky voice entered one’s ears; they would feel quite comfortable upon hearing her voice.</p>
 <p>“Well, I’m not from your school, so there’s no need for this type of formality and punishment.” He gently waved his sleeve.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you are discerning with matchless wisdom, nothing can elude you.” Liu Ruyan smiled: “But this isn’t my sister’s fault. It was my idea, so if you want to blame someone, blame me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only looked at the two of them since he didn’t really mind: “Even your three schools do not make exceptions for you two?”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi was hesitant to respond as she was unsure how to phrase it. In the end, she chose to stay silent.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan movingly smiled instead: “It can’t be helped. At times, cultivators are unable to escape their responsibilities. If you don’t mind, how about leaving your bloodline with us? It will be a meritorious deed.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the two and smiled: “Who will be waiting first? Or will both of you come together?”</p>
 <p>Such directness left Jianshi feeling hot. Even though the upper echelons of the schools wished for this, she was still a girl, so she inevitably became embarrassed when faced with this problem.</p>
 <p>Ruyan fared better as she was still smiling: “It is okay if you want to have both of us.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lightly laughed before answering: “Forget it, there’s no need to talk about this matter. Go back and tell the old geezers to give up on this idea. I won’t casually have children or leave behind my bloodline for your schools.”</p>
 <p>With that, he stood up, intending to leave.</p>
 <p>Jianshi softly sighed after hearing this response. What could she do about it? She understood that a man like Li Qiye wasn’t so easily tempted by women.</p>
 <p>“If you are going to the Bonesea, why don’t we go together?” Ruyan chuckled: “Or are you afraid of being seduced by our charm so you don’t dare to be close to us?”</p>
 <p>“Really now?” He looked at her and actually sat back down: “Fine, I want to see just what kind of charm the two of you possess.”</p>
 <p>He naturally knew that this was her way of goading him, but he still stayed in the end.</p>
 <p>She boldly told Jianshi: “Big Sis, since Young Noble is staying, shouldn’t we be offering our services like giving him a massage?”</p>
 <p>Jianshi instantly turned red. Even though she had agreed with the ancestors in the sect and was prepared to sacrifice herself, this was still her first time serving a man.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1291: Two Beauties In Waiting</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye was pleasantly occupied while staring at the elegant and bashful Jianshi. He leisurely said: “Okay, come give me a shoulder massage.”</p>
 <p>She hesitated for a moment before moving behind him to give him a massage. This was a first for her, so her actions were quite jerky. Nevertheless, a touch as gentle as water still left room for enjoyment.</p>
 <p>Ruyan smiled and poured more tea for Li Qiye with a smooth, flowing style that was quite beautiful.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the gentle Jianshi and then the seductive Ruyan before commenting with emotion: “To tell the truth, I’m a bit envious of your Void Imperfection Schools. No matter the situation, it is always of the same heart. Despite being divided into three schools, the disciples have unusual solidarity. This is definitely a rare matter.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, your remark is mistaken.” Ruyan chuckled: “Even though I’m helping her right now, discord and competition plagued our youth.”</p>
 <p>He faintly smiled: “Is that so?”</p>
 <p>In fact, the school wanted Jianshi to keep Li Qiye back. Even though she was the main actor and Ruyan was the assistant, the two of them still had a great relationship. Even though they had conflicting views at times and competed against each other, they were still martial sisters who loved each other. Minor things like arguing and fighting didn’t affect their true relationship.</p>
 <p>For instance, right now. Jianshi was a wise and elegant woman, but she was still very inexperienced and lacked the boldness overflowing in Ruyan. The latter was the one who could help her keep Li Qiye back.</p>
 <p>“Competition is a good thing. A sect without competition will stagnate. Competition on top of great comradery, nothing is more precious than this.” Li Qiye enjoyed the massage and commented: “Your ancestors did a good job of passing down such a big lineage. It would be difficult for a sect with these characteristics to not last for a long time. Regardless of the era, your sect has always been an enviable existence.”</p>
 <p>He was only stating the truth. Among the powerful lineages in the Heaven Spirit World, the three schools rarely showed themselves. However, they didn’t weaken, their strength remained a deterrence against the rest of the lineages.</p>
 <p>Jianshi softly spoke while massaging Li Qiye: “Young Noble, if you will it, the Void Imperfection School will be yours.” Her words were gentle like water, making others want to drown in them.</p>
 <p>“Are you really willing?” He looked up to meet her countenance only inches away and smiled.</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t deceive you.” She hesitated for a moment then met his gaze with her limpid autumn water eyes: “In the past, I really didn’t want to marry you, but after interacting with you more, this marriage wouldn’t be insulting to me at all. In fact, I would be the one reaching above my post.”</p>
 <p>“People from the Void Imperfection School are indeed wise.” Li Qiye smiled but shook his head: “Void Imperfection has its own fate while I have mine. If your ancestor was still in this world, I’m afraid she wouldn’t want to see it tied to my war chariot, so forget about this matter.”</p>
 <p>Anyone else would be excited to no end after hearing about the possibility of grasping this great authority. At that point, beauties and power would come too easily. Who wouldn’t desire these things?</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye didn’t care for it since it wasn’t what he desired, even though Void Imperfection would give him plenty.</p>
 <p>Plus, he didn’t want to involve the school in his personal goals. Even though Immortal Emperor Wu Gou wasn’t his student, the emperor still respected him. Because of this, he was even more hesitant to break the school’s serenity. [1. The author used “she” earlier, so this is a female Immortal Emperor, but until it is explicitly stated, neutral will still be used.]</p>
 <p>Jianshi gently sighed after seeing his demeanor. She knew that this man had no interest in their schools’ power. A man capable of keeping calm when tempted by power was incredibly unfathomable. This only made him even more frightening.</p>
 <p>“Let’s not talk about such boring topics.” Ruyan smiled: “May I ask if you are going to the Bonesea for the item of immortality?”</p>
 <p>It was time for Ruyan to lend Jianshi a hand by diverting the conversation away from the refusal.</p>
 <p>“The immortal item?” He smiled and shook his head: “I don't pursue immortality. Plus, the Bonesea doesn't necessarily have it.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan replied: “I heard many people are going there with this goal. Even a few Godkings from the previous generation are coming into being. Gu Chun’s four branches, the Roaring Conch, the Seven Martial Pavilion, and the Dream Empyrean — these behemoths are all going for the artifact. If you are not aiming for it, why are you going?”</p>
 <p>He chuckled: “Let me ask you that instead, why are you two going?”</p>
 <p>Ruyan winked in response: “We are going because of you. Just who is it that made you so charming? Others have no choice but to chase after you.”</p>
 <p>He gently shook his head and said: “Hahahaha, I do enjoy listening to such flattery, but don’t go too crazy in front of me, little beauty.”</p>
 <p>“We came in search for the skeletal horse.” Jianshi spoke softly into his ears. It was a very pleasant feeling.</p>
 <p>She continued: “Our ancient scrolls have recorded certain rumors about how Immortal Emperor Bu Si had a mount when he was still alive — a skeletal horse. However, this horse completely disappeared later on. The emperor’s destruction was very mysterious, so now when this horse appeared out of nowhere, we are curious to see what is going on.”</p>
 <p>“Your speculation is right.” Li Qiye nodded: “The horse is indeed Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s mount. To be exact, it was only his mount during his youth. Later on after Bu Si became an emperor, the mount was hidden away to never be ridden again.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan immediately became interested and asked: “Why was it hidden away?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the two and chuckled: “There are several different legends about this. One states that it has something to do with the emperor’s origin. Another believes that it has something to do with his ultimate end because he had been unkillable for so long. And lastly, some people think he is still trying to reincarnate.”</p>
 <p>“Reincarnate?” Both Ruyan and Jianshi were moved after hearing this. Reincarnation was, in fact, another form of immortality. It was just that the method was different.</p>
 <p>However, all of them had one similarity — no one was known to have succeeded. Many cultivators believed in reincarnation as part of the cosmic cycle, but no one knew whether it was real or not.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, this mysterious emperor had always been a hot topic. So now, when Li Qiye brought up reincarnation, the two girls were naturally surprised.</p>
 <p>Ruyan winked her alluring eyes and asked: “Which theory is most likely correct in your mind?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her with one eye and replied: “There’s no need to rope me into answering. Plus, even if I knew the truth, I wouldn’t necessarily let you know.”</p>
 <p>She coquettishly responded: “I’m only asking casually, why do you have to be so cautious?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled: “For the two of you, the Bonesea is still worth the trip. If you are lucky, you might be able to find your Void Imperfection School’s Windchase Break!”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Both of them cried out loud. Ruyan’s hands that were holding the teapot were trembling; tea almost spilled out of the pot. Jianshi also stopped her massage and opened her eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Jianshi excitedly stated: “Are you saying that our Windchase Break was lost at the Bonesea?!”</p>
 <p>Although others once claimed that their three schools had the most immortal physique laws, they had lost one of the most important things, an immortal physique strike!</p>
 <p>The Windchase Break was the attack created by Immortal Emperor Wu Gou. It was considered the strongest attack of their school.</p>
 <p>However, they lost it later on. Juniors like the two girls didn’t know how it went missing.</p>
 <p>Whenever their disciples toured the world, they would keep an eye out for clues about this attack. Nevertheless, nothing had ever turned up. Thus, Li Qiye’s revelation was a pleasant surprise to the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Is our Windchase Break really there in the Bonesea?” Ruyan’s eyes flared up as she stared at Li Qiye in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.</p>
 <p>Ruyan calmed down and actually brought the cup next to Li Qiye’s lips this time instead of just handing him the cup. Meanwhile, Jianshi gently began to massage his shoulders again.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1292: Lithodidae Overlord</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the two and gleefully said: “It is indeed possible that your Windchase Break has fallen into the Bonesea.”</p>
 <p>“How likely is it?” Even Jianshi, who has always been dignified and graceful, couldn’t contain herself.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye took another sip of tea. He cleared his throat then smiled: “There’s no need to be so anxious, little beauty. Since I have said so, it means that the possibility is very high. If it isn’t one hundred percent, it would at least be eighty or ninety percent…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye abruptly stopped at this point. His eyes flashed while looking outside.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were startled a bit, but they quickly regained their wits. Both were true experts, so they exchanged a glance before looking outside as well.</p>
 <p>Ruyan coldly glared at the bottom of the boat and declared: “Roll out here, whoever is hiding below.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi also realized that someone was hiding under the boat, so she became much more cautious.</p>
 <p>With that, a figure climbed up from the boat’s hull. He slightly wobbled forward after getting on.</p>
 <p>It was an old man dressed in gray. He was not especially tall, but his arms were very muscular and powerful. They looked like they would be a match for dragon claws.</p>
 <p>Anyone would be convinced that these arms had the power to move mountains and flip seas with their infinite might.</p>
 <p>But there was something even more eye-catching than his arms. He had a wooden coffin on his shoulders. It looked ordinary, but countless runes were engraved on it.</p>
 <p>His powerful arms were holding onto it for dear life, as if it was a supreme treasure. At the same time, he was stained with blood and wounds from a multitude of weapons. Some arrows were still stuck in his body.</p>
 <p>It was a human, so after seeing his own kin, he was glad and stumbled forward. His legs turned weak as he kneeled on the deck.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, please save me!” He was panting heavily after shouting his request as if the words had used up all of his strength.</p>
 <p>An old man covered in wounds came out of nowhere with a wooden coffin. No logical person would take him in. Ruyan and Jianshi glanced at each other before looking at this old man.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was also staring at him. To be exact, he was looking at the wooden coffin. His eyes were attracted to it as if there was a supreme treasure or beauty inside. He didn’t look away for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Their boat slowly stopped. Both girls slightly frowned and knew that something was about to happen.</p>
 <p>Ruyan grimaced and asked: “Why have we stopped?”</p>
 <p>“Schoolmaster, the Lithodidae Overlord’s battleship is in front of us. He wishes to board.” The disciple controlling the boat reported with haste.</p>
 <p>“Lithodidae Overlord.” This name made Jianshi furrow her brows as she spoke: “His notoriety can’t be overstated.”</p>
 <p>With that, she glanced at the kneeling old man. His body froze and was even shivering after hearing this title. Even though he tried his best to control his emotions, he couldn’t fool the two girls.</p>
 <p>They didn’t make a decision and instead turned towards Li Qiye. Without a doubt, they were waiting for him to decide.</p>
 <p>After a while, Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and returned to his chair before lazily saying: “Let him board.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Li Qiye’s approval, Ruyan immediately ordered the disciples: “Let him up.”</p>
 <p>The old man anxiously shouted: “Young Noble, please, please save me since we are both kindred spirits. Save both the old and young!” He was quite frightened.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled without promising or refusing the old man. He quietly sat there and stared at the old man with great interest.</p>
 <p>A short moment later, a person boarded the ship. Before he even arrived, a huge shadow was cast on the deck. In the blink of an eye, a burly man appeared in sight.</p>
 <p>He had the aura of a tyrannical king that could look down on the entire world. He wore a tight robe, showing off the details of his muscles. His body was surging with power, especially when he clenched his fists, lightning seemed to run through his entire being.</p>
 <p>He resembled a mad dragon that could destroy the world anytime.</p>
 <p>His forehead was covered with markings, making him look like a giant crab. Although they made him uglier, they also added to his vicious yet regal aura.</p>
 <p>The Lithodidae Overlord was a famous ruler at the Dragon Demon Sea from the Regal Valley. This was a lineage everyone knew in this region. It was created by the Lithodidae Sea God, someone who lived during the generation of Immortal Emperor Yin Long, the most recent sea god in history.</p>
 <p>His notoriety was not only built on his ancestor's shadow. He himself was quite powerful and stood out even in the vast Dragon Demon Sea. Of course, the reason for his infamy was not his strength, but rather his ruthlessness. He would massacre someone’s entire race for opposing him.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he also enjoyed hunting famous people and young talents with great potential even if they didn’t provoke him. In fact, he had a penchant for hunting rare races as well.</p>
 <p>He enjoyed certain abnormal acts such as taking their heads or other precious things as trophies.</p>
 <p>He had hunted enemies more powerful than himself and even poisonous and ferocious creatures. More often than not, it wouldn’t be through a head-on confrontation since he was a man of subterfuge. Traps and outnumbering his quarry were some of the methods he would employ in his hunt.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he himself greatly enjoyed the process. Because of this, he was notorious. Few would dare to provoke him since the Regal Valley was mighty as well.</p>
 <p>“So it is Schoolmaster Zhuo and Schoolmaster Liu. Excuse my sudden visit.” He cupped his fist after seeing the two girls.</p>
 <p>Despite his polite gesture, his eyes showed flashes of desire after seeing the two beauties. Of course, he hid it quite well.</p>
 <p>Ruyan sat right next to Li Qiye while Jianshi was still giving his back a massage.</p>
 <p>“Lithodidae Overlord, long time no see.” Ruyan gently nodded without moving.</p>
 <p>Even though he was a wicked tyrant, in terms of strength, status, and influence, he was no match for Ruyan and Jianshi. The Regal Valley was inferior to the Void Imperfection Three Schools as well.</p>
 <p>His eyes fell upon Li Qiye, but he didn’t recognize the youth so he turned towards the kneeling old man. He immediately asked the two girls: “Schoolmasters, this person is a traitor to our Regal Valley. He stole our supreme treasure and fled. We have chased him all the way here, so I hope Schoolmasters will hand this traitor over to us. We shall give him a fair and just trial.”</p>
 <p>“Schoolmasters, I, I am not a traitor to the Regal Valley and I definitely didn’t steal any treasure from them since I’m a vagabond. Schoolmasters, Young Noble, you must believe me!” The old man grew nervous after hearing the overlord, so he quickly defended himself.</p>
 <p>“Schoolmasters, don’t listen to his lies, he is adept at deceiving others.” The overlord replied: “If you don’t believe me, you can go to our Regal Valley to verify…”</p>
 <p>“He’ll stay.” At this time, Li Qiye casually told the overlord: “You can leave now.”</p>
 <p>The overlord’s expression turned stiff after hearing this response. However, he put on a smile and cupped his fist towards Li Qiye: “May I know your name?”</p>
 <p>With characters like the two women serving the youth, the overlord didn’t dare to show contempt. He thought that this might be an ancestor of the three schools.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye casually stated his name. His eyes were on the coffin; he seemed to be particularly interested in the runes.</p>
 <p>“So it is Young Noble Li, your prestige has spread quite far. I have been your admirer for a long time.” The overlord inwardly quivered after hearing this name. He finally knew just what kind of person he had encountered.</p>
 <p>Recently, Li Qiye’s fierce fame soared like a dragon to let him become the number one among the younger generation of the humans. His fame had even caught up with the Seashield Prince, the Martial Goddess, and the Profound Monarch.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only casually acknowledged the compliments with a hum. He didn’t even bother to look at the overlord.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li, this man is a traitor to our valley and is holding our supreme treasure…” The overlord was quite dissatisfied with Li Qiye’s arrogant attitude, but he managed to endure his annoyance.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1293: Xiong Qianbei</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye interrupted him and dismissively said: “People from the Xiong Clan have never been disciples of the Regal Valley. Don’t play tricks in front of me.”</p>
 <p>The overlord was taken aback after hearing this while the old man echoed: “Young Noble, you are right, I’ve never been their valley’s disciple, he is trying to frame me.”</p>
 <p>The overlord’s expression turned a bit ugly, but he quickly restored his smile: “Young Noble Li, your words are a bit too arbitrary…”</p>
 <p>“I’ve always been an arbitrary person.” Li Qiye interrupted him and flatly asserted: “This person is now under my protection, leave.”</p>
 <p>The overlord’s expression dimmed as a fierce flash streaked across his eyes, but he still maintained his friendly demeanor: “I have always respected the heroes of all races, and the same goes for your prestige. If Young Noble Li and the schoolmasters wish to protect this traitor, then I will give you some face and no longer pursue this matter.”</p>
 <p>This reply was quite generous and sensible. Anyone else would feel their days brighten up. To be given such respect was a kind of honor.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye was still as cold as before. From start to finish, he didn’t even give the overlord a single glance.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the overlord didn’t become angry. He bid his farewell with a smile: “Young Noble Li, Schoolmasters, this is goodbye for now. However, with the world as small as it is, I hope that everyone will come visit my Regal Valley one day. I will surely show you my greatest hospitality.”</p>
 <p>“Valley Lord, you are too polite.” Ruyan and Jianshi were still courteous. As lords of their sects, they naturally had to act gracefully.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye, on the other hand, was completely indifferent. His attitude would make others think that he was overbearingly arrogant.</p>
 <p>The overlord smiled and left in a cool manner.</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled after he left: “Young Noble, you are now on that guy’s list, and he will never let go of his prey. He’s a brute famous for wanting to hunt people stronger than him. You are the rising rookie of the human race, and since you have opposed him, you are now the prime candidate on his list.”</p>
 <p>“Then let him come and die.” Li Qiye simply didn’t give a damn about the overlord’s pretentious and friendly act.</p>
 <p>He had seen countless people ranging from Immortal Emperors to nobodies. What kind of character had he not met? How could the overlord’s little play elude his eyes?</p>
 <p>The old man felt that he found a path to survival after hearing Li Qiye’s nonchalant and confidence-filled statement. He quickly prostrated on the ground to say: “Young Noble, thank you for saving my life. This lowly one will never forget your kindness.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Schoolmasters, for being on the side of righteousness.” He bowed to the two girls as well.</p>
 <p>Ruyan responded with a faint smile: “You sure know how to talk, putting the hat of being your saviors on our head. It looks like it will be difficult for us not to save you.”</p>
 <p>The old man coughed, but he still shamelessly bowed before them. [1. If you accept the gesture, you have the responsibility to protect him because of face.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the old man and asked: “What is your name?”</p>
 <p>He quickly answered: “Young Noble, this lowly one’s name is Qianbei, a disciple of the Xiong Clan.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lightly spoke: “The Xiong has fallen, they do not exist in the Heaven Spirit World any longer.”</p>
 <p>Xiong Qianbei felt dejected after hearing this and replied with sorrow: “You are right, this little one is only a wandering ghost.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s attention was on the wooden coffin on the old man’s back. He lowered his tone: “Where did you get this coffin from?”</p>
 <p>Both the girls became curious as well. Ever since the old man got here, Li Qiye’s eyes rarely left the coffin. They were curious about what the contents of the coffin could be to attract someone like Li Qiye who was indifferent to everything.</p>
 <p>Qianbei was alarmed. He gripped the coffin even tighter while stumbling backward.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Young Noble, these are the remains of my ancestor. I’m looking for a place to bury them.” He smiled wryly in response.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye responded in a cold tone: “Old man, don’t play in front of me. Lying in my presence is a very unwise move. I can save you from the Lithodidae Overlord, but I can also smash you to pieces!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about your life or whether you are human or a sea demon. Your background is of no interest to me either. I did it for the wooden coffin on your back.” Li Qiye’s eyes turned extremely cold: “If you can understand this, then do not lie in front of me or else you will come to understand what true horror is.”</p>
 <p>Although Li Qiye didn’t emit a scary aura or a suppressive momentum, when his eyes turned cold, Qianbei couldn’t help but quiver. He felt chills all over his body while his legs grew weak.</p>
 <p>Even masters like the two girls felt chills. A terrifying light flashed across his eyes, a glint capable of annihilating all things.</p>
 <p>This was not an empty threat.</p>
 <p>Qianbei struggled to calm down, but he managed to speak: “Young Noble, I, I picked up this coffin by chance. Several days ago when the black star was crossing the sky, I was at sea to find some clams for pearls and this coffin suddenly emerged from the sea.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye batted his eyes after hearing this. He tried to confirm: “Was there a strange phenomenon such as a chasm splitting open the seabed?”</p>
 <p>“How did you know?” Qianbei was surprised. He didn’t hide it any longer: “That was indeed the case, the seabed suddenly split to form a deep trench when the dark star flew by, just like the Bottomless Trench in the Jade Sea. This coffin appeared and countless green branches pulled it out from the bottom. I was lucky enough to pick it up then…”</p>
 <p>“... By the time I recomposed myself, the trench had disappeared. I didn’t really understand what the coffin was before meeting the overlord. He had been pursuing me all this way while I ran for dear life. Luckily Young Noble was here to save me.” He coughed at this point.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only listened to the first half while not caring about the second half of the story. His eyes fell upon the coffin once more.</p>
 <p>Ruyan curiously asked Qianbei: “What is in the coffin?”</p>
 <p>Qianbei honestly answered: “I don’t know either. I couldn’t open this coffin no matter what I tried.”</p>
 <p>“These runes are very old, you won’t find any of them in this day and age.” Jianshi took a careful look at these indecipherable runes.</p>
 <p>Keep in mind that these two came from the Void Imperfection Three Schools, an ancient lineage. As schoolmasters, they were quite knowledgeable compared to ordinary people. Nevertheless, they were completely unable to understand the meaning of these runes.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye eventually told Qianbei: “I want this wooden coffin.”</p>
 <p>Qianbei’s expression sank as he took several steps back. He was clearly very reluctant to accept this demand.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Young Noble, well… about that…” Qianbei wryly smiled: “I, I need it to make a fortune!”</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled in response: “You want to get rich from this? Don’t forget who saved your life. Can you try to become rich when you are dead?”</p>
 <p>Qianbei became embarrassed after hearing this. He stood there awkwardly with a forced smile, not knowing what to do.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely said: “If I take action, regardless of how strong you are or what aces you have hidden, you will still lose the coffin.”</p>
 <p>Qianbei’s expression drastically changed again while he stumbled back even more, distancing himself further from Li Qiye. He awkwardly smiled: “This lowly one knows that you won’t rob me. I am indeed very grateful since you saved my life. It is, it is just that I have some predicaments, I hope you can understand.”</p>
 <p>“I only saved your life because it was a convenient way to get this wooden coffin. Don’t worry about that, I won’t blackmail you just because of this favor.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively.</p>
 <p>“I am ashamed before your noble bearing. If I can offer my service to you another day, I will do everything possible.” Qianbei relaxed after hearing this and quickly bowed again.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” Li Qiye coldly looked at him and asked: “What kinds of things will make you willingly hand over this coffin?”</p>
 <p>This question left Qianbei pondering. He looked at Li Qiye then the two girls while trying to find the right words.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1294: Wooden Coffin</b></p>
 <p>“Speak, there are few items in this world that I can’t afford.” Li Qiye slowly said: “Of course, you need to act sensibly. Don’t push it and lose the opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Both Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were very curious after seeing how much Li Qiye valued the coffin. What the hell was in this coffin?</p>
 <p>Xiong Qianbei hesitated for a bit before biting his teeth and making up his mind: “I do not dare to be greedy after being shown such kindness by Young Noble. I, I want a piece of land.”</p>
 <p>The two girls were surprised by this request. They both assumed Qianbei would want some treasures, elixirs or supreme merit laws, not a landmass.</p>
 <p>“Do you know how precious a piece of land in Heaven Spirit is?” Jianshi shook her head. This was a world where land was more precious than anything else.</p>
 <p>Qianbei replied: “This lowly one knows that. I won’t push my luck, I will be satisfied with a landmass around one hundred square miles.”</p>
 <p>“You’re not pushing your luck by asking for a piece of land the size of one hundred square miles?” Ruyan couldn’t help but laugh while shaking her head: “Do you know how valuable this much land is in Heaven Spirit?”</p>
 <p>Of course, a one hundred square mile piece of land was nothing in the other worlds. Even the minor branches of sects in those places would be much bigger. An ordinary disciple would be in charge of a territory of this size. However, land was too scarce in the Heaven Spirit World. This little piece of earth became especially precious here.</p>
 <p>“A lot of second and third tier sects only have islands this big.” Jianshi gently shook her head.</p>
 <p>“This old one knows.” Qianbei coughed in response: “However, this is a wooden coffin that incited a heavenly phenomenon. A meteor in the sky and a trench at the bottom of the sea — such a phenomenon is quite rare in this world. I believe this coffin is absolutely extraordinary, so I don’t think trading it for a one hundred square mile landmass is unreasonable.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan grinned and said: “Even if it is worth the trade, you still need to have the power to handle it. You might be paying with your life before getting the chance to reap the benefits.”</p>
 <p>She was telling the truth. If others knew that this coffin was truly worth a small island, many people would definitely try to rob him.</p>
 <p>“Well…” Qianbei played the fool to avoid this question.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled and flatly asked: “Even if I give you an island of that size, would you be able to keep it?”</p>
 <p>Without sufficient strength, such a landmass would simply be a prize to compete for in Heaven Spirit. The old man could be robbed of it at any moment!</p>
 <p>Qianbei solemnly answered: “Young Noble, I will try my best to guard it. If I have a piece of land, I will be able to reform my Xiong Clan. I shall treat it as my lifeblood.”</p>
 <p>After seeing his serious demeanor, Li Qiye smiled and slowly said: “You desire a piece of land? So be it, I shall give it to you!”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Qianbei couldn’t believe it. In fact, he didn’t place too much hope in this request. It was simply absurd, so Li Qiye accepting the trade made him think that this was a dream.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied: “My words are made of gold, what I say shall be done.”</p>
 <p>After hearing his resolute tone, Qianbei was ecstatic and quickly bowed: “Young Noble, this is giving us a new life. We shall remember your kindness for generations to come.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t care for such pleasantries and ordered: “Give me the coffin.”</p>
 <p>“Well…” Qianbei hesitated. After all, he still hadn’t received the land yet, so he didn’t want to hand over the wooden coffin first.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye continued: “Don’t worry, I said that I would give you a landmass, so I will when I’m done with my business.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble Li is a man of his word.” Jianshi added: “Our Sacred Spring School can guarantee you that he will give you what you want.”</p>
 <p>“My Evil Devourer School will do the same, so you can rest assured.” Ruyan smiled as well.</p>
 <p>Qianbei was glad to hear these two. They were both schoolmasters from an extremely reputable sect in Heaven Spirit. He could rest easy when these two put forth their guarantee for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He hurriedly placed the coffin in front of Li Qiye and respectfully said: “Young Noble, the coffin is now yours.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he respectfully stood to the side. Li Qiye gave him the side-eye, but Qianbei didn’t react.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan looked at him and teased: “What now, are you still afraid of not getting your land?”</p>
 <p>Qianbei shamelessly stood there and smiled: “No, Schoolmaster, please don’t misunderstand me. I trust the young noble and you two schoolmasters as well. Ah, everyone must be going to the Bonesea this time, correct? I also want to go broaden my horizons. If you need an errand boy or a coolie, I am ready to serve.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye lazily looked at him and casually commented: “Such a shameless disciple has probably never appeared in the Xiong Clan until now.”</p>
 <p>“Agh…” Qianbei’s face turned a bit hot, but he was too thick-skinned and continued to stand there while playing dumb.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored him and stood up. He circled around the coffin to carefully read the runes.</p>
 <p>Ruyan curiously speculated: “What’s in it? Don’t tell me it is just a corpse.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe it’s a treasury.” Qianbei couldn’t help but join in: “But how can you open it? I used all of my strength to hit it, but that didn’t do anything.”</p>
 <p>“I’d like to have a try.” Ruyan’s competitive nature rose. She stepped forward and placed both hands on the coffin while channeling her merit law. With her blood energy rising, a loud explosion ensued. She used a mighty force to lift it, aiming to remove the lid.</p>
 <p>One must know that with her strength, she could easily overturn a mountain. Her going all out would result in an unimaginable power that could only be described by the phrase, “hating the earth for not having a circular handle.” [1. This is a peculiar phrase — hating the earth for not having a circular handle. It is describing someone with so much energy and power that if there was a handle for the earth, they could swing the earth around. The other part of this phrase is a hiltless heaven. Hiltless heaven and handleless earth — describing an overwhelming power.]</p>
 <p>This force could tear apart the earth and rend the sky vault. However, even with her using all of her might, she couldn’t remove the lid of this coffin.</p>
 <p>“How can this be?” To Ruyan’s astonishment, there wasn’t the slightest sign of damage or fingerprint on it. Showboating was not in her nature, but she was quite confident in her own power.</p>
 <p>“Just what is this coffin?” Jianshi was shocked as well. They grew up and regularly competed against each other, so Jianshi understood Ruyan’s strength. Not even Godkings could stop characters of their level.</p>
 <p>“This is beyond your comprehension.” Li Qiye smiled: “In terms of forcefully opening it, not to mention the two of you, even an Immortal Emperor might not be able to do it.”</p>
 <p>This comment surprised both of the girls. What a monstrous claim! Anyone else would think that Li Qiye was just exaggerating, but they actually believed him.</p>
 <p>“What the hell is inside?” Qianbei was completely drawn in. Even though he was the one who found the coffin, he didn’t know what was inside or what was so special about it.</p>
 <p>“We’ll find out soon enough.” Li Qiye chuckled and placed his palm on the coffin, then he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>His palm remained unmoving. He didn’t release a crazy amount of blood energy or unstoppable laws and dao. It was simply him touching the coffin.</p>
 <p>As moments passed, Li Qiye seemed to be caught in a deep sleep. Everyone else held their breaths; they didn’t want to break his concentration.</p>
 <p>Even more time went on while the three remained completely quiet. Qianbei was a bit disappointed after thinking that this coffin might not be opened so easily.</p>
 <p>However, at this very second, the runes came together to form the image of a tree of life. A majestic life force engulfed the area as if something was returning to life.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1295: Woman In The Coffin</b></p>
 <p>“Buzz.” The runes resembling a tree of life flashed. Next, they jumped into the coffin as if the tree wanted to take root within.</p>
 <p>After their disappearance, one could hear a clank as if something was sliding within the coffin. Shortly afterward, the clicking of a lock could be heard. The tightly shut coffin suddenly came loose.</p>
 <p>Qianbei excitedly blurted: “It’s open, it’s open!”</p>
 <p>“What, how can this be? It opened just like that?” Ruyan was slack-jawed while staring at Li Qiye. She and Jianshi didn’t notice Li Qiye doing anything special.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only placed his palm on the coffin; he didn’t do anything, yet he was still able to open the coffin. This was simply inconceivable.</p>
 <p>In fact, Qianbei wondered the same thing. He had the coffin for several days and used many methods in order to try and open it, but they all ended in failure.</p>
 <p>But now, Li Qiye opened it in such a simple manner.</p>
 <p>“This is not an ordinary coffin. It already had this form upon its inception, an object created by the heaven and earth. Brute force is of no use, so we have to do it like this.” Li Qiye pointed at his heart: “You must use your heart to feel and your mind to sense before awakening it. Only your heartbeat will let it know the location of life.”</p>
 <p>These words were incredibly profound and inexplicable. The two girls carefully savored his teaching. As for Qianbei, even though he didn’t quite understand, he still did his best to memorize them.</p>
 <p>With that, Li Qiye slowly opened the lid in a very gentle and cautious manner, as if the ultimate treasure was contained within.</p>
 <p>The girls were very curious, so they inched closer in order to get a better look.</p>
 <p>After seeing what was inside, both were gobsmacked with flaring eyes. They stared at the coffin in complete disbelief.</p>
 <p>Qianbei thought that he was seeing things and rubbed his eyes. However, his vision was perfect. He murmured in shock: “Fairies do exist in this world...”</p>
 <p>Ruyan emotionally commented: “The word ‘beauty’ is not enough to describe her…”</p>
 <p>There was a very young woman lying inside the coffin, a beauty beyond the limits of the brush and ink.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi were ranked among the top beauties in Heaven Spirit. As schoolmasters, they didn’t rely on their beauty, but it was a source of pride for them. However, both of them were overshadowed by this woman.</p>
 <p>Words failed to convey the sight of her lying in the coffin. Her beauty had reached an unrealistic level. Her ten slender fingers rested on her stomach. She slept soundly and peacefully; although there was no smile on her face, her demeanor made it seem as if she was having a good dream.</p>
 <p>After a while, she slowly opened her eyes and eventually climbed out of the coffin, stupefying the three.</p>
 <p>The girls were drowned in admiration and felt that her dream-like beauty did not belong in this world.</p>
 <p>She was matchless and had a profound and immaculate gaze that stole the light from the celestials in the sky, causing them to be too ashamed to show themselves.</p>
 <p>Her figure, with flawless curves, was out of this world. Even the most scrutinizing gaze would fail to find any flaws. Her body seemed to be one with the world, the most beautiful of all objects.</p>
 <p>Her oval face was exquisitely stunning, an impeccable masterpiece of the heavens. Anyone who caught sight of it would be in awe and shock.</p>
 <p>Even though she wore a plain white dress, this didn’t diminish her presence. She was someone who didn’t require any decoration, jewelry was simply superfluous.</p>
 <p>This ordinary dress was the most suitable for her. Its simplistic style when adorned by her created the most beautiful charm.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi looked like two maids compared to her.</p>
 <p>Among all of Li Qiye’s female acquaintances, Ming Yexue and Mei Suyao were one of a kind. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them the prettiest girls in their respective worlds.</p>
 <p>However, they seemed to be missing a little something compared to this woman. It must be the elegant refinement that came from countless years.</p>
 <p>She was a fairy of the ages, groomed for an eternity with the aura of time, empowered by the spirit of the world. She had a charm that others could never hope to attain. It was an innate aura. One either had it at birth or didn’t.</p>
 <p>Jianshi couldn’t help but praise: “Such beautiful eyes!”</p>
 <p>“It isn’t an exaggeration to call her the most beautiful in the nine worlds!” Ruyan was quite proud of her appearance, but she was full of admiration.</p>
 <p>Qianbei was stupefied as he murmured: “She’s the most beautiful fairy in this world.”</p>
 <p>In his eyes, she could only exist in dreams to be appreciated from a distance.</p>
 <p>Among them, only Li Qiye remained normal. He wasn’t stunned by the beauty of the woman before him.</p>
 <p>The woman looked at the group. She seemed to be slightly hazy. Eventually, she looked at Li Qiye and asked: “Was it you who woke me?”</p>
 <p>Her voice was intoxicating; it was the sound of nature. The voices of the other two girls were quite alluring and pleasant as well, but there was still a great gap compared to this woman’s speech.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled and stretched out his hand to gently caress her face. Such an action was rude and befitted a cad. However, it seemed incredibly natural when performed by Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>She didn’t reject him. Her astral eyes met his head on. Their gazes locked onto each other and seemed to be crossing time itself back to an untraceable past.</p>
 <p>As he touched her pretty face, he slowly closed his eyes while she did the same.</p>
 <p>The whole scene turned quiet. Their physical contact assisted her in feeling his aura. Time seemed to have stopped as the two were falling into a deep slumber.</p>
 <p>Even the wind stopped blowing and time halted its flow. Nothing in this world wanted to disturb the two.</p>
 <p>It was a destined moment decided long ago. It looked as if they knew each other for a long time and had a deep affection for one another.</p>
 <p>After a long time, the two of them opened their eyes at the same time. Their movements were of the same beat.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye said with emotion: “Indeed… the eons are too numerous to count, so much has been lost.”</p>
 <p>The woman slightly tilted her head. Her eyes showed her slight confusion and wisdom as she spoke: “Are you a philosopher?” [1. I put some thought into this one. Wise man, sage, or philosopher. I’ve used sage for different words in the past, leaning towards the holy aspect rather than wisdom. This is a new word entirely in ED; it has never been used before, at least in my memories. Philosopher is a good fit for it. Wise man seemed out of place since I believe it is a type of status or position. Who knows? Just the nature of translating ED sometimes, especially when dealing with the past.]</p>
 <p>“No. I’m not a philosopher.” Li Qiye smilingly replied: “Others call me a murderous devil while some prefer the dark hand. There are all kinds of titles, but philosopher is a first.”</p>
 <p>“You are a philosopher.” The confused woman still gave this verdict. Despite her slightly bewildered expression, her eyes had cleared up and now held great conviction.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I’m a philosopher then.” Li Qiye gave up: “It is only a title, nothing too important.”</p>
 <p>With that, he took his time sitting down and patted at the chair next to him. She also sat down with a leisurely and natural demeanor. It was just a simple action, yet she seemed to be in tune with nature.</p>
 <p>“What’s your name?” Ruyan asked with interest while looking at this mysterious beauty.</p>
 <p>“Name?” She curiously stared at Ruyan.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1296: Fairy</b></p>
 <p>Ruyan noticed her confusion and quickly elaborated: “Yes, name, mine is Liu Ruyan. This is my senior sister, Zhuo Jianshi. What’s yours?”</p>
 <p>She introduced themselves to her. The woman glanced at Ruyan then Jianshi and tilted her head in contemplation. She seemed to be trying to remember her name, but after a long time, she replied: “I don’t know...?”</p>
 <p>The girls felt a bit sad while looking at the hazy woman who couldn’t recall her name. It felt like something was missing from her life.</p>
 <p>The woman’s eyes darted over to Li Qiye as she questioned: “Do I have a name?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her peerless appearance and mused for a moment before smiling: “You have no name in this world. Let’s call you Fairy then, a woman from a distant world.” [1. Note, fairy here = immortal + woman. Ren hates using the word fairy for immortal woman. He advocated femmortal instead at one time. The reason I’m pointing this out is because the word immortal is always in high emphasis, especially when Li Qiye said that she is from a distant world. Fairy alone doesn’t connect the two.]</p>
 <p>Fairy repeated her name and had no objections. Although “fairy” was not a name, the girls felt that it was very appropriate. It seemed that outside of her, no one else should be called “fairy”.</p>
 <p>Fairy seemed to be without joy and worries. She sat down next to Li Qiye and curiously looked at him: “What’s your name, then?”</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye smiled and gently fixed the loose hair on her forehead: “My parents said that I cried for seven days and nights after being born. However, crying is not necessarily a bad thing. It shows that there are still things in this world that can make you sad. If one can’t even feel sadness, then their world would be too bleak.”</p>
 <p>He paused for a moment before continuing: “They also said that I was really cute and cried a lot as a baby. Of course, those were tears of happiness, showing that this world was still splendid and beautiful. On the other hand, if everyone sheds tears instead of just one individual, then that world would be filled with despair. Once its inhabitants lose hope, it would face destruction.”</p>
 <p>With that, he softly sighed with a complicated expression.</p>
 <p>This comment of his seemed to be random and confusing, but Fairy listened carefully with amusement as if she was feeling something else.</p>
 <p>The other girls were intrigued as well. They thought about it and felt that his words encompassed many different meanings.</p>
 <p>It sounded like he was talking about himself but also not at the same time. Crying was definitely the topic, but it wasn’t the fundamental focus.</p>
 <p>There were some secrets hidden within these words that the two girls were unaware of. Fairy quietly sat there without replying. Her expression was melancholic, even a bit lonely and dazed.</p>
 <p>Her astral eyes were flashing as if she was recalling something but couldn’t quite grasp it.</p>
 <p>“My heart aches.” In the end, she told him this. It was a sudden remark without any reason.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye held her jade-like hand and solemnly looked into her eyes: “Pain is good, it shows that you are alive.”</p>
 <p>“Is it the same for you?” She stared at his eyes as if wanting to peer through the windows of his mind. Her clear gaze would illuminate his inner world.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye contemplated her question before revealing a smile: “As long as the heart is alive and beating, it will feel pain. However, a long-lasting pain will eventually lead to numbness. Life and death, departures and farewells — all of this will lead to calluses.”</p>
 <p>The confused woman asked: “Will it eventually be torn apart?”</p>
 <p>“That depends on the person.” Li Qiye still had a smile on his face: “I won’t let my heart be torn because I am a murderous devil, the hand of darkness. In this world, wherever I am shall be filled with corpses and blood. I am numb to life and death, so regardless of how the world is, I will never taste that tearing sensation again.”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Her eyes were both clear yet hazy. She stretched out her hand to touch his face as if wanting to feel his existence and heartbeat.</p>
 <p>He didn’t answer her question. A long silence ensued.</p>
 <p>“Your heart will feel pain.” Eventually, she sincerely looked at him with the demeanor of a serious child.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s expression turned stiff for a moment. After a long while, he replied: “That day will not come. I won’t allow it.”</p>
 <p>She curiously asked while tilting her head: “Why?”</p>
 <p>“Because I am Li Qiye. After making preparations for ages… my hands will find the answer to everything.” With that, he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>These words incited some memories within her, but not anything specific. It was as if there were matters or things that had been lingering in her mind. She seemed to hear crying in the distance. It was intangible and surreal.</p>
 <p>Fairy asked: “Did you hear the cries?”</p>
 <p>Li Qye slowly answered: “I have never heard the cries before, not that I’m able to.”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” She acted like a little girl ignorant of this world.</p>
 <p>He took his time answering: “A murderous devil does not care for the lamenting wails, so I do not hear them.”</p>
 <p>“You are not a devil.” She frowned. Despite her current innocent state, she was quite firm in this response.</p>
 <p>“I’m not a savior either.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile.</p>
 <p>Fairy ruminated the answer and found it logical before nodding in agreement.</p>
 <p>The rest of the group stared at them while listening to this strange conversation. These two behaved so naturally that if they hadn’t been watching from the start, they would have mistaken them for old friends.</p>
 <p>Moreover, their dialogue was incredibly bizarre and inexplicable beyond comprehension, as if they were from a different world.</p>
 <p>She eventually asked him like an inquisitive student: “What must be done for the heart to not ache and the ears to not hear the cries?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her in contemplation before holding her hands and earnestly saying: “There has never been a right answer to this, but I can give you two possible choices if you must know. First, stop worrying about it, you will grow numb as time passes. One day, you will stop feeling pain and the cries shall disappear.”</p>
 <p>Fairy pondered and found that this was not the answer she wanted. She looked at him again and asked: “What about the second?”</p>
 <p>“Kill the villainous heavens.” Li Qiye was completely serious: “This is a solution to your question. Alas, there is a chance that what you will find is … more pain and more cries…”</p>
 <p>She wholeheartedly considered this second answer for a very long time. This prompted her next question: “Would killing the villainous heavens really give an answer? One without pain and anguish?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat back down and spoke with sorrow: “I don’t know because no one has been successful before. There is no answer to that question. As I said before, killing him might only lead to even more agony.”</p>
 <p>She carefully savored his answer. Her star-like eyes were flashing randomly. The same fluctuations appeared again in her memories. In the end, nothing returned.</p>
 <p>She eventually inquired after a long reflection: “What should I do, then?”</p>
 <p>“That’s up to you.” Li Qiye gently sighed in response after showing a brief smile: “Everyone has their own path, but not all wish to start this journey in fear of failing and not reaching the end. It might be better to stop halfway.”</p>
 <p>He sentimentally concluded: “Ignorance can be bliss. Being in charge of the present is to have everything. Some have love, some have authority, and others are content with just having offspring. That is happiness to them. Ignorance is wonderful and very enviable.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1297: Bones Island</b></p>
 <p>Fairy mulled over Li Qiye’s comment. After a long time, she seemed to understand something and nodded to herself. The rest of the group still found the conversation to be puzzling and indiscernible.</p>
 <p>Of course, they didn’t know that this confusing story was actually referring to the pinnacle of the world, the ultimate topic among cultivators. The things involved were beyond their understanding.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat in his chair, seemingly deep in sleep, while Fairy kept him company. Her expression was a bit muddled, as if she was shouldering an eternal burden.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Li Qiye opened his eyes and told Liu Ruyan: “Before heading to the Bonesea, we’ll take a trip to Bones Island.”</p>
 <p>“I’m also tired, so I’ll be resting.” Li Qiye stood up then told Fairy: “You can just follow me.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll prepare a room for you, Young Noble.” Jianshi went to accommodate Li Qiye’s daily life.</p>
 <p>Before following Jianshi, Li Qiye looked at Xiong Qianbei and flatly said: “You also want to go to the Bonesea, right? Good, find something to do, I don’t keep idle people around.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, this lowly one will follow you. Just give me orders whenever you need something.” Qianbei was ecstatic and quickly bowed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t respond as he left with Fairy.</p>
 <p>Bones Island could be considered a famous destination in the Dragon Demon Sea. It was also very strange and creepy.</p>
 <p>True to its name, the entire island was made from bones. There were no vegetation or creeks and streams, only bones and more bones.</p>
 <p>Walking on the island was akin to walking on bones. Every single inch of the island was paved with this hard and white substance.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, they came in all shapes and sizes. Tibia, ribs, pelvic bones… There were also little pieces that resembled bird claws and arms as big as a bridge.</p>
 <p>The island had all kinds of buildings that acted as pavilions, rooms, and palaces… They were quite frightening as well.</p>
 <p>A huge skull was upside down on the ground, serving as a house. Huge elbow bones were put together while more bones were embedded on top in order to form pavilions. Other palaces were more intricate with many bones connected together…</p>
 <p>At the same time, the residents here were different as well. Unsurprisingly, they were skeletons. Of course, they were not all human skeletons in the ordinary sense.</p>
 <p>People would see skeletons with a crocodile’s skull and a human frame with more than ten bone spurs that resembled chicken claws on their backs. The two legs were made from thick and large rhinoceros bones.</p>
 <p>These strange skeletons wearing robes and walking on the streets were not strange images at all. The majority of the inhabitants on this island were skeletons made from strange bones.</p>
 <p>Compared to these weird creations, a human skeleton was a much stranger sight at Bones Island.</p>
 <p>When Ruyan’s ship was anchored outside the island, the inhabitants here came to receive them. One of them stood before the docking location.</p>
 <p>“Sir, may I ask why you are here at Bones Island?” This thing had an elephant’s skull, a body made out of fishbones, and the legs of a crane. Such a frame supporting its large skull was quite unbelievable.</p>
 <p>Moreover, its robe was quite loose, resulting in a very amusing scene. Others wouldn’t know what to think of it. If this was another location, a talking skeleton would scare the souls out of people.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at it and smiled: “I want to meet your island lord.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, Sir, I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. Bones Island does not have a lord.” The skeleton shook its head and smiled.</p>
 <p>Could you imagine a smiling elephant skull? This smile was even uglier than a crying grimace — a truly horrifying scene.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely replied: “Really now? I’ll eat first before seeing him. If he doesn’t come to see me, I’ll destroy this island.”</p>
 <p>Such words made Ruyan and Jianshi look at each other. Not too many would dare to make this claim at Bones Island.</p>
 <p>The inhabitants here were amalgamations of bones. They didn’t seem to be that powerful as they were only a bunch of bones put together.</p>
 <p>However, no one dared to provoke this area. Rumor has it that a very long time ago, a True God believed that he was invincible and wanted to research the mysteries of the island. Alas, he was captured alive and hung on the island. The people here pulled out his bones one by one. They said that this god screamed for nine days and nine nights before dying. Many experts got goosebumps after seeing his corpse.</p>
 <p>From then on, all the troublemakers steered clear of this island.</p>
 <p>“Sir, you are too funny.” The skeleton didn’t become angry, it only cheerfully said: “If you wish to eat, then please go to the Bones Restaurant. This way.”</p>
 <p>With that, it led the way for Li Qiye. Li Qiye smiled and followed it into the island while looking around.</p>
 <p>Bones were everywhere in sight. Strangely enough, it was a very clean location and the air was quite fresh.</p>
 <p>If it was any other location, the sheer number of bones would definitely result in corpse energy or a bad odor, but not here at Bones Island.</p>
 <p>It was outrageously clean to an abnormal level. Each bone was as white as ivory, as if they had been polished countless times.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye appreciated the scenery while following the skeleton. With regards to the bizarre circumstances, there were many places in the nine worlds where bones could walk and speak after returning to life.</p>
 <p>However, these creatures would be accompanied by other phenomena. For example, a skeleton in a burial ground would be empowered by a soulfire found in its eye sockets. Another scenario would be that the skeleton absorbed too much evil energy and became a walking corpse.</p>
 <p>However, it was completely different here. These skeletons didn’t have soulfires or evil energy. They were made up of pure bones.</p>
 <p>This prompted the question, how were they created? What was the power fueling them?</p>
 <p>This enigma continued to confound all of the researchers because no one dared to maneuver against the inhabitants here.</p>
 <p>In fact, Li Qiye was not the only foreign guest traveling on the island. People from all over the seas came to visit.</p>
 <p>In normal times, cultivators from Dragon Demon Sea would come to experience the unique magical properties of the island. But now, it was needless to say that everyone who was on their way to the Bonesea had to go through Bones Island. Because of this, they decided to rest here and check out the wonders at the same time. Thus, it was quite lively with many different races from the outside present.</p>
 <p>This skeleton brought Li Qiye to a restaurant made from a huge skull. The two eye sockets acting as doors instilled a chilling sensation.</p>
 <p>However, the scarier part was that the restaurant was filled with cultivators from the outside. They came from all over the world while the serving skeletons swerved around them with wine and meals. It was a party in full swing. Of course, these cultivators were here for an adventure and to satiate their curiosity, it wasn’t for the food.</p>
 <p>This scene would be horrifying to unwary spectators. They would think that this was a grand feast of the underworld.</p>
 <p>“Meow, meow, meow…” When Li Qiye walked into the restaurant, a skeletal cat that was squatting in front of the counter waved towards Li Qiye. It looked like it was meant to be a lucky cat if it were alive. [1. The Chinese version of maneki-neko or "lucky cat", a Japanese figurine cat usually found at the entrance of shops, restaurants, etc. They’re believed to bring good fortune.]</p>
 <p>“Lil’ Bones, our guests are here, take good care of them.” The skeleton told the cat and left.</p>
 <p>Even the tables in this restaurant were made from bones. Li Qiye’s table was made out of finger bones while his chair was made from leg bones. There was a chilling sensation whenever someone sat down.</p>
 <p>A waiter came and cheerfully smiled at him: “Sir, what would you like?”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1298: Mu Shaolong</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye responded with his own smile and said: “Bring out your best dishes.”</p>
 <p>“Sir, our specialities are ghostblood wine and dried bones.” The waiter answered very quickly: “Do you still want some?”</p>
 <p>“One serving of each, then.” Li Qiye maintained his carefree smile.</p>
 <p>“Okay, one ghostblood wine and one dried bones!” The waiter shouted and then left. He came back soon afterward with a bottle of wine.</p>
 <p>The bottle was made out of a polished skull. The nose was where the wine came out. The cup was made from bone as well, and there was an eye as big as an ox’s with blood inside.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coolly poured wine into the cup. The liquid was blood-red. Some little explosions resounded when the wine entered the cup as bubbles that resembled skulls popped here and there.</p>
 <p>The scariest part was the red eye in the cup. It started moving after making contact with the wine. The liquid began to slowly boil and emit a comforting aroma.</p>
 <p>Wine made of blood and a cup made out of bone with a rotating eye inside. Even though the comforting aroma was very tempting, how many people would actually dare to drink it with this presentation?</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind and gently took a sip. The alcohol was strong but not dry, pure without being overly concentrated — an excellent taste.</p>
 <p>After finishing one cup, he poured another for himself. The eye in the cup seemed to be very close to the drinker, but it didn’t disturb Li Qiye at all.</p>
 <p>He drank and glanced around at the many varied guests in the restaurant.</p>
 <p>Some came to adventure while others came with purpose. Many also only wanted to rest.</p>
 <p>The majority of the cultivators were here at Bones Island for the first time, so they were quite curious and looked back and forth.</p>
 <p>Among the guests, two young men were particularly conspicuous due to the groups surrounding them. The members of the groups were Virtuous Paragons from the previous generation. Interestingly enough, they seemed to be flattering the two.</p>
 <p>They didn’t come from the same sect; one grew up to be quite handsome while the other was brave and bright in appearance.</p>
 <p>A young cultivator asked with an obsequious grin: “Young Noble Bao, are you going to the Bonesea this time as well?”</p>
 <p>“I’m here to scout as a foot soldier for my grandmaster.” The handsome youth smiled. He spoke with a fairly reserved tone, but there was an air of pride around him.</p>
 <p>“Is Senior Zhentian also coming?” An old paragon was startled and in disbelief.</p>
 <p>The youth spoke with pride: “Yes. Gentlemen, I’ll share something with you all. My grandmaster has come into being, he will definitely become the Immortal Emperor of this generation.”</p>
 <p>“Meng Zhentian…” The crowd was shocked as if a bomb had went off. The initially bustling restaurant quieted down. Only gasps could be heard. [1. Meng Zhentian = Dream Suppressing (the) Heaven. A cool name, so you know he’s a cool character?]</p>
 <p>“Is Senior Meng really coming out in this generation?” The older paragons couldn’t hide their astonishment.</p>
 <p>This handsome young man was Bao Yujiang, hailing from the Dream Empyrean. This was a mighty charming spirit lineage in this region. However, the thing that people were most afraid of was its Era Evader and supreme existence, Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>The heroic youth smiled and told the paragons: “Brother Hu, Brother Bao wouldn’t hide such a grand event from you.”</p>
 <p>These two youths were decently strong, but they still had a long way to go compared to the other geniuses. However, they still dared to call paragons from the previous generation as brothers.</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang’s master was Cao Guojian, a direct disciple of Meng Zhentian. Therefore, even the contemporary geniuses had to give him some face.</p>
 <p>As for the heroic youth, his talents weren’t bad, but more importantly, he came from the Celestial Pavilion. Even though the disciples from this sect rarely traveled outside, they enjoyed great respect on these rare occasions.</p>
 <p>His name was Mu Shaolong, a relatively high-ranking member of the pavilion. Compared to the grand characters who didn’t like to come out, he enjoyed running outside to make friends. Because of this, even though his cultivation was inferior to his peers such as the Extreme Yang Monarch, he was still famous in Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shaolong is right. My grandmaster was good friends with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong, so he didn’t wish to compete against the emperor as that would ruin their brotherhood. He evaded that era and is coming out for the Heaven’s Will this time.” Bao Yujiang nodded and held his head high when talking about his grandmaster.</p>
 <p>He was not one to bully others due to his background, but he couldn’t help but exude great confidence when referring to his grandmaster, Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>The guests here felt suffocated as cold chills ran through their bodies after hearing this.</p>
 <p>Meng Zhentian’s name had a supreme effect in Heaven Spirit; anyone would be scared after hearing his name. Rumor has it that he was only one step away from becoming an Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong broke the silence and smiled: “Congratulations, Brother Bao. When Senior Meng becomes Immortal Emperor, you will surely lead an imperial legion across the nine worlds.”</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong’s vanity was greatly stroked by this comment. He felt quite pleased and replied: “Please, Brother Shaolong, you are too kind. In the future, I will still need your assistance. Who doesn’t know that the Celestial Pavilion is a place full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers? If the Lunargrasp Fairy comes out, no one can oppose her in the nine worlds.”</p>
 <p>Even though Bao Yujiang was gloating at the moment, he didn’t dare to flaunt his haughtiness in front of Mu Shaolong and returned the praise.</p>
 <p>“My matriarch has been in seclusion for a long time now. Juniors like us don’t even have the chance to seek an audience.” Mu Shaolong enjoyed the comment, but he still softly sighed.</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang quickly replied while smiling: “Senior Lunargrasp is already invincible. She is enlightened and understands all the mysteries in this world. It isn’t strange for her to be seclusive at all.”</p>
 <p>People were shocked by Meng Zhentian earlier, but the atmosphere became even quieter when the Lunargrasp Fairy was mentioned.</p>
 <p>This name had not been brought up for a long time, but it was still more than enough to shake the entire Heaven Spirit World.</p>
 <p>The Celestial Pavilion was a mysterious lineage. Being low-key failed to demonstrate their incredible strength. Despite not having an Immortal Emperor, it was even more powerful than an imperial lineage. Rumor has it that celestial immortals had appeared in the pavilion before, but no one knows if this was true or not.</p>
 <p>The Lunargrasp Fairy deterred an entire era. This fear only spread when she didn’t come into being from one generation to another! Why? It was because she was the most powerful rival of Empress Hong Tian!</p>
 <p>Even Li Qiye, who was sitting there leisurely without a care for the two’s conversation, batted his eyes after hearing the name “Lunargrasp.”</p>
 <p>He looked over at Mu Shaolong and calmed himself before asking: “Is the Lunargrasp Fairy still living alone at Fullmoon Peak?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye suddenly stood out in this quiet restaurant. There weren’t that many humans in Heaven Spirit to begin with. If the crowd wasn’t distracted by the conversation, they would have noticed a human like Li Qiye much earlier.</p>
 <p>“Yes, how did you know?” Mu Shaolong was startled and looked over at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer. He was lamenting in his mind as the past resurfaced along with many emotions.</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong smiled and asked: “May I ask for your name, Brother?”</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye.” He looked at Mu Shaolong and nodded with a smile. His personality normally wouldn’t care for other cultivators outside of those who were too ignorant to know any better, so his current attitude towards Mu Shaolong was considered very friendly.</p>
 <p>After the words “Li Qiye” sounded, some of the cultivators were aghast. A few even moved away from him to keep a safe distance.</p>
 <p>Even though they hadn’t seen Li Qiye before, his notoriety had spread far and wide. Many in Heaven Spirit were well-aware of his fierceness.</p>
 <p>Sacrificing a billion teeming fish, massacring Wyvern and the Bloodshark Village, and most importantly, killing Shangguan Feiyan — these were all deeds that astounded the masses.</p>
 <p>“So it is Brother Li, I have heard of your name long ago.” Mu Shaolong cupped his fists politely. Of course, he didn’t need to flatter a human like Li Qiye. The Celestial Pavilion had no need to fawn over anyone.</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang was immediately interested and asked with a smile: “Brother Li, you are now famous all over the world, why not sit down and have a few drinks with us?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, come and sit with us. If Brother Bao could take Brother Li to see Senior Zhentian, I’m sure the senior would appreciate him.” Mu Shaolong could see that Yujiang was interested, so he echoed the sentiment.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1299: Old Zhu</b></p>
 <p>In recent days, Li Qiye was preeminent among the humans. Many even thought that he had the highest chance of becoming an Immortal Emperor for his race. The humans here had high hopes for him.</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang wanted to earn Li Qiye’s favor. Although he said he wanted to introduce Li Qiye to his grandmaster, this was only to attract him so that he might join his own ranks.</p>
 <p>In his eyes, his grandmaster would certainly become an Immortal Emperor. As his granddisciple, he was qualified to lead a legion. If he could have someone as strong as Li Qiye as his underling, it would increase his power and status later on.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only maintained his smile and continued to drink his ghostblood wine.</p>
 <p>Yujiang felt disrespected at Li Qiye’s lack of response. Even though he wasn’t considered a genius, his backing was quite immense and allowed him to do whatever he pleased regardless of the location. But now, this public lack of sensibility from Li Qiye left him in a tough spot, worsening his mood.</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t retaliate, he scowled with an angry expression.</p>
 <p>“Well, this can be considered a missed opportunity. How unfortunate, it will be prohibitively difficult to get the same chance in the future.” Mu Shaolong shook his head when he saw Li Qiye’s lack of consideration. Of course, he wouldn’t interfere with Bao Yujiang’s matter.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bao, you should come to the Jade Sea some time, I’ll be your guide.” After noticing that Yujiang was recruiting, a smart youth immediately tried to please him.</p>
 <p>“Virtuous Nephew, the doors to our Sacredheart Gate will always be open to you.” Even an old paragon withdrew his strong display in order to earn some points.</p>
 <p>The young ones wanted to become his friends or at least underlings if possible. As for the older generation, it was too much for paragons like them to work under Yujiang. Nevertheless, they were still willing to lower their own status in order to befriend him.</p>
 <p>Meng Zhentian was coming into being in this generation. In the eyes of the inhabitants of Heaven Spirit, it was certain that he would become an Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>True to his name, he was powerful enough. Some even said that one would be hard-pressed to find a worthy foe for him in the entire nine worlds.</p>
 <p>For many, it was easier to befriend an emperor before they ascended the throne than try to establish a relationship afterward.</p>
 <p>Just having the tiniest relationship with an emperor or becoming one of their soldiers was not only a fast way towards success, even their sects would ride their coattails towards glory.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye was only interested in the Lunargrasp Fairy. As for this Meng Zhentian and Bao Yujiang, he didn’t place them in his sight at all, so he no longer paid attention to them. Instead, he looked at the time and then outside.</p>
 <p>At this time, his food was served. Li Qiye didn’t look at it for long before he asked the waiter: “Your old man isn’t here today to sell stuff?”</p>
 <p>“Sir, are you talking about Old Chu?” The waiter smiled: “The number of visitors has recently skyrocketed. He is usually very punctual, maybe something is holding him up.”</p>
 <p>Right after the waiter finished speaking, a clank came from outside the door as a person came in.</p>
 <p>The waiter cheerfully told Li Qiye: “Speaking of the devil, Old Chu is here.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shifted his gaze towards the door. A person with a complete human skeleton was walking in. He wore a wide robe while carrying a big wooden trunk. He himself was just a tiny skeleton. Appearance wise, he wasn’t that special.</p>
 <p>However, it was rare to see a complete skeleton on Bones Island; it was much rarer than seeing living beings.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s smile widened after seeing this little skeleton.</p>
 <p>“Clang, clang, clang!” Old Chu came inside and rang his bell. A hoarse voice came from his chest: “Immemorial secret bones, heaven-seer divine gaze, the hand of an immortal… Everything is on sale!”</p>
 <p>The first-timers were very curious when they saw this little merchant. As for those who had been here before, they were very cautious of Old Chu, but they were curious nonetheless.</p>
 <p>“Immemorial secret bones, heaven-seer divine gaze, the hand of an immortal?” A regular visitor couldn’t help but ask: “Old Chu, are you selling counterfeits?”</p>
 <p>“Counterfeits?” Old Chu stared at this cultivator. Despite not having eyes, his attitude was clear. He retorted: “My reputation has been gold-clad for nine reincarnations, I would never sell counterfeits.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, stop with your trickery. Last time, I bought a piece of bone from a Thundervoid Kui, but it was completely useless and almost killed me.” The cultivator snorted.</p>
 <p>Old Chu explained with a smile: “Oh, that Thundervoid Kui bone? You didn’t buy its blood, this type of bone requires the blood of the beast as well before it is able to divert a thunder tribulation.”</p>
 <p>The smile of a skeleton like this was a macabre sight.</p>
 <p>“Then why didn’t you tell me this when I bought the bone?” The cultivator was quite dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>Old Chu asked: “My bad, I didn’t have the goods last time, but I thought you knew. Now that I think about it, I just so happen to have some Thundervoid Kui blood, do you want a bottle?”</p>
 <p>The old cultivator wanted to vomit blood. He had been swindled by Old Chu once, but he couldn’t do anything about it. No one would recklessly attack the skeletons on this island.</p>
 <p>“What are the immemorial secret bones?” Mu Shaolong’s curiosity was piqued.</p>
 <p>Old Chu looked over at Shaolong and somewhat mysteriously spoke: “Can’t say, can’t say. When you buy it, you will learn its magical effects right away.”</p>
 <p>“How much?” Shaolong was from the Celestial Pavilion, so money was not a problem for him.</p>
 <p>“My business has but a single rule: I only accept longevity blood, nothing else.” Old Chu shook his head in response.</p>
 <p>Some first-timers exchanged glances. Longevity blood was too precious for cultivators, especially the older ones.</p>
 <p>“How much? One bottle?” Shaolong was very interested in the bones.</p>
 <p>“From you?” Old Chu shook his head again: “Your blood won’t do. I need at least one bottle of longevity blood from a supreme Godking for this deal.” [1. Don’t know if Supreme is a rank for Godking or just a regular adjective. Leaving it as an adjective for now until the author indicates otherwise.]</p>
 <p>“Longevity blood of a Godking?!” Shaolong was startled after hearing this. Despite having deep pockets, he couldn’t come up with this type of item.</p>
 <p>When one reached the level of Godking, they wouldn’t easily extract their own longevity blood.</p>
 <p>“What about the hand of an immortal?” Yujiang felt like asking.</p>
 <p>Old Chu happily answered: “Not expensive at all, just ten drops of Immortal Emperor Longevity Blood.”</p>
 <p>The crowd’s expression changed. Ten drops of imperial blood was priceless. Just one drop alone could make a man beyond wealthy. Not even an imperial lineage could necessarily produce ten drops.</p>
 <p>Someone who had been here before asked: “Old Chu, why are your goods so expensive this time around?”</p>
 <p>Old Chu replied: “The situation has changed. The artifact of immortality has come out and the Bonesea is surging. Recently, I obtained a number of treasures, but in reality, it is everyone’s fortune.”</p>
 <p>Despite this, this sky-high price was not something that they could afford.</p>
 <p>“Give me a box of protection talismans.” While the others were asking if Old Chu had other items, Li Qiye knew exactly what he wanted.</p>
 <p>“Coming. Sir, what kind of protection talisman do you want?” Old Chu started to beam after finding a customer. His skeletal expression was incredibly lifelike.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t say anything; instead, he put a small bottle on the table. Old Chu took it and shook it next to his ear. His expression turned serious right away. He opened his wooden box and carefully looked inside before taking out an antique box with an old smell. He placed it before Li Qiye and said in a serious manner: “Sir, these are the talismans that you wanted.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother checking the contents and casually stored this box away in his robes.</p>
 <p>“Old Chu, you still have more talismans?” One of his old customers asked with surprise: “I thought you ran out a while ago?”</p>
 <p>Old Chu bragged: “Hehehe, because of the phenomenon going on at the Bonesea right now, I risked my old life to and found a batch of the best talismans. Do you want some?”</p>
 <p>A junior asked in response: “What are these protection talismans?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a talisman for the Bonesea that protects the body from potential attacks.” The cultivator stared at Old Chu, wondering if he should buy some or not.</p>
 <p>“Can his talismans actually protect people in the Bonesea?” Many eyes lit up after hearing this. After all, everyone wanted to go to the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>A cultivator palpitating from excitement asked: “Give me a box, what’s the price?”</p>
 <p>Old Chu responded: “One bottle of longevity blood.”</p>
 <p>The cultivator hesitated for a moment before taking out his own longevity blood and handing it to Old Chu.</p>
 <p>The old man took out a wooden box from the trunk and handed it to him. The cultivator looked at it and asked: “How come mine is different?”</p>
 <p>His box was drastically different from Li Qiye’s.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1300: The Lord Of Bones Island</b></p>
 <p>Old Chu smilingly responded: “As people say, you get what you pay for. The bottle that gentleman brought earlier isn’t something you can afford.”</p>
 <p>The cultivator was embarrassed after hearing this. He looked at him and asked: “Can your talismans really protect us?”</p>
 <p>“Like I said just now, you get what you pay for. If one talisman isn’t enough, put a few more on. You won’t be able to go too far with these cheap goods though.” The old man grinned.</p>
 <p>There was nothing the cultivator could do. He felt that he got swindled by the old man again.</p>
 <p>Even though some people felt that Old Chu was slightly untrustworthy, several still bought these protection talismans and hoped for the best.</p>
 <p>As for irrationally expensive items like this hand of the immortal, they didn’t dare ask about buying them.</p>
 <p>“Clang, clang, clang…” After seeing the interest die down, Old Chu left the restaurant and began his peddling once more while ringing his bell: “Immemorial secret bones, heaven-seer divine gaze, the hand of an immortal…”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled. He handed money to the waiter and left as well.</p>
 <p>Old Chu only left slightly before Li Qiye and didn’t walk too fast, so Li Qiye caught up right away.</p>
 <p>He was not in a rush to talk to Old Chu, so he leisurely tailed the old man while looking at the buildings and pretty scenes around Bones Island.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the old man didn’t notice Li Qiye behind him. He walked and shook the bell in his hand while loudly advertising.</p>
 <p>In this fashion, the two of them slowly walked through several streets. The moment they reached an alley, Old Chu stopped and slowly turned around.</p>
 <p>His cheekbones produced a smile as he asked: “Sir, do you still want to buy more?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye walked forward and looked at him to say: “I don’t want to buy anything, but I do want to meet your master, the lord of this island.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, Sir, I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. We don’t have a master or an island lord.” Old Chu laughed in response.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly stated: “I don’t wish to repeat myself.”</p>
 <p>The old man was still smiling. He shook his head and replied: “Sir, this lowly one is only a nobody trying to do some business, I don’t understand what you are—”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish, he was suddenly frozen still. A law from Li Qiye pinned itself to Old Chu’s forehead. Li Qiye took action without any warning; he was faster than time itself, so Old Chu didn't have a chance to respond.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” With lightning speed, Li Qiye removed a bone from Old Chu’s body. At the same moment, the old skeleton seemingly turned into a puppet that was falling apart, scattering all over the ground.</p>
 <p>The sound of bones breaking came about. This bone was shattered completely in Li Qiye’s hand. However, the crushed powder didn’t fall to the ground; it floated in the air and abruptly formed a small black hole.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye stepped inside without any hesitation. When he disappeared, the black hole quickly collapsed. Outside of the bones scattered on the ground, it was as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” When the black hole disappeared completely, the bone that Li Qiye removed came back together and fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Clack, clack, clack!” The sound of bones coming together emerged. The strangest thing happened when that single bone fell to the ground. All the scattered bones reconnected and a complete skeleton was formed.</p>
 <p>Old Chu got up from the ground. He unexpectedly acted just like before by picking up the bell and carrying his big trunk. The bell sounded once more while he shouted away.</p>
 <p>Up in the sky where the white clouds drifted in the distance was a floating palace. Its size was modest, and there was a little pool of water in front of it.</p>
 <p>A person was lying in a wooden chair, basking in the sun. He looked very relaxed and comfortable while drinking his bloodwine — the leisurely life of an immortal.</p>
 <p>To be precise, he resembled the skeleton of a twelve-year-old.</p>
 <p>This skeleton was golden; each bone seemed to be cast from gold. A pair of jewel-like eyes were in its sockets.</p>
 <p>However, the most eye-catching part of this skeleton was not its golden nature or the jewels for its eyes, but the halo above its head.</p>
 <p>This halo was incredibly holy. Others would feel inferior the moment they saw this light and have an urge to prostrate. It looked like the aura of an angel, something capable of cleansing anyone’s mind and dispelling the light of this world. [1. First time seeing angel used in ED, seems a bit out of place. The last sentence was weird too.]</p>
 <p>The idle skeleton suddenly sat up and shouted: “Who is it?!”</p>
 <p>“Buzz.” A black hole opened and Li Qiye walk out in front of this skeleton.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this intruder, the jeweled eyes shot out a bizarre light as it glared at Li Qiye with a serious expression.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, may I have your name?” It cupped its fists after not being able to recognize Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye revealed a friendly smile, flashing his striking white teeth: “I broke your bones last time, yet you don’t remember me? Do I have to do it again?”</p>
 <p>“Fuck!” The skeleton suddenly jumped to the side and threw away its bloodwine while exclaiming: “You’re that damned crow!”</p>
 <p>“You got it.” Li Qiye smiled with his dazzling, perfect teeth. He then sat down in the chair without any reservation and comfortably sighed.</p>
 <p>“You, you snatched back your real body?” The skeleton stared at him in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Yes, this is my real body. I traveled very far to get here, so shouldn’t you be getting the good wine out for a guest like me?” Li Qiye closed his eyes and made himself comfortable.</p>
 <p>This skeleton was Lord Bones, the master of Bones Island. Its origin was unknown. At the very least, less than few people knew of its origin across the eons, but it had always been in charge of this island.</p>
 <p>Lord Bones stared at Li Qiye for a bit before giving up. It went inside the palace to take out more bloodwine and poured a full cup for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye accepted the cup and drank a mouthful before sighing: “You really know how to enjoy life, hiding this stuff all to yourself.”</p>
 <p>Lord Bones replied: “Hah, what else can I do? After being tricked by that bastard Bu Si, I can only hang onto this little life in this place and drink a little bit each day to kill time.”</p>
 <p>“Well, that’s true.” Li Qiye drank some more and nodded.</p>
 <p>“That motherfucker.” Lord Bones started cursing after the past was brought up: “That goddamned bastard! I trusted him so much back then, yet he actually tricked me. Look at me now, I can’t die even if I want to. I have to go through so much trouble each time I want to sneak back.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only laughed at the cursing lord and replied: “Didn’t the brat’s skeletal mount run to the Bonesea? You can sneak back to catch it.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, I’m not in a hurry.” The lord gritted his teeth from anger: “I’m waiting for that brat. If he doesn’t succeed, then forget it. But if he does… Hehe, he better not let me see him or I’ll peel off his skin again and again so that he’ll learn who the boss is. He dared to trick me, so I won’t let him off so easily.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely commented: “I don’t know if you will have the chance.”</p>
 <p>“Of course I will, I’ll take real good care of him.” The lord became quite heated as his murderous intent grew: “It would be a real shame if I don’t let him taste some of the most horrifying methods of torture in this world.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and put down his cup to say: “I’m not interested in asking about your feud with him. If you can torture him, then I’ll applaud for sure. However, I’m here to borrow something from you.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, hahaha.” The lord turned cautious and laughed: “Damned crow, no, Your Great Excellency, don’t joke with a lowly man like me. I am only a wandering ghost, suppressed from above and tortured from below. How could a person like me have anything of interest for someone as amazing as you?”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, you are the ruler of the nine worlds, an eternal god, the sole master of the nine heavens and ten earths. Nothing in this world could enter your sight.” The lord flattered Li Qiye incessantly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but chortle in response: “Bones, your words aren’t reasonable since you really are just hanging onto dear life here. The Bonesea has done too much to you. On top of that brat tricking you back then, it really has been tough on you.”</p>
 <p>Lord Bones continued with his flattery: “Hahaha, Your Excellency, you are still so wise and brilliant. Your insight is matchless.”</p>
 <p>“However…” Li Qiye proceeded with a grin: “You conveniently took out many items from the Bonesea back then. You were supposed to go fifty-fifty with that brat back then, but you greedily took eighty percent instead. You tell me, if the brat didn’t pull a fast one on you, would he have let this go?”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1301: Borrowing A Boat</b></p>
 <p>Lord Bones boisterously laughed after being called out by Li Qiye: “This past was too long ago, I can’t really remember it.”</p>
 <p>A while later, he added: “You know how ruthless the years are. I have spent nearly all of that little wealth while half of my life has been spent stuck in this place.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at this whining skeleton and said: “Don’t try to fool me. You should be praising your fortune that I’m not robbing you clean. Today, I only want to borrow something, yet you’re already crying this much.”</p>
 <p>The skeleton replied with a bitter face: “Your Excellency, this is my lifeblood…” He knew what Li Qiye wanted to borrow, but it was too important to him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye explained: “I’ll return it after I’m done, it’s not like I want to steal your broken boat.”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, it isn’t that I’m unwilling to lend it to you, but you should know that my insignificant life requires this boat to survive. I can’t survive without it, and it isn’t that easy to use. It needs time to recharge after each use.” Lord Bones was still as sad as before.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded: “I understand. If there was another option, I wouldn’t be asking for your broken boat. But don’t worry, this is just a backup plan of mine, I’ll deal with the other things in the Bonesea myself. When I try to cross the restricted area, I’ll use your boat as a last resort without breaking it, I assure you.”</p>
 <p>“You want to go inside?” Bones was startled. He suddenly patted his head and jumped up to say: “It looks like my brain is done for, I’m not as quick-minded as before. That star went straight for the Bonesea, so I should have thought of you first. It’s not the old dragon god, it’s you.”</p>
 <p>Bones had a profound understanding of the Bonesea; he knew what was going on the moment he saw the black star. However, he didn’t expect that it was the Dark Crow himself.</p>
 <p>“Yes. A few things don’t belong there since they belong to me.” Li Qiye nodded.</p>
 <p>“You want the Trident?” After asking, Bones felt that this wasn’t right and immediately corrected himself: “Wait, no. If you wanted the Trident, you would have taken action long ago.”</p>
 <p>His jeweled eyes suddenly flashed with light: “What do you actually want if not this weapon?”</p>
 <p>“You should know the answer to this better than me.” Li Qiye gave a profound smile: “You climbed out of that place, so you should know of the things there.”</p>
 <p>“Well, well… I really don’t remember.” Bones hesitated for a moment and carefully searched his memories. However, despite coming from that place, it had so many secrets and mysteries that even he didn’t understand them all.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and reminded the island lord: “If I’m not mistaken, there is a maelstrom there.”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Lord Bones trembled a bit and took a deep breath: “Are you serious? I haven’t been there before, but I was able to take a glance at it from afar a very long time ago.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye said with a smile: “Across the ages, who has actually been there? Very few have managed this incredible task, such as Immortal Emperor Yan Shi.”</p>
 <p>“I know of that place.” Even a character of Bones’ level became curious, so he asked: “Your Excellency, what do you want from this maelstrom? What can it do?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gave a mysterious smile: “Well, that’s a secret. Plus, it would be pointless even if you find out. Your origin means that it is not meant for you unless you can be like Immortal Emperor Bu Si.”</p>
 <p>“Fuck him. Whenever that bastard comes up, I just want to torture him.” Lord Bones’ anger was rising: “The chance back then should have been mine, but the bastard dared to cheat me!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled: “I don’t care for your enmity with the brat, but maybe you will be able to do something about it in the future.”</p>
 <p>Bones thought about it for a bit. After a while, he took out the boat and gave it to Li Qiye. After Li Qiye put it away, Bones couldn’t help but add with a pained expression: “Your Excellency, take it easy, okay? What you have in your hands is my lifeblood.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye quipped: “Must you be so stingy?”</p>
 <p>Bones immediately showed his pitiful side: “Your Excellency, you are the ruler of the nine firmaments, someone who can call for winds and rains. I am only a lowly character with no wealth at all, so how can I compare to you?!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied: “You don’t have to whine. If I’m successful, you will laugh until your teeth fall out. It will be a great chance for you to make a fortune, there’s no need to sneak back to the Bonesea every once in a while.”</p>
 <p>“Is, is this really going to work?” The island lord’s jeweled eyes suddenly lit up as a hint of excitement could be heard in his voice.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughingly spoke: “If you want to get rich, you better get ready for the harvest.”</p>
 <p>Bones enthusiastically rubbed his palms and said: “If this is true, then I can get my life back.”</p>
 <p>“That’s why I said there’s no point in crying. Letting me borrow this broken ship won’t be your loss.” Li Qiye gave him the side-eye.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, excuse me.” Bones laughed then thought about a different question and had to ask: “Your Excellency, if you actually do this, I’m afraid the Bonesea will flip the sky over.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled in response: “It won’t be that fast. If it could do so, it would have done it long ago. Of course, that day will come eventually.”</p>
 <p>Lord Bones turned quiet before querying: “Is it true that Heaven Spirit really can’t escape this disaster?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye jokingly quipped: “Did I just mishear you? You actually care about Heaven Spirit? Don’t forget, you are dead, do dead people care about the rest of the world?”</p>
 <p>Lord Bones thought for a bit before replying: “Ah, you have brought this up before. Maybe it is because I have lingered on too long in this world, so I’m unavoidably attached to it. It is precisely this reason that many Immortal Emperors didn’t want to leave; their children and descendants are all still here.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nodded after musing in his mind: “As a human, I do not like Heaven Spirit, but I do not deny that it is a really good place. Outside of a few annoying sea demons, it is truly outstanding with talents and sceneries. If I was born here, I’m sure I would have a deep love for this land.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is such a lovable place, even for the dead.” Lord Bones sighed with emotion.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled: “But in the end, Heaven Spirit still has its own destiny. You don’t need to worry, just be ready to run for your life when that day comes, or... heh, you can just imagine the result.”</p>
 <p>“Well, there’s nothing else I can do but run then. Other living beings in Heaven Spirit will just have to pray for themselves.” The lord smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly stated: “That’s just how it is. In Heaven Spirit, humans are rootless duckweeds. The charming spirits, sea demons, and treants all have their own destiny. Many things have been determined long ago.”</p>
 <p>Bones helplessly replied: “The Bonesea will overturn this world one day.”</p>
 <p>“So what? It is not the only power here. If it breaks the balance of Heaven Spirit, the great maelstrom and the Divine Tree Ridge will do the same.”</p>
 <p>“When all three go crazy, wouldn’t the entire world collapse?” Bones’ expression shifted.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “These things aren’t set in stone just yet. The fate of the Heaven Spirit World isn’t only in the hands of a few people. Outside of luck, personal effort matters as well. For millions of years, countless treefathers, sea gods, and Immortal Emperors have tried their best.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe we shouldn’t be so pessimistic for Heaven Spirit, at least for the three great races.” Li Qiye finished with a sentimental sigh: “The only unfortunate race might be the humans.”</p>
 <p>Bones responded: “I can only nag about these matters. If Immortal Emperors can’t do anything about it, then what can I do?”</p>
 <p>“Which is why you just need to get ready. If I’m successful, you can ride my coattails.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “Once you have accumulated enough, the day Heaven Spirit falls into chaos is the day you will be free since your life won’t be chained to here any longer. Use that time to run away.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, makes sense.” Bones became excited: “I haven’t been to other places, so if I get freed... Hehe… I guess I no longer care if Bonesea will go crazy, I’ll be free like the birds in the vast sky and the fish in the wide sea!”</p>
 <p>Just thinking about a future extrication left Bones in eager anticipation and excitement.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1302: Meng Zhentian</b></p>
 <p>After saying goodbye to Lord Bones, Li Qiye returned to Bones Island. He perused the area and let out a sigh before turning to leave.</p>
 <p>The rest of the group was waiting on their gigantic boat. There was another one parked next to them. Its master was Bao Yujiang.</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong was there with him as well, along with many cultivators from all over the oceans.</p>
 <p>“Schoolmaster Zhuo, long time no see.” Bao Yujiang hurriedly greeted Zhuo Jianshi after seeing her.</p>
 <p>Jianshi slightly nodded in response.</p>
 <p>Yujiang’s eyes lit up after seeing her. Of course, any man would palpitate after seeing a woman like her. This was the natural course of life.</p>
 <p>“Schoolmaster Zhuo, would you like to come visit my boat for a while?” Yujiang asked Jianshi with the intention of getting closer to her.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and answered before Jianshi could: “Mind your words.”</p>
 <p>Yujiang’s expression changed after hearing this. The cultivators following him all stared at Li Qiye with strange looks as well.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bao is inviting the schoolmaster, what does that have to do with you?” Mu Shaolong, who was a close friend of Yujiang’s, immediately spoke up for him.</p>
 <p>“I’m in charge of this boat right now.” Li Qiye glanced over at Shaolong and slowly stated: “If you want to live on, stay away from the Dream Empyrean.”</p>
 <p>Both youths were alarmed after hearing this. This was not only offending Shaolong, he was also provoking Yujiang.</p>
 <p>The cultivators nearby didn’t dare to say anything and only took deep breaths. They had all heard of Li Qiye’s notoriety before.</p>
 <p>Shaolong turned cold and said: “Is that so? Have I offended you? But even if I did, so what!”</p>
 <p>He was very confident. His Celestial Pavilion had never been afraid of anyone before despite its low-key nature. They could still rampage in Heaven Spirit regardless of the occasion.</p>
 <p>“While it is true that you haven’t offended me, you should be using your head more.” Li Qiye smiled and pointed at his head: “Don’t embarrass the Mu Clan.”</p>
 <p>“You…” Shaolong wasn’t happy to hear such arrogant words and immediately glared at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, Li Qiye, I know that you are very strong!” Yujiang chimed in at this moment: “But Heaven Spirit isn’t a place for you to do as you please—”</p>
 <p>“I can rampage wherever I want in the nine worlds and myriad realms.” Li Qiye interrupted him with an indifferent tone: “If you’re not convinced, come at me. See if I dare to kill you or not.”</p>
 <p>Such domineering words were incredibly direct and ferocious; they didn’t give Bao Yujiang the slightest bit of face!</p>
 <p>Yujiang’s expression was not pretty at this moment as he glared at Li Qiye. However, he really didn’t want to oppose Li Qiye. After all, this was someone who killed Shangguan Feiyan from the Roaring Conch.</p>
 <p>Without the backing of any seniors and his master not being close, he was no match for Li Qiye. He could only endure this anger.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye ignored Yujiang and turned towards Shaolong: “The Bonesea will be a troubled land. You better go back to your pavilion to avoid being killed.”</p>
 <p>He didn’t care about Shaolong’s response, so after he finished saying what he wanted, he went inside his boat.</p>
 <p>While watching Li Qiye walk away, Yujiang gritted his teeth and coldly uttered: “I want to see just how long you can act arrogant for! Whenever my grandmaster comes out will be your doom!”</p>
 <p>People quivered behind him. Even though Yujiang’s cultivation couldn’t be considered exceptional, he had a grandmaster that could become an Immortal Emperor!</p>
 <p>After Li Qiye sat down in his spot, Ruyan teased with a smile: “Oh? Young Noble, were you jealous?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at her and replied: “Jealous? What’s that?”</p>
 <p>Ruyan blinked and asked: “Then do you have a feud with the Dream Empyrean?”</p>
 <p>“Not to that level.” Li Qiye leisurely replied: “If Meng Zhentian wants to come out for the Heaven’s Will in this generation, he will become bones beneath my feet.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan’s mind shuddered. She understood that Li Qiye will definitely obtain the Heaven’s Will, so she emotionally commented: “The path towards the throne is merciless. I have heard rumours of him coming out as well. It looks like he must have.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye calmly said: “He is simply courting death.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan wryly smiled. Others would never dare to make such a claim. Meng Zhentian was a supreme existence in Heaven Spirit; his emergence was enough to deter the entire world. Experts from all of the nine worlds found him dreadful.</p>
 <p>Heaven Spirit greatly valued him and thought that he would become an emperor. After all, no one among the younger generation could compete against him!</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye spoke of him with such nonchalance that it made him seem as if he was only an ant to be trampled on.</p>
 <p>The thoughtful Jianshi asked: “Oh, Young Noble, do you have ties with the Celestial Pavilion?” She could see that Li Qiye was purposely trying to protect Mu Shaolong.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled. Even though he tried to be considerate out of nostalgia, if Mu Shaolong kept on acting naive, he would kill him even if he was from the Mu Clan!</p>
 <p>Li Qiye closed his eyes and ordered: “To the Bonesea we go.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan immediately commanded her disciples to commence their journey to the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>The black star made many people run to the Bonesea. In fact, people usually visited this place anyway, but this event caused the stream to become more like a surging tide of people. Nearly all the powerful sects were on their way. The experts from previous generations couldn’t miss this opportunity for the artifact of immortality.</p>
 <p>Countless carriages crossed the sky in recent days. Ships and boats made their way through the tides while sea demons traveled in droves…</p>
 <p>They were anxious to arrive as soon as possible. All of them wanted to be the first to obtain the great artifact!</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” On this day, a divine aura engulfed the sky due to the presence of a cavalry. It crushed the void with great martial might just like an experienced imperial legion.</p>
 <p>Though this cavalry were few in number, every single one of them were powerful and had a cold and awe-inspiring presence. Their armor was branded with a supreme insignia.</p>
 <p>This cavalry was only the scouting force, yet it could easily destroy a lineage.</p>
 <p>The click-clack noises of a carriage resounded. The moment this particular carriage appeared, many phenomena emerged in the sky. Laws came down like waterfalls everywhere.</p>
 <p>A path with flashing divine lights that led all the way to the Bonesea was paved by these laws. The carriage slowly traveled forward. Even though it was very far away, its immortal brilliance was far-reaching and turned into many images. Myriad laws were encompassed within; the gods were protecting it while exotic creatures were right behind…</p>
 <p>“Shriek!” A phoenix hymn echoed in the sky. The beast pulling this carriage was a golden phoenix. It looked to be cast from pure gold and had a sharp blade-like gaze capable of cutting through everything.</p>
 <p>However, upon closer inspection, there was a difference between this bird and a real phoenix. Its head was still that of an eagle.</p>
 <p>The carriage was incomparably luxurious with inlaid ancient jades and Immortal Emperor runes. This was a carriage blessed by an emperor, so when it slowly traveled across this world, an imperial aura suppressed the location.</p>
 <p>What was even more frightening was that it was completely surrounded by an alternating Yin and Yang, making it clear that a true master was inside.</p>
 <p>A treant elder was driving the carriage. He didn’t bother hiding his Godking aura at all, emitting a crimson flame capable of scorching the sky vault.</p>
 <p>This was a driver of the Godking level — a truly shocking sight.</p>
 <p>Alas, the most terrifying of all was the aura being exuded from the carriage. Even though no one could see who was inside, this terrifying aura made it seem like an Immortal Emperor sitting in an untouchable throne. Just this aura alone made others want to prostrate in fear. He alone was invincible in this world.</p>
 <p>“Just like an Immortal Emperor…” Juniors were completely frightened by this scene. The suppression of this aura caused the weaker ones to immediately kneel on the ground.</p>
 <p>An older expert saw the insignia and exclaimed: “Meng Zhentian, he really has come into being.”</p>
 <p>“Meng Zhentian!” This name struck everyone’s ears like thunder, shocking them all.</p>
 <p>Even gods and devils would retreat when they heard this name in Heaven Spirit. All masters would definitely show him some respect.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1303: Ever-present Threat</b></p>
 <p>“He really is coming out.” Even a paragon who had been born in the same generation as Meng Zhentian gasped.</p>
 <p>In the past, those who were lucky enough to see him could never forget his invincible disposition. Even if he couldn’t become an emperor, he was still worthy of being admired for a lifetime.</p>
 <p>“The Heaven’s Will now has a master, others shouldn’t think about becoming emperor.” Other geniuses and their seniors were drowning in despair.</p>
 <p>His name, for many people, was the start of a nightmare. Almost all people in Heaven Spirit had heard of him before. They might not know about the powerful Dream Empyrean, but they couldn’t possibly not know Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Legend states that he was born in the same era as Immortal Emperor Ta Kong. The two of them became sworn brothers and developed a deep friendship. It went on to say that Meng Zhentian was unbeatable in his life. Even the emperor in his youth had lost to Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Future generations had always wondered why Meng Zhentian didn’t become an Immortal Emperor. Some said that it was because of his love for his brother. He didn’t want to compete and fight against Immortal Emperor Ta Kong for the Heaven’s Will.</p>
 <p>Others believed that he was one step slower than the emperor and lost the initiative, so he lost the Heaven’s Will.</p>
 <p>Regardless of the reason, his prestige didn’t diminish. Even after becoming an emperor, Immortal Emperor Ta Kong still treated him as an elder brother like before.</p>
 <p>From this point alone, one could see just how powerful and frightening he was.</p>
 <p>Meng Zhentian didn’t become an emperor in the previous generation, but he had now come out with the intention of aiming for the throne in this one. Everyone in Heaven Spirit knew the day of his coming meant that no other genius had a chance of becoming emperor!</p>
 <p>The most alarming thing was that during the previous competition, he didn’t only accumulate enough experience, he gained sufficient strength as well. There were many Godkings under his banner in addition to a formidable legion.</p>
 <p>Other geniuses simply couldn’t compete against such an opponent!</p>
 <p>An old paragon saw the scouting cavalry and exclaimed: “Heaven Suppression Legion, what a domineering name! In the past, outside of Immortal Emperor Ta Kong’s own legion, no one else could compete with it.”</p>
 <p>Just imagine the years past, Meng Zhentian led his legion and swept through the world while defeating every opponent!</p>
 <p>A junior enviously stated while looking at the bird: “That golden phoenix… only an Immortal Emperor would enjoy such treatment.” He dreamed of the day that he could experience this treatment.</p>
 <p>A senior explained: “That’s not a true phoenix, it’s only an eagle with the bloodline of a phoenix. Nevertheless, it is still very rare and strong.”</p>
 <p>A treant recognized the old man driving the carriage. Even while dazed, he managed to murmur: “Isn’t that Ancestor Crimsonflame from our treant race? He, he is already an amazing Grand Godking, why is he driving for Meng Zhentian?”</p>
 <p>“Meng Zhentian is qualified to have this treatment.” A jealous spectator had to admit: “He is the leading candidate to become the next emperor. Once he becomes an emperor, a Grand Godking will be nothing. It would become an honor to be Meng Zhentian’s driver at that point.”</p>
 <p>His appearance shocked the entire Dragon Demon Sea and even Heaven Spirit as a whole. Due to the volume of travelers heading towards the Bonesea, many of them got to saw his divine style with their own eyes. The entire region was in a clamor.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan was walking on the blue waves when the carriage of Meng Zhentian was crossing the sky. Her group saw the frightening scene as well.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi commented with emotion: “The Dream Empyrean is considered the oldest charming spirit lineage. Even though they have never produced an Immortal Emperor, they never had a lack of talents.”</p>
 <p>It was the biggest charming spirit sect in the Dragon Demon Sea and one of the strongest in all of Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>“Even though we are all charming spirits, I have to admit that their divine reflections are unmatched when compared to lineages like ours. They can be praised as supreme.” Even someone as proud as Liu Ruyan had to nod her head in agreement.</p>
 <p>There was a particular saying in the Heaven Spirit World. If the Void Imperfection Three Schools had the best immortal physiques, then the Dream Empyrean had the best divine reflections.</p>
 <p>A divine reflection was a unique talent of charming spirits and varied from one individual to the next. However, disciples who came from the Dream Empyrean were believed to have the best reflections in Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>Their progenitor was Shen Mengtian, the one who created and named the sect after his own name. [1. Shen Mengtian means Divine Dream Heaven — Dream Empyrean.]</p>
 <p>Legend states that when he was still alive, he cultivated his divine reflection beyond all other charming spirits and surpassed the limit. His achievements in this regard were at the very peak.</p>
 <p>Though Shen Mengtian didn't become an emperor in his generation, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Immortal Emperors. Back in that era, some historians believed that even the emperor back then respectfully called him “teacher”.</p>
 <p>Another tale claims that his ultimate divine reflection could see through both the past and future, gazing into the mysteries of this world. Because of this, even Immortal Emperors have had to rely on him at times.</p>
 <p>Jianshi nodded and said: “The Dream Empyrean has the most orthodox and purest bloodline out of all the charming spirits. Because of this, their divine reflection far exceeds that of other charming spirits, it’s not strange at all.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and told the two girls: “Most orthodox and purest? It’s not their turn to receive this praise. In terms of purity and history, this can only belong to the Buzhan Clan. Even though the Dream Empyrean originated from the Spirit Abyss, their bloodline isn’t that pure.”</p>
 <p>“The Buzhan Clan…” Both the sisters glanced at each other. The Buzhan Clan was so ancient as to be untraceable. Only they themselves knew just how old their clan and bloodline was. Maybe even the clan itself didn’t even know all the details.</p>
 <p>“I heard the Buzhan Clan consists of descendants of immortals, far from just having an ancient bloodline.” Ruyan became interested as her pretty eyes blinked: “Young Noble, do you think this rumor is true?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at her and replied: “How are you defining immortal? Are there immortals in this world?”</p>
 <p>This was a very confusing and difficult topic because no one had seen an immortal before.</p>
 <p>Jianshi interjected: “Well, the Celestial Pavilion has been known to house an immortal in the past.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at her and smiled: “Young beauty, are you borrowing your sister’s cunning to try to set me up?”</p>
 <p>Jianshi slightly blushed and lowered her head without answering. Her elegance had a hint of youthfulness this time around.</p>
 <p>“Celestial Pavilion…” Ruyan was much bolder compared to the slightly reserved Jianshi. There was no topic that she would purposely avoid: “Young Noble, you are too nice towards Mu Shaolong. Could it be that you are aiming for the pavilion’s secret, the Immortal Dao City?”</p>
 <p>The low-key Celestial Pavilion was rumored to be attached to one of the nine heavenly treasures, the Immortal Dao City. Outsiders couldn’t confirm this, and the pavilion itself never addressed this question.</p>
 <p>“You are looking down on me too much.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “If I wanted their secret, would I need to start with a junior? I just need to directly ask them, it isn’t difficult at all.”</p>
 <p>“What is your relationship with the pavilion?” Ruyan gave a cute wink that contained boundless grace.</p>
 <p>Both of the girls were quite curious after noticing Li Qiye’s special treatment of Mu Shaolong. After all, he was someone who wouldn’t even bother looking at a young junior of Shaolong’s level.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t reply, he only silently stared at the blue waves in the distance.</p>
 <p>He was worried about many things at the Celestial Pavilion. It was not only due to the Lunargrasp Fairy, some past matters played a part as well.</p>
 <p>It was just as the two girls had said, he had a special spot for the pavilion in his heart. Mu Shaolong’s special treatment wasn’t only because Shaolong had the last name of Mu.</p>
 <p>The two girls were quite curious, but they didn’t dare to pry any further, not even the daring Ruyan.</p>
 <p>At this time, a disciple from outside reported: “Schoolmaster, Young Noble Bao from the Dream Empyrean is requesting to board our boat.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1304: Smugness</b></p>
 <p>After hearing the disciple, Liu Ruyan frowned and thought about why Bao Yujiang might have come here again.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and lightly said: “It looks like he hasn’t given up.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan asked the disciple: “What did he come here for?”</p>
 <p>In terms of status, Yujiang was not qualified to see Ruyan or Jianshi. In fact, his master was barely on the same level as them.</p>
 <p>The disciple hurriedly responded: “He said he is representing the Dream Empyrean to see you, Schoolmaster.”</p>
 <p>“Let him in.” Although Ruyan had no interest in this visit of his, if he was representing the empyrean and she were to refuse an audience, it would make the Void Imperfection Schools seem petty.</p>
 <p>A bit later, Yujiang came with Mu Shaolong beside him. Their friendship was great, so they came to the Bonesea together; they were completely inseparable.</p>
 <p>Yujiang came in and saw Li Qiye. He felt some displeasure since this was the man he didn’t want to see the most. However, this wasn’t his territory, so regardless of his personal annoyance towards Li Qiye, there was no way around it.</p>
 <p>“Schoolmaster Liu, Schoolmaster Zhuo, we meet again.” He cupped his fists and handed over an official letter from the Dream Empyrean.</p>
 <p>The two glanced at the letter and read the header. It was written by Yujiang’s master, Bao Guojian.</p>
 <p>This formal letter meant that it was an official visit and not a personal one from Bao Yujiang.</p>
 <p>Jianshi put the letter away and slowly asked: “May I ask what you are here for?”</p>
 <p>Yujiang replied: “I am here to talk with Schoolmasters about the direction the world will take in the future.”</p>
 <p>Yujiang’s demeanor had drastically changed. He was even more excited and confident, made evident by his imposing momentum. He carried himself as if he was equal to or even above everyone else.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder why he was this emboldened. His grandmaster, Meng Zhentian, had finally emerged to become an emperor. This made him bolder as he walked proudly with a straight posture. [1. I believe I used ancestor in the past for Meng Zhentian when Yujiang was talking. It is because Ancestor and Grandmaster are the same word in Chinese. Now that I have some context, we’ll be using grandmaster.]</p>
 <p>Jianshi smiled gracefully in response to this statement. He made it sound like he was on equal footing with them, like old friends with a deep friendship.</p>
 <p>The “future” he spoke of seemed very threatening, as if he was in control of everything. There was a regal intonation to his speech.</p>
 <p>Of course, Jianshi was an experienced schoolmaster. She didn’t take this kind of posturing to heart.</p>
 <p>She plainly said: “Elaborate.”</p>
 <p>Her insipid reaction left him a bit disappointed. At this moment, he was speaking with so much confidence and charisma that anyone would show him some respect. Alas, a beauty like Jianshi was acting nonchalantly, as if it was no big deal, making him feel a bit lost.</p>
 <p>He calmed down and replied: “Schoolmaster Zhuo, Schoolmaster Liu, my master entrusted me with discussing an alliance with you two. Our Dream Empyrean is willing to stand together with the Void Imperfection Three Schools in order to create a flourishing world.”</p>
 <p>The two girls understood what he meant right away. This so-called alliance was only in name. Meng Zhentian wanted the Heaven’s Will, so he had the ambition to fight the rest of the nine worlds.</p>
 <p>As for Bao Guojian, his ambition must also be burning. If he could sway an imperial lineage like Void Imperfect or young geniuses like Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi to become legion generals for his master in the future, his status would soar in the sect and ultimately, the world.</p>
 <p>“You want us to work for your grandmaster?” She gave a charming smile, but there was a chilling touch in her voice.</p>
 <p>Even if Meng Zhentian wanted to become an emperor and recruit their sect, Bao Yujiang wouldn’t be qualified to be the messenger.</p>
 <p>However, Yujiang was feeling quite complacent, apparent by his smug appearance. He didn't hear the cold implication in her voice and quickly said: “Schoolmaster Liu, if you become my grandmaster’s general, your future will be even more brilliant. You will have a great position alongside Schoolmaster Zhuo in all the nine worlds…”</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang was elated with pride. He thought he had managed to convince the two of them.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye quietly sat there and watched this recruitment play out. He smiled and eventually dozed off as he was too lazy to reason with him.</p>
 <p>Jianshi faintly smiled while an amused glimmer flashed in Ruyan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>If Meng Zhentian himself said these words, they would certainly take it more seriously. However, Yujiang was too weak to make such promises. He didn’t have the clout to persuade these two.</p>
 <p>Even if Meng Zhentian were to become the next emperor, the Void Imperfection Three Schools was a behemoth in Heaven Spirit. They couldn’t be lobbied this easily by a junior like Bao Yujiang.</p>
 <p>After Yujiang finished speaking, Jianshi shook her head in response: “Our sect appreciates your good intentions. However, our schools do not care for competition and power in the nine worlds. Please return and tell Daoist Cao that we accept his kind gesture. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to comply.”</p>
 <p>Yujiang grew anxious after hearing the swift refusal. He thought for a bit and said: “Schoolmasters, you shouldn’t reject such an important matter this quickly. You should talk it through with the elders of your schools before making a decision. If you don’t mind, come visit our Dream Empyrean before deciding.”</p>
 <p>Yujiang didn’t only want to succeed and complete this task for his master. He also wanted to use this opportunity to get close to the two beauties if they were to accept the recruitment.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi were supreme beauties with no lack of admirers in the Heaven Spirit World. In the past, Yujiang knew his own limits. It wasn’t his turn to get close to these kingdom-toppling beauties.</p>
 <p>But now was a different story. The moment his grandmaster becomes an emperor, he would become an imperial granddisciple. His worth would soar a hundred-fold. At that point, he would be on the same level as the Profound Monarch and Seashield Prince.</p>
 <p>If Ruyan and Jianshi were to truly become his grandmaster’s generals, then he — as the imperial granddisciple — would be able to ride his coattails.</p>
 <p>“There is nothing to negotiate, please leave.” Ruyan was much more direct than Jianshi with her response.</p>
 <p>Even if their schools had ambition, they wouldn’t necessarily join the Dream Empyrean or highly value Meng Zhentian. On the other hand, they were much more optimistic about the mysterious Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Schoolmaster Liu, you shouldn’t decline so quickly. You really should reconsider.” Mu Shaolong chimed in: “Senior Meng will become an Immortal Emperor, so forming an alliance with the Dream Empyrean will surely benefit Void Imperfection.”</p>
 <p>Even though Shaolong and Yujiang hadn’t made a pact of brotherhood, their friendship was just as strong. Because of this, Shaolong was willing to help him.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Schoolmasters, there is no harm in thinking it over.” Bao Yujiang busily added: “You two should come visit my Dream Empyrean, we will show you our sincerity—”</p>
 <p>But before he could finish, his mouth slowly stopped. His eyes were instantly attracted, and the same went for Mu Shaolong.</p>
 <p>Fairy came out from inside with her matchless temperament, instantly drawing the two in.</p>
 <p>They looked as if they were struck by lightning and couldn’t focus at all. It was not enough to call Fairy the number one beauty in the nine worlds, so of course these two would be intoxicated the moment they saw her.</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong’s mind returned. He seemed to have forgotten about everything else as he quickly stood up to come before Fairy: “My name is Mu Shaolong from the Celestial Pavilion. May I ask for your name, Goddess?”</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang couldn’t endure it either. He was enamored and didn’t want to lose: “I am Bao Yujiang, hailing from the Dream Empyrean. My grandmaster is Meng Zhentian. To be able to meet a goddess like you is a blessing of three lifetimes...”</p>
 <p>Jianshi and Ruyan both laughed after seeing their behavior. They knew all too well just how irresistible Fairy was. Yujiang and Shaolong were ordinary men, so they naturally couldn’t resist her charm.</p>
 <p>Fairy glanced at them with the same dazed expression and then sat down next to Li Qiye without caring for the two.</p>
 <p>This was not due to her arrogance. In fact, ever since she woke up from the coffin, she had been like this, maintaining an indifferent attitude towards everyone except Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Yujiang was immediately filled with jealousy after seeing her next to him. Li Qiye’s special relationship with Ruyan and Jianshi was already enraging enough, but now, this peerless goddess was acting incredibly close to Li Qiye as well. He was going crazy with jealousy.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1305: A Single Stomp</b></p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang gathered his wits and quickly turned over to look at Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan with cupped fists: “Schoolmaster Zhuo, Schoolmaster Liu, is this lady a disciple from your school?”</p>
 <p>Ruyan had a smile that wasn’t a smile while Jianshi only elegantly chuckled and stared at Li Qiye. [1. An idiom — like a smirk that doesn’t show teeth. Just a slight perching from the corner of the lips or cheeks.]</p>
 <p>Yujiang swiftly offered a proposal: “How about this? This miss can come to the Dream Empyrean as a guest. She can observe our sect and have the chance to see our sincerity for this alliance…”</p>
 <p>Mu Shaolong became anxious as well and added his own suggestion: “Schoolmasters, the doors of the Celestial Pavilion will always be open for the Void Imperfection Schools—”</p>
 <p>“Alright, stop acting so shamelessly before me. Return from whence you came.” Li Qiye took the initiative to respond before the two girls had the chance.</p>
 <p>This abrupt interruption wasn’t well-received by the two boys. They were too fascinated by Fairy at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye, I’m not bothering you, so you should do the same.” Yujiang’s stance was quite tough as he coldly uttered: “This is business between the Dream Empyrean and the Void Imperfection Schools…”</p>
 <p>“I’m in charge here.” Li Qiye interrupted him once more: “If you choose to conduct yourself in such a shameful manner, then you might as well scram.”</p>
 <p>“You!” Yujiang was furious as he glared at Li Qiye with fiery eyes. Rarely did he ever get accused and scolded like this. Moreover, who would dare to do so now that his grandmaster had come into being?!</p>
 <p>Even though Shaolong was not as enraged as Yujiang, he also coldly stated: “Li Qiye, even if you are in charge here, you can’t act this imperiously. We are talking to the Void Imperfection Schools, you are not part of it…”</p>
 <p>Yujiang sneered: “That’s right. Li, though you are used to being tyrannical everywhere else, it is best that you open your eyes. It is no longer the same, even supreme geniuses must tuck their tails between their legs for it is my grandmaster’s era now—”</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Li Qiye’s response was straightforward. Before Yujiang could finish, he simply stomped the youth down into the ground, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood!</p>
 <p>Yujiang shouted while being trampled upon: “Li, you, if you dare to hurt me, my grandmaster will not let you go…”</p>
 <p>“Crack!” Li Qiye exerted more force to break the boy’s bones, causing more blood to gush out from his mouth. He could no longer speak as his face reddened.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye, you are acting out of line!” Shaolong angrily shouted and tried to save Yujiang.</p>
 <p>However, the gap between the two parties was too great. He couldn’t do anything before being gripped by the neck and suspended in the air.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye coldly stared at him and said: “It is good to make friends with outsiders, but open your dog eyes wide and understand who you can and can’t afford to provoke! Don’t throw away your clan’s reputation! The Mu has been wise for many generations, don’t let them down through your own foolishness!”</p>
 <p>Shaolong was not convinced and cried: “What, what does it have to do with you! My Mu Clan has nothing to do with you, I’ll do what I want!”</p>
 <p>“Slap!” Li Qiye mercilessly slapped him, but Mu Shaolong still didn’t give up, so he added ten more. The boy’s face was completely swollen like a pig’s head.</p>
 <p>“Mouth off against me and I’ll break your legs then beat you until even your parents won’t be able to recognize you.” Li Qiye maintained his glare.</p>
 <p>When his gaze became this chilling, Shaolong finally felt fear since he understood that Li Qiye was a man of his word.</p>
 <p>After being slapped beyond recognition, Shaolong kept his mouth closed and didn’t dare to talk back.</p>
 <p>“Pop!” Li Qiye threw him on the deck and stated: “Scram back to the Celestial Pavilion. If you keep prancing around in front of me, I’ll personally kill you sooner or later!”</p>
 <p>Shaolong could only scowl. Despite his unwillingness, he didn’t have the courage to retort. He felt indignant and shamed after being scared by Li Qiye. In the end, he couldn’t help but murmur: “I’m, I’m not afraid of you!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye cruelly threatened: “You don’t need to be afraid of me. Just run back to the Mu Clan and start acting sensibly, or else I’ll rip your skin off.”</p>
 <p>“If you, you think you’re so capable, then come to my Celestial Pavilion, we aren’t afraid of you!” Shaolong finally talked back.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye burst out in laughter after hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Pa! Pa!” Li Qiye slapped him twice more.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was truly ruthless this time; two teeth came out of Shaolong’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“Fool!” The smile disappeared on Li Qiye’s face, leaving only a cold visage behind: “Only an idiot like you would use your sect as a threat! You think I’m afraid of the pavilion? If I go there and give you a beating, your ancestors would have to obediently watch on the sidelines!”</p>
 <p>“Stop, stop your ludicrous ravings!” Shaolong was still stubborn: “My pavilion isn’t afraid of you! I dare you to go act arrogantly there, you won’t be able to come out! My matriarch can crush you with one hand!”</p>
 <p>“You mean the Lunargrasp Fairy?” Li Qiye looked at him with disdain.</p>
 <p>“That’s right! Hmph, even if you are stronger than me, many others are stronger than you. You are nothing compared to our matriarch!” Shaolong became tenacious at this moment.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye revealed a cold smile and said: “Very well, go back and tell the Lunargrasp Fairy that Li Qiye from Mount Qilian wants to see her.”</p>
 <p>“Why, why should she grant you an audience?!” Shaolong grew a bit uncertain, but he remained steady.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye demanded: “You don’t have the guts to see your own ancestors? Go back and tell them.”</p>
 <p>With that, he kicked Shaolong flying into the ocean, issuing a loud splash.</p>
 <p>At this time, he turned his focus towards Bao Yujiang beneath his foot and indifferently spoke: “One does not kill the messenger even in times of war. You are lucky that I won’t kill you. Scram. Show your face again and you will meet your maker.”</p>
 <p>He kicked Yujiang away as well. Yujiang’s body turned into a shooting star and disappeared into the horizon.</p>
 <p>Shaolong eventually got out of the sea and hovered in the sky while shouting: “Fine, Li Qiye! You, you win this time! Remember what you have done, I, I will tell them your message!”</p>
 <p>In fact, he was completely scared at this moment, but his mouth kept on running.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat down and chuckled, ignoring the boy.</p>
 <p>Shaolong couldn’t do anything else, so he ran away. He didn’t want to be slapped again.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you have too much patience for the Mu Clan.” Ruyan charmingly smiled after Shaolong’s departure.</p>
 <p>From Li Qiye’s actions, anyone with a pair of eyes would find it as clear as day. Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at Bao Yujiang from the Dream Empyrean; it was as if he was only an ant. However, it was completely different for Mu Shaolong.</p>
 <p>Though he didn’t show any mercy in his beating, it carried good intentions.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at Ruyan and chuckled: “The Celestial Pavilion does indeed have some ties with me.”</p>
 <p>With that, he didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to oppose the Lunargrasp Fairy?” Jianshi asked with concern: “Even though the world believes that Meng Zhentian will become the next emperor, I heard my ancestors say that if the fairy comes out and wants the throne, even Zhentian will have to stand to the side.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan added: “The lifelong rival of Empress Hong Tian, as beautiful as a fairy. I would like to see her...”</p>
 <p>There were too many legends about her in Heaven Spirit. She had lived for such a long time that the moment she came out, her prestige would overwhelm even Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye remained quiet with his eyes closed, refusing to respond to the two.</p>
 <p>After a while, the confused Fairy asked: “Where are we going?” She seemed to be lost in thought all the time; no one knew what was on her mind.</p>
 <p>“The Bonesea.” Li Qiye looked at her and answered: “That place will help you remember. Maybe you will even get something good.”</p>
 <p>“The Bonesea.” Fairy tilted her head as if she was trying to remember something, but it was only an ephemeral flash that she couldn’t grasp.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, you’ll find that this is a place worth visiting.” Li Qiye gently stroked her hair.</p>
 <p>She nodded while contemplating his words.</p>

 <p>The boat of the Evil Devourer School continued onward. Because Li Qiye was not in a hurry, its speed was quite slow. Many cultivators from behind surpassed them.</p>
 <p>Today, it suddenly stopped.</p>
 <p>After noticing the situation, Ruyan asked: “What happened?”</p>
 <p>A disciple immediately reported: “Schoolmaster, someone is in our way and won’t let us pass.”</p>
 <p>“Who is in our way?” Ruyan frowned and thought about some possibilities. Not too many people in Heaven Spirit would dare to stop the Void Imperfection School.</p>
 <p>“Sima Yujian from the Swiftdao Holy Land.” The disciple revealed the name.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Ruyan and Jianshi looked at each other before going outside.</p>
 <p>There was a girl standing above the blue sea. The ocean seemed to be freezing due to her presence. She emitted a chilling aura that spread throughout the entire region. Anyone would shiver after sensing this cold and heartless aura.</p>
 <p>She looked very young, even younger than Zhuo Jianshi. Her gray dress was very simple without any adornments.</p>
 <p>Her simplicity was different from others. It was a style that rendered everything superfluous, like a weapon for murder without any unnecessary parts.</p>
 <p>Her hair draped over her shoulder as she wore an ice-cold expression. Her gaze infiltrated the soul. Upon closer inspection, one could see a fiery bloodthirst surging deep in her pupils. Anyone would quiver when staring into her eyes.</p>
 <p>In terms of coldness, Li Shuangyan and Bai Jianzhen were both cold. However, there was a distinction.</p>
 <p>Li Shuangyan was an apricot flower standing strong amidst a blizzard while Bai Jianzhen was like the chill of steel. Meanwhile, this girl had a frigid ruthlessness capable of killing anything and everything. She was the sharpest edge that could penetrate someone’s heart at any moment.</p>
 <p>With an oval face and clear complexion, she was actually quite beautiful. The sparkle of her eyes made them seem like gems and her lips were as red as flames. Her features made others think of a particular phrase — a beauty was as precious as jade.</p>
 <p>Moreover, her figure was also excellent. Her exquisite curves were clear with a single glance. She had a tight belt that accentuated her figure even more, especially her plump breasts and round buttocks. It was a sight that brightens the eyes.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, people wouldn’t notice her pretty face due to the murderous intent being exuded from her body. Many would retreat instead of approach.</p>
 <p>Her bloodthirst overshadowed her beauty.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators would actually take the long way around or simply observe from a distance when she was around.</p>
 <p>“Sima Yujian!” Some from the Abyss Sea were alarmed to see her.</p>
 <p>“The most famous assassin in Heaven Spirit, and the youngest one at that!” People were shocked after hearing her name.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi came out and saw the girl. Ruyan’s eyes glimmered as she murmured: “Sima Yujian...”</p>
 <p>This was a name that would instill shivers into the heart of listeners.</p>
 <p>A charming spirit spoke: “A genius with incredible potential. What a shame that she chose the path of assassination.”</p>
 <p>Another cultivator from the Abyss Sea felt regretful as well: “The Swiftdao Holy Land should have had two wondrous geniuses. What a pity.”</p>
 <p>Yujian came from an imperial lineage, the Swiftdao Holy Land. Her talents were exceedingly high. After joining the sect, her cultivation suddenly flourished. In this aspect alone, few youths in Heaven Spirit could compare to her.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, someone else started cultivating even faster than her later on — her junior brother, the Swiftdao Celestial God.</p>
 <p>Rumor has it that his cultivation speed broke all records, even exceeding their own progenitor, Immortal Emperor Su Dao! [1. Su Dao = Swiftdao.]</p>
 <p>She who basked in the glory met someone who was even faster than her in cultivation. The two began to compete for the seat of sect master of the holy land. Ultimately, Yujian lost to her junior brother.</p>
 <p>Keep in mind that during this bout, Yujian had already embarked on the path of the heavens at the realm of Dao Sovereign.</p>
 <p>After her defeat, she left the holy land right away. Even though she didn’t cut ties with it, some say that she never returned afterward.</p>
 <p>When she showed up again as an assassin, she had an entirely different image in the eyes of the world. A formidable one she was; in just one night, she killed eight famous big shots.</p>
 <p>People started saying that after her departure, she created a supreme grand dao, one of emotionless murder. Because of this, she had turned into an assassin.</p>
 <p>In the cultivation world, few people were willing to become assassins, especially those who could reach the Virtuous Paragon realm. The reason was that at that level, they would enjoy prestige and fame. Why would they choose to become something with a bad reputation like an assassin?</p>
 <p>Every single assassination attempt from her was successful. In the past, she was already famous, but now, her success only amplified her fame.</p>
 <p>“Miss Sima, what are you here for?” Jianshi asked despite knowing that it wouldn’t be anything pleasant.</p>
 <p>Yujian coldly uttered: “I want to see Li Qiye.” Her voice was chilling to the bones as her murderous intent seeped into the sea water.</p>
 <p>With her amorous and seductive aura, Ruyan chuckled in response: “May I ask why you want to see him?”</p>
 <p>Despite her charming posture and careless appearance, she was very cautious at this moment.</p>
 <p>Jianshi shared the same mindset, but this didn’t mean that they were afraid of Yujian. After all, it was easy to avoid a spear in the open compared to an arrow from the dark.</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian was truly a terrifying assassin, so even the two of them walked the path of prudence.</p>
 <p>“To kill him.” Yujian was direct as her bloodthirst soared.</p>
 <p>Jianshi and Ruyan glanced at each other after hearing this frank response. The spectators in the distance also trembled with cold sweat running down their backs.</p>
 <p>“How fierce, challenging a monster like Li Qiye.” The crowd was startled to hear such a direct challenge.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s infamy couldn’t be any greater. Few from the younger generation would dare to challenge him, let alone declaring their intention to kill him.</p>
 <p>“In terms of cultivation, Yujian is no match for the Swiftdao God, but if she wants to assassinate someone, then it is a different story. Two years ago, the Seaweed Monarch from the Jade Sea was assassinated by her.”</p>
 <p>A sect master from the Jade Sea elaborated: “The Seaweed Monarch was a True Monarch. He was prepared for her, but he was still killed in the end.”</p>
 <p>“It wasn’t just him either.” An information seller added: “The death of the White-whale Godking has something to do with her too.”</p>
 <p>“But he’s a Grand Godking, how could she have killed him?” Many people were skeptical of this claim.</p>
 <p>“Of course she wouldn’t be a match for him in a direct confrontation, but assassination is different.” The seller stated his own opinion.</p>
 <p>There were six different levels for Godkings: Grand Godking, Heavenly Godking, Supreme Godking, Apex Godking, Dominating Godking, and Nine Worlds Godking.</p>
 <p>On the side, Ruyan chuckled a bit after hearing Yujian’s response: “Young Noble Li is our guest. If you want to harm him, you will have to get past us first.”</p>
 <p>Yujian coldly glanced at her and mercilessly said: “As long as someone pays, I won’t mind killing you two as well.”</p>
 <p>“So you’re saying that someone paid you to kill me.” A leisurely voice sounded as Li Qiye came out from inside.</p>
 <p>“Fierce is here.” Many people shouted after seeing him. His fame was no lesser than Sima Yujian’s.</p>
 <p>Her eyes were instantly fixated on him. They emitted a terrifying glint as if they could penetrate his body.</p>
 <p>Many people felt their bodies being pierced by razor-sharp swords under her sweeping glance. However, Li Qiye didn’t care at all.</p>
 <p>He looked at her and smiled: “I’m actually curious, who paid for my life?”</p>
 <p>He looked very nonchalant, as if he was talking about the weather. He didn’t show any signs of the fact that Yujian was here to take his life. Other people would be scared to death and drop to the ground or act quite cautious.</p>
 <p>“Can’t say.” Yujian coldly replied: “I’ll come for your life in three days!”</p>
 <p>The crowd was astonished. Her actions demonstrated her great confidence. In fact, this was her typical style, informing people before killing them…</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1307: Darkcorpse Evil Water</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head after listening to Yujian. He replied: “Such a vulgar action, hiring an assassin. Okay, I don’t care who wants to buy my life, I’ll pay you ten times more. What do you want, Immortal Emperor Refined Jades, imperial weapons, or supreme manuals? Just say the word.”</p>
 <p>The crowd was dumbfounded after hearing this. Everyone thought someone as fierce as Li Qiye would immediately erupt in anger upon finding out that someone wanted his life. A fight would then ensue.</p>
 <p>No one expected for him to act as if he could smash someone to death with just money. He directly mentioned Immortal Emperor Refined Jades and imperial weapons. This youth was far too rich, he really could kill someone with wealth at any moment!</p>
 <p>Yujian coldly said: “The buyer has already made the payment.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shook his head: “No problem, everything is negotiable in business. Just tell me what you want. I don’t need you to tell me who the buyer was, you just have to kill him. I’ll repay this lowly act in the same manner. Tell those who want my life that I have too much money and will pay ten times what they can afford.”</p>
 <p>Many were speechless. This was completely contrary to their image of Li Qiye being a warmonger. Right now, he was acting like a young master who had just fallen into wealth and wanted to show off his money.</p>
 <p>Yujian didn’t agree with his request; instead, she coldly uttered: “Prepare for your funeral, I’ll take your life three days later.”</p>
 <p>“Fine, if you want my life, why wait? Take it now.” Li Qiye smiled and suddenly teleported behind her before finishing his sentence.</p>
 <p>He was way too fast. The majority of the crowd didn’t see how he got behind her.</p>
 <p>In this split second, Yujian also took action. Her sword silently flashed like a scorpion delivering a fatal sting under the guise of night.</p>
 <p>This sword glint was incomparably fast as it aimed for Li Qiye’s chest.</p>
 <p>There was no technique behind it, only pure murderous intent. This direct prick could pierce through his abdominal cavity.</p>
 <p>She might be fast, but he was even faster. His two fingers immediately clamped the blade. However, this flashing edge seemed to have a life of its own as it jumped up to evade him.</p>
 <p>Just like that, it pierced through his clothes and made contact with his flesh. A section of his skin was revealed.</p>
 <p>The sword move didn’t make full contact with him; Yujian immediately retreated with extreme speed the moment Li Qiye’s skin was exposed. The sky was filled with her shadows, no one could tell which was real or fake.</p>
 <p>“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smiled at this scene. He stretched out his palm.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” A black hole emerged as Li Qiye’s vitality soared. The black hole expanded as if it wanted to devour this whole region.</p>
 <p>Heaven Devourer Evil Fist! This fist could devour all existences in the world with its tyrannical power of absorption. Once locked onto by this attack, no one would be able to escape.</p>
 <p>The shadows in the sky couldn’t escape, all was devoured by the black hole. In the end, only one shadow was left. She flew away from the black hole like a ray of light with incredible speed, successfully fleeing.</p>
 <p>“How far can you run?” Li Qiye laughed while watching the fleeing girl. He took a single step on the ocean and traveled a thousand miles in order to capture her.</p>
 <p>“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” He was right behind her when countless arrows shot out from the void. These arrows were quite fast as they penetrated the fabric of space. One could hear space being torn apart by their barrage.</p>
 <p>The terrifying aspect of these arrows wasn’t their speed, it was their material. They were made from refined white bones and carried an extremely terrifying corpse energy. The type of miasma trailing from these arrows was the real weapon.</p>
 <p>This energy held great destructive force and was capable of killing everything in its path. One could easily tell that they were crafted from some horrifying skeletons. Once hit, even if the impact didn’t kill the enemy outright, the corrosive force of this corpse energy would destroy the body and true fate.</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian came prepared without a doubt. She had come up with a path of retreat and laid these arrows beforehand.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye against this oncoming onslaught. He casually pointed forward and space rippled. Even though Li Qiye was standing right there, the spectators started seeing a strange illusion.</p>
 <p>The space surrounding him seemed to be liquefying. The fast arrows were going through this watery space right for Li Qiye, but strangely enough, they didn’t make contact with his body.</p>
 <p>After they reached his flesh, Li Qiye’s body suddenly turned into air as space was restored to its initial form. The arrows all disappeared as if they were never shot in the first place.</p>
 <p>This was space displacement, a technique from one of the four space controlling arts of the Space Scripture. It could move space around in the blink of an eye. Because of this, all of the arrows failed to hit Li Qiye’s body since they were transferred to a different space.</p>
 <p>With this opportunity, Yujian decisively escaped even further away, not daring to stop for a second.</p>
 <p>The space Li Qiye was standing on suddenly lost all gravity. With a strange noise, a drop of water floated up from the sea.</p>
 <p>A drop of seawater shouldn’t be special at all, but the moment this drop touched Li Qiye, it wrapped around him completely. Moreover, this single droplet immediately became huge. It sealed his body completely and began to slowly petrify him in a block of amber.</p>
 <p>At first, everyone thought that this was another trap left behind by Sima Yujian. However, they felt that something was amiss because Yujian was nowhere to be found. If this was another attack from her, she wouldn’t have escaped this quickly.</p>
 <p>Jianshi was startled and immediately warned Li Qiye: “Watch out, this is the Darkcorpse Evil Water!”</p>
 <p>“Hehehe, you are indeed a schoolmaster. How knowledgeable, to be able to recognize my ultimate treasure.” A gloomy laughter resounded at this moment.</p>
 <p>Continuous splashing noises came from the water. Next, a person with a sinister smile surfaced from the sea.</p>
 <p>The moment people saw who it was, they shivered in fear due to his horrific appearance. The man had a big, round fish head with many thorns protruding from it like needles.</p>
 <p>Despite having a human body, many tentacles branched off from his body. These tentacles were very small, only around three to five inches long, so they looked like extra lumps of meat.</p>
 <p>These lumps were all moving, instilling chills into the spines of the spectators. Moreover, they were as black as ink with poisonous juices leaking out.</p>
 <p>A schoolmaster recognized who he was and exclaimed in horror: “Thornspur Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>“Thornspur Ancestor?” Some people had never seen him before, but they had heard of this name: “That’s the man whose body is poisonous through and through, right?”</p>
 <p>“Hehehe, I haven’t been out all these years, yet someone still remembers my name.” The Thornspur Ancestor was happily feeding off the fear of others with a smug expression.</p>
 <p>Thornspur belonged to a branch of sea demons, an extremely rare branch. Members of this branch were born with toxic bodies. Anyone who made contact with them would be poisoned to death unless they were strong enough to withstand the toxins.</p>
 <p>Because of this characteristic, they could kill in secrecy. Thornspur was special among them. He himself was a Virtuous Paragon and had killed many great characters in the past with his poison.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, Junior, you might be strong, but there is no escape from my Darkcorpse Evil Water.” The ancestor stared at Li Qiye trapped in the bubble and deviously laughed: “Blame the person who paid the high price for your life. I’ll turn you into amber before going to collect my bounty!”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” After the ancestor’s gloating, Li Qiye unexpectedly went outside of the water that was sealing him. No one saw how he escaped.</p>
 <p>“How?!” Thornspur was completely stunned and aghast.</p>
 <p>“Trying to seal me with such a petty trick?” Li Qiye sneered. After training with the Space Scripture, not to mention this type of water, even the most heaven-defying sealing technique would find it prohibitively difficult to imprison him.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1308: Provocation</b></p>
 <p>The Thornspur Ancestor was shocked at the failed suppression and knew that the situation had gone sour. He turned to flee because he knew of Li Qiye’s fierce reputation.</p>
 <p>He initially wanted to ambush Li Qiye with his most terrifying Darkcorpse Evil Water, but after failing, he didn’t dare to linger here any longer.</p>
 <p>“Stay and play.” Li Qiye suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>The frightened ancestor immediately changed directions and fled towards the horizon, but he couldn’t escape. Li Qiye blocked his path again. The ancestor shifted once more, but Li Qiye was much faster in stopping him.</p>
 <p>The ancestor’s expression turned unsightly. He knew that his speed was inferior to Li Qiye's, so escaping was impossible. He could only risk it all at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Since you can’t run, you might as well die.” Li Qiye laughed and declared after seeing that the ancestor had given up on running.</p>
 <p>With that, his finger aimed straight for the ancestor. It was just a very casual touch without any destructive force.</p>
 <p>The ancestor didn’t try to dodge and instead rushed forward. It was as if he had become suicidal and wanted to be pierced by this finger.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” Unsurprisingly, Li Qiye’s finger pierced the ancestor’s chest.</p>
 <p>Many people were confused by his actions and the intended consequences.</p>
 <p>“Not good, Li Qiye fell into the trap. You can’t touch the Thornspur Ancestor, his entire body is poisonous.” An older cultivator reacted right away with a shout.</p>
 <p>Although being pierced left him with unbearable pain, the ancestor still gave a devious smile with a gloating demeanor: “Hehehe… Little animal, you are truly strong, but you will still die to me. Even if you are a God-Monarch, you won’t be able to survive. The poison from my body is a hundred times stronger than the external ones I can create.”</p>
 <p>The crowd was dumbfounded after hearing this. They knew that he was poisonous, but not to this extent.</p>
 <p>“It really was a trap.” An old cultivator murmured: “If his natural poison is really that strong, it will be insufferable even if Li Qiye could escape death.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was not surprised at all. He chuckled in response: “This is considered acute poison? What a joke, you think this can kill me?”</p>
 <p>The gloating ancestor suddenly stopped after seeing that Li Qiye was just fine standing there. He cried out: “Impossible!”</p>
 <p>“Nothing is impossible in this world.” Li Qiye smiled. He cultivated the Void Imperfection Physique, so even if this poison was stronger, it wouldn’t hurt him in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Having said that, he slammed his palm into the ancestor’s chest. The palm became infinitely dazzling as if he was holding a sun.</p>
 <p>“Ah—” The ancestor screamed pitifully. His chest was being incinerated, then his entire body turned to ashes.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t escape at all since this scorching fire torched him in a split second.</p>
 <p>Extreme Yang Fist. The ancestor’s poison trap backfired on him. He allowed Li Qiye to get close only to be burned by Li Qiye’s fist.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye patted his palms clean and flatly said: “Trying to kill me at your level?”</p>
 <p>Many cultivators on the sea surface were alarmed after seeing this and quietly stared at each other.</p>
 <p>They had heard of Li Qiye’s reputation and he lived up to it today. A poisonous creature like the Thornspur Ancestor was easily annihilated by him. Even the frightening Sima Yujian almost got killed as well.</p>
 <p>They trembled and thought about staying away from him in the future in order to avoid an indignant death.</p>
 <p>After Li Qiye returned to the boat, Ruyan ordered her disciples to embark on their journey once more.</p>
 <p>“Sima Yujian then the Thornspur Ancestor...” Jianshi spoke after Li Qiye sat down: “The bounty must be very high for people like them to take action. Not many can afford this price in Heaven Spirit.”</p>
 <p>“It’s no big deal.” Li Qiye smiled a little without a care in the world. In fact, he had a pretty good idea of who placed the bounty on his head.</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled and added: “Wealth moves the heart and bounty invites brave people to accept challenges.”</p>
 <p>“That’s fine, the more the merrier. Killing a few hundred thousand will only be a warm-up.” Such a casual remark left the two girls silent.</p>
 <p>For cultivators, killing was a way of life in order to improve. However, Li Qiye’s style of murder was different as shown by his earlier conquests. Calling him Fierce was a polite way to put it since he was more of a butcher.</p>
 <p>“Sima Yujian is actually a bit interesting.” Li Qiye commented while the two girls had wry smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>Jianshi replied: “She is indeed a rare genius. Unfortunately, she was born in the wrong generation, having to meet her junior brother and master. Otherwise, she would be the current sect master of the Swiftdao Holy Land.”</p>
 <p>“If she had stayed at the holy land and the Swiftdao God didn’t exist, maybe she would have been the youngest person to be recognized by the Heaven’s Will in Heaven Spirit.” Ruyan chuckled and added: “Her talents are incredible, plus that holy land is known for its cultivation speed, making her a tiger with wings.”</p>
 <p>The Swiftdao Holy Hand was created by Immortal Emperor Su Dao. He didn’t have as many eternal tales as the other emperors, but he created a supreme grand dao, allowing for the fastest cultivation speed in this world.</p>
 <p>It could be said that under the same conditions and aptitudes, cultivating his emperor law would double the speed of other emperor laws or more. This was the reason why their disciples improved much faster than those of any other lineage.</p>
 <p>“I’m talking about her assassination arts.” Li Qiye smiled.</p>
 <p>“Assassination arts?” Jianshi asked: “Young Noble, do you know the origin of her tactics?”</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian had never returned after leaving the holy land. By the time she showed herself again, she had already become a frightening assassin. People said that from that day onward, she stopped using merit laws from the holy land. Because of this, many believed that she had created a supreme dao of assassination.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only smiled without responding.</p>
 <p>At this point, the boat suddenly stopped again.</p>
 <p>Ruyan frowned and asked her disciples: “What is it this time?”</p>
 <p>A disciple came in and reported with a strange expression: “Something, something is happening outside.”</p>
 <p>She inquired: “What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>The disciple hesitated and glanced over at Li Qiye, but he didn’t know how to phrase his words. Eventually, he stammered: “Some, someone has put a sign in the ocean.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye noticed his demeanor and smiled before walking outside.</p>
 <p>There was a floating buoy with a particular message: “Li Qiye will die if he goes this way!”</p>
 <p>There was also an arrow above the words pointing forward.</p>
 <p>They were large enough to be visible from a distance. Many cultivators saw the message as well and started to whisper to each other.</p>
 <p>This was blatantly provoking Li Qiye. Without a doubt, this was creating an irreconcilable feud with him.</p>
 <p>Jianshi grimaced and said: “Someone is trying to goad you into a trap, Young Noble.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye revealed a smile and replied: “I actually want to see what they can do with this trap.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not Sima Yujian.” Ruyan stated her opinion.</p>
 <p>Jianshi gently shook her head: “I think so too. Despite being an assassin, she still has the pride of a great genius. She wouldn’t bother using this type of scheme.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked over at the direction of the arrow and cheerfully commanded: “Go that way.”</p>
 <p>“But what about the trap waiting for you?” Jianshi was rather worried.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye answered: “I’ll just go alone. I like breaking others’ schemes and seeing the desperation on their faces.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled and said: “If you want to go, then we will naturally follow you. Not too many people in the contemporary can scare us.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1309: The Trap</b></p>
 <p>The great ship traveled north along the direction of the arrow at a steady pace while remaining cautious.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were surprised to see the boat’s trajectory. Any reasonable person would know that the buoy from earlier was an attempt to goad Li Qiye towards the trap.</p>
 <p>They weren’t willing to be fooled and would rather avoid it completely instead of being led by the nose. Everyone knew that Li Qiye was aware of this trap, but to their astonishment, he still chose to go towards it.</p>
 <p>“Knowing that there is a tiger on the mountain yet still choosing to climb, how bold and decisive. What a confident person!” Even sea demons unavoidably felt a little admiration for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Prudence allows for a ship to sail ten thousand years.” An old cultivator murmured: “The path towards the dao is endless with countless dangers. If not careful, even the most amazing genius might find their boat capsize one day.”</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s take a look. I actually want to know who is trying to mess with Li Qiye.” Some cultivators couldn’t contain their curiosity and decided to follow.</p>
 <p>Someone had already placed a high bounty for Li Qiye’s head, and now there was this blatant provocation and trap. The person behind this must have an irreconcilable feud with Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The boat didn’t go too far before seeing another message on the sea with an arrow: “Li Qiye will die if he goes this way!”</p>
 <p>The boat, once again, followed the direction without any hesitation. After some distance, they kept seeing the same sign again and again with a new direction.</p>
 <p>“Just what kind of trap is waiting for him?” The quantity of the signs built up the anticipation of the cultivators following behind the boat.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the boat stopped because of a large sign with “Li Qiye will die here!” written on it. There wasn’t an arrow above the words this time.</p>
 <p>The spectators knew that the trap was before them, so they stopped to watch from afar.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye told the two girls: “Stop here, I’ll go take a look.”</p>
 <p>“Be careful.” Jianshi reminded him after seeing that he wanted to go alone.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I actually want to be killed.” Li Qiye looked at her and smiled: “It will be a good thing.”</p>
 <p>The two sisters were speechless. This was their first time hearing someone who wished to be killed.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slowly walked on the waves towards the sign in front of him. He seemed to be taking a stroll through his own garden instead of walking towards a trap.</p>
 <p>The sea demons in the distance were surprised by his carefree demeanor. One of them said: “This Li might be arrogant, but he can really back it up. Courageous and domineering, a very unique individual even among the young geniuses in Heaven Spirit.”</p>
 <p>“It’s about to begin, I wonder how strong his enemies are.” Some spectators were holding their breaths in anticipation. They didn’t want to miss a single detail. Some wanted to see just how strong this trap was and if it could deal with Li Qiye or not.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at the buoy and casually threw it away before smiling: “Come, do your worst and impress me.”</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” At the initial location of the buoy where Li Qiye was standing, great pillars soared into the sky from the bottom of the sea.</p>
 <p>They surrounded this region and runes began to appear on their surfaces.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” These runes instantly connected with each other like iron chains and sealed the entire area.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” They emitted a powerful aura and a blinding light. Even space seemed to be frozen.</p>
 <p>A spectator blurted after seeing this brilliance: “The aura of a sea god! This is a sea god’s method!”</p>
 <p>Now that the nearby space had been frozen by the pillars, they began to emit an energy to suppress Li Qiye and cut off all paths of retreat.</p>
 <p>“These are items personally refined by a sea god.” Someone commented after seeing some clues on the pillars.</p>
 <p>A cultivator asked: “Which sea god?”</p>
 <p>The paragon slightly opened his mouth, but he refrained from answering. He didn’t want to expose the background of the sea god. After all, he and Li Qiye didn’t know each other. There was no need for him to run his big mouth and provoke a sea god’s lineage.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” When Li Qiye gathered his blood energy, a seal of the sea god surfaced on the pillars in order to suppress his energy; it was immediately successful.</p>
 <p>Another expert wondered: “I wonder if Li Qiye can withstand this level of suppression in that sealed space.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind at all and stopped gathering his blood energy. He smilingly said: “Fine, I can still destroy you all without using my blood energy and merit laws. It’s time to show me your worth, don’t waste my time.”</p>
 <p>When all of his power was converged, he looked just like a mortal. The crowd was dumbfounded by his actions.</p>
 <p>Even in the face of a sea god’s suppression, he still chose to not use laws and his blood energy. Just how confident and domineering was this?</p>
 <p>Small buds stretched out of the sea. It looked like new branches were growing from them. Just like that, more and more of these young buds surrounded this sealed area for as far as the eye could see.</p>
 <p>“What is this?” The crazy growth of these buds creating a meadow-like location on the sea left many astonished.</p>
 <p>They didn’t know what these buds were. Shortly after, the buds grew into large vines like swimming serpents. They wove together and created a huge net that wrapped around Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>While this was happening, he stood there without moving while watching this scene with a smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s the Blazing-serum Treant!” The nest-like creation formed from these vines was finally recognized by a cultivator.</p>
 <p>Treants emerged from the sea as well as inside the sealed sky. Their heads were skulls while their bodies were made from vines and roots. Their bodies were very muscular, like horned dragons taking root in the sea. They grew with frightening speed and immediately crowded the entire area. Suddenly, huge vines covered everyone’s vision.</p>
 <p>Next, the net made out of giant vines began to rapidly shrink. It seemed to be using a mighty force to strangle Li Qiye inside.</p>
 <p>A different type of sea demon was standing on these gigantic vines as well. Their bodies were transparent like seawater, rendering their organs visible. When their bodies swayed with the vines, liquids continuously gurgled out into the vines themselves.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the vines crazily absorbed this liquid. It looked to be greatly nutritious since the vines could grow even faster to occupy the area.</p>
 <p>All of this happened very quickly. Starting from the buds until they grew into the entrapping vines, it only took the time it takes to perform a merit law.</p>
 <p>Escaping this sealed space was truly a challenge. Moreover, Li Qiye couldn’t move at all since he was wrapped by the vine net.</p>
 <p>“Ice-spirit Sea Demons, no way!” A sacred lord from the Dragon Demon Sea was startled.</p>
 <p>An unfamiliar cultivator asked: “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“Ice-spirit Sea Demons and Blazing-serum Treants have been mortal enemies for generations. They have always been at odds!” This sacred lord blurted out: “But these two races are complementary to each other. The water of the Ice-spirits is extremely nutritious for these treants, allowing them to mature faster. This means that the explosiveness of the treants would be dozens or a hundred times greater in combat…</p>
 <p>“... at the same time, the roots and buds of these treants are also nutritious for the sea demons. All along, the Blazing-serum Treants wanted to capture the Ice-spirit Sea Demons to suck their water dry while the Ice-spirits wanted to absorb the Blazing-serums’ roots and refine them into their own treasure liquids. They have massacred each other for generations, so why would they work together like this…?”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1310: Blazing-serum Treants and Ice-spirit Sea Demons</b></p>
 <p>“Boom!” The tightly woven net of vines suddenly caught on fire at the center. In fact, calling it a fire was far from sufficient to describe what was going on.</p>
 <p>This explosion left the net stranded in a sea of fire, making it seem like the sun itself. It immediately spread and exploded some more, emitting terrifying smoke. This ferocious flame swept through the entire area.</p>
 <p>The fact that the space was sealed exacerbated the scale of this flame of indescribable power. Its high temperature could burn everything to ashes.</p>
 <p>In this split second, the wooden net was no longer there, only a gigantic sun with its flames surging for thousands of meters could be seen.</p>
 <p>These terrifying flames assaulted the world and burned everything. Li Qiye, who was stuck in the center, was affected the most. The flame had probably burned him to ashes.</p>
 <p>The monstrous fire made it difficult for others to look straight at it. Many spectators were slack-jawed. Even a paragon was nothing in the face of this intense heat.</p>
 <p>“This is why the Blazing-serum Treants are so scary. If they are willing to risk it all by using their lifespan, they could incinerate their own bodies to kill their enemies.” A treant ancestor explained: “The presence of the Ice-spirit Sea Demons made these treants grow even stronger and amplified the power of the explosion.”</p>
 <p>“Is he still alive?” Someone squinted to look at the center of the ball of fire, but the blistering flames blocked their vision. Even a heavenly gaze couldn’t see through its blinding light.</p>
 <p>As the blasts continued, everyone became curious as to what Li Qiye’s situation was.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the flames moved wildly. This sky-searing flame caved in as if something within the artificial sun was devouring its power.</p>
 <p>More scorching sizzles resounded. The sealed space continued to quake as the blazing sun became smaller and smaller; it was as if it was losing its source of power.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the sun became small enough for one to see what was happening. Everyone could now see Li Qiye frantically devouring this sunflame.</p>
 <p>He had opened his fate palace. The cauldron of life emerged with the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter. The cauldron itself already had an eternal flame of life while this primal chapter had an affinity for high temperatures. Thus, their combination was fundamentally flawless and allowed for the perfect absorption of all flames.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the blazing flames of these treants were predicated on them burning their bodies. This type of flame was quite nutritious for Li Qiye, so his own fire of life grew much stronger after devouring it.</p>
 <p>How could he let go when such a good opportunity was brought to his doorstep? He directly used his cauldron of life to turn everything into his own.</p>
 <p>“How can this be? Something like this is actually possible?” Many people couldn’t believe their own eyes.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that the flame of this race was a wondrous substance since they burned their own life force in order to create it. However, not just anyone could withstand such an overbearing fire. Devouring this blazing flame could easily destroy their own cauldron of life.</p>
 <p>The Blazing-serum Treants became distraught after seeing all the fire being devoured by Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The experts of their race shouted: “Combine!” All of their branches grew at an astonishing pace as they took root within the deepest part of the earth.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Ice-spirit Sea Demons combined with the treants. Their own bodies merged with the branches, then they poured their spirit water inside.</p>
 <p>“This is so incredible, seamless cooperation from mortal enemies. Someone must have paid a sky-high price to make them work together like this to kill Li Qiye.” A sect master was astounded to see this teamwork.</p>
 <p>At this time, the treants seemed to be blooming with flowers. However, petals didn’t come out from the hollow holes filled with darkness.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” Lava rushed out from these holes. Some sprayed to the sky before aiming straight for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, lava gushed from all directions, aiming to drown and annihilate Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“The treants are using their killing move! Do not get hit by this hot serum or you’ll explode right away!” A treant expert lost his voice while screaming.</p>
 <p>The blazing serum from this race was quite terrifying. Not only did it have a high temperature, once it touched its prey, it would seem to come to life and invade the body before exploding.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the power of this explosion was enormous; it was dozens of times stronger than the flames from earlier. Even the strongest body wouldn’t be able to withstand the internal explosions.</p>
 <p>These serums that resembled lava came tumbling down from the sky, causing relentless explosions. The sealed space trembled, but everyone saw an unbelievable scene.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s cauldron of life immediately opened wide and crazily swallowed all the incoming serum. It violently quaked as explosions resounded inside. Without a doubt, this serum was detonating within.</p>
 <p>However, the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter and its laws fortified the cauldron of life by sealing it. The barrage of explosions couldn’t harm the cauldron at all. How could these blazing liquids blow away an item at the primal chapter’s level?</p>
 <p>Jaws dropped at this spectacle.</p>
 <p>“Is his cauldron of life made out of immortal metal? It is perfectly fine after this many explosions, even the strongest Godking cauldron wouldn’t be able to handle so many powerful outbreaks.” A sea demon of the paragon level was shocked.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” More blazing serum shot out in an endless manner. It crazily attacked Li Qiye’s cauldron of life as if this treant race wouldn’t give up until he was blown to pieces.</p>
 <p>A few sea demons were lost in admiration. One of them said: “It is fortunate that these two races are mortal enemies. If they work together, they might become one of the most terrifying lineages in the Dragon Demon Sea. This endless barrage of serum could instantly destroy a great power.”</p>
 <p>“No, that’s not right.” A Virtuous Paragon from the previous generation was quite experienced. After watching for a while, he shook his head and said: “Something is wrong, they are not in control of their serum anymore.”</p>
 <p>This paragon was right. At this time, the experts from the two races were completely frightened because their serum kept on gushing out. They had lost control of the situation as they kept on feeding Li Qiye’s cauldron of life as if it wanted to squeeze them dry.</p>
 <p>Even though their serum was quite powerful and horrifying, it also came at a heavy price. It was equivalent to a cultivator’s blood energy or even longevity blood. This lavish barrage of their serum meant that their longevity blood was being drained.</p>
 <p>An expert from the treant race shouted towards the Ice-spirit Sea Demons: “Separate!”</p>
 <p>Due to the previous fusion, their serum became stronger and, of course, this meant that Li Qiye was absorbing an even greater amount.</p>
 <p>“We can’t!” These sea demons were alarmed as well. Their spirit water was supporting the treants and their serum. However, Li Qiye was not only devouring the longevity blood of the treants, he was also sucking them dry since they were one with the treants.</p>
 <p>They desperately tried to separate their bodies, but Li Qiye’s cauldron of life had a formidable swallowing nature. It locked the two races together in a way that they simply couldn’t separate.</p>
 <p>Waves splashed everywhere. Despite the struggles of the two races on the sea, they failed to escape from Li Qiye’s grasp.</p>
 <p>“Oh mother! This is not the Blazing-serum Treants attacking Li Qiye, he is simply devouring their longevity blood!” Finally, people understood the situation and couldn’t help but quiver in horror.</p>
 <p>“No!” Ultimately, the experts from the two races screamed pitifully. Li Qiye had completely devoid them of their energy source. After a couple moments, countless corpses floated on the sea.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1311: Sea Aberration</b></p>
 <p>Fear spread throughout the crowd as they watched the corpses floating on the ocean. Several hundred Ice-spirit Sea Demons and Blazing-serum Treants were drained dry. All of their blood energy had been devoured by Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>A cultivator murmured while quivering: “This is too terrifying, what an evil art.”</p>
 <p>Another sect master commented: “These two races are done for. All of their elites, even high elders, have died here. They won’t be able to rise again. This is the result of greed, participating for an unobtainable bounty only to pay with their lives.”</p>
 <p>Many people quietly reflected on the situation. The two races were mortal enemies, always in a state of discord. But now, they actually worked together for once only to be slaughtered completely. What a tragic tale.</p>
 <p>“That was really filling.” Li Qiye recalled his cauldron of life and faintly smiled. His eyes then turned towards the sky as he flatly said: “What else you got? Bring it.”</p>
 <p>A thunderous voice came from the sky as if something was blown open: “Show the decree!”</p>
 <p>In an instant, a divine order with a majestic will descended. Its holy text ordered the nine heavens and myriad realms.</p>
 <p>Someone shouted in amazement: “The decree of a sea god!”</p>
 <p>This type of decree was written down by a living sea god. The moment it came out, the user would have control over its divinity. Some decrees had specific purposes while others were more general.</p>
 <p>The former mostly consisted of agreements between a sea god and a certain race or person. After the sea god passed away, the descendants of the other party could also use this decree to command others.</p>
 <p>A general purpose decree was a form of willpower used to suppress enemies. It was quite powerful since it represented the sea god. Ordinary cultivators couldn’t oppose it at all.</p>
 <p>This particular decree didn’t suppress Li Qiye. Its holy text and runes fell into the sea and disappeared shortly after.</p>
 <p>The water was still calm, so no one knew of its effects just yet.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” While the spectators were thinking about what the decree would do, a tsunami flooded the sky and flipped over the earth.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The entire sea quaked with continuous rumbles. Even the sealed space with Li Qiye inside was quaking nonstop, making it seem as if the seal could break at any moment.</p>
 <p>“Retreat!” Liu Ruyan was startled and immediately gave the order.</p>
 <p>After the boat from the Evil Devourer School retreated, the spectators followed suit. Even though they didn’t know what the item was, if the Evil Devourer School chose to retreat, it must be something major.</p>
 <p>Gigantic tentacles emerged from the bottom of the ocean. Each of them was a thousand miles long.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” They crowded the sealed space and immediately shattered it. The pillars floating on the sea broke apart as well.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” They danced in the sky while wreaking havoc. Each was as long as a mountain range, creating stormy tsunamis that towered for countless miles.</p>
 <p>The evacuators were shaken to see this scene from a distance.</p>
 <p>“What is that monster?” Many people found these gigantic appendages difficult to believe.</p>
 <p>“How could this be?” The effect of this decree was beyond their imagination. They didn’t think that this monster could destroy the sealed space just by awakening.</p>
 <p>Of course, some were secretly celebrating after the initial shock because the stronger this sea monster was, the greater the chance of it killing Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” An even more terrorizing scene unraveled. The feelers on these gigantic tentacles began to suck up the water in this region. The seawater here was suddenly being drained away at a rapid pace. The sea surface rose higher and a monstrosity appeared before them.</p>
 <p>It was a gigantic kraken, capable of easily crushing great mountains. Its body itself was monstrous in size while its long tentacles had huge feelers capable of devouring everything like tiny black holes.</p>
 <p>The kraken opened its eyes that resembled two bright moons, brightening up the whole sea.</p>
 <p>“What, what is this sea monster?” People gasped in the face of this monster.</p>
 <p>Everyone could imagine these tentacles easily pinching paragons to death.</p>
 <p>“An Emperor Kraken, a sea monster that ravaged the Dragon Demon Sea for a short period of time.” An old paragon recognized this monster. His eyes flashed with shock as he elaborated: “Legend states that a God-Monarch once challenged this monster but was torn to pieces alive. Later on, this creature met a sea god and disappeared afterward. Who would have thought that it was sleeping here.”</p>
 <p>Sea monsters were unique to the great oceans in Heaven Spirit. There were many of them and they were particularly formidable.</p>
 <p>They were different from sea demons. Sea monsters didn’t cultivate and would maintain their original form. Moreover, they were solitary creatures without groups.</p>
 <p>Because they didn’t have any intelligence and maintained their original form, they could live for a long time and become extremely powerful while gaining unique characteristics. They would either grow to unbelievable sizes or were highly toxic. Some had magical gifts as well.</p>
 <p>A cultivator curiously asked: “Which sea god was it?”</p>
 <p>The old paragon didn’t want to answer. Of course he knew which sea god subdued this kraken, it was just that he didn’t want to invite trouble to himself.</p>
 <p>The will of the sea god descending from the sky had awakened this slumbering sea monster.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Its huge tentacles immediately attacked Li Qiye. One could easily imagine their world-destroying power. Space was torn asunder as the winds hissed through the sky.</p>
 <p>However, before these tentacles could touch Li Qiye, he instantly disappeared and reappeared on the other end to look at the kraken with a smile.</p>
 <p>The beast reacted quickly. Another tentacle aimed for Li Qiye’s new location with lightning speed. Alas, even if it was faster, it was no match for Li Qiye. He disappeared once more to another location.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” In just a moment, the kraken’s long tentacles slammed down on this world, creating huge tidal waves. A calamity had descended on this sea region; the end of time was approaching.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s figure kept flashing back and forth in the sky. Because his speed of teleportation was too fast, his shadows were left in the sky. Eventually, these remnant images were everywhere.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the tentacles crazily attacked with enough speed to seem like countless dancing serpents. The sky was full of these tentacles as well.</p>
 <p>The spectators were dazed from this dance between the two combatants. They were truly too fast; no one could see them clearly.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” At this moment, the kraken that was using the seawater to float higher fell down. Monstrous waves were generated from its impact.</p>
 <p>At this point, people saw a bizarre scene. The winding tentacles of the kraken were unexpectedly twisted together. It had become a giant meatball, struggling to loosen the knots. Alas, the more it tried, the tighter the tentacles became, as if they were trying to strangle it to death.</p>
 <p>“You dare to prance around in front of me with your low intelligence?” Li Qiye looked at the desperately struggling kraken.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye deliberately planned a route during his evasion so that the attacking tentacles would tie each other into an inescapable knot.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked dumbfounded to see this giant meatball. The kraken’s body couldn’t support its current posture and sank into the sea.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1312: Five Generals</b></p>
 <p>Li Qiye rushed down towards the sinking kraken and grabbed one of its tentacles.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” Li Qiye then soared to the sky and dragged the monster up with him.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” The wind cried. Li Qiye spun the kraken around continuously like a windmill. They turned into a terrifying hurricane that crazily spun on the sea's surface.</p>
 <p>“Now go!” Li Qiye eventually let go.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The gigantic body of the beast flew and disappeared into the sky like a shooting star.</p>
 <p>It had been thrown out of the Dragon Demon Sea towards the boundless horizon. Who knows whether this kraken would be able to survive in the future?</p>
 <p>“He dealt with it just like that?” Jaws dropped to the ground. However, some experts felt that this was the best way to deal with the kraken.</p>
 <p>Such a sea monster had a resilient shell. Killing it in a short period of time wasn’t an easy matter. Directly throwing it out of the sea was much simpler.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye then stepped towards the sky and stomped on a white cloud.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The cloud dissipated along with a secret technique, revealing a huge ship.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to sneak around if you are already here.” Li Qiye stood in the sky and sneered at the exposed ship.</p>
 <p>“Go!” Two shadows rushed out of the ship in order to escape. However, they didn’t make it far before a bang sounded; they had slammed into something and were bounced back.</p>
 <p>They immediately changed directions with haste. Alas, the result was still the same. They slammed into something again and was forced back.</p>
 <p>This process repeated several times, but nothing changed. This space was sealed, so they couldn’t escape.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye watched them run around like dogs that had lost their masters. After a while, he sneered: “You aren’t the only ones who know how to seal space.”</p>
 <p>Space Sealing was another technique from the Space Scripture, part of the Space Control chapters. It was prohibitively difficult for cultivators to destroy this containment once trapped inside.</p>
 <p>The two fleeing figures finally stopped. They understood that the only way to escape from this space was to kill Li Qiye. People finally got a good look at them at this time.</p>
 <p>They were two old men. One was short but had a huge shield on his back. The other was a burly fella with a spear and a sharp glare.</p>
 <p>Someone exclaimed after clearly seeing the two: “These are two of the five generals of the Lithodidae Overlord, the Turtle and Spear Generals.”</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi weren’t surprised at all for this was within their expectations.</p>
 <p>The crowd glanced at each other after this revelation. Lithodidae had five generals: Turtle, Spear, Net, Hook, and Dagger. Rumor has it that these five generals had a formidable killing technique. Many experts much stronger than them had actually fallen to their hands. They had many illustrious exploits under the overlord.</p>
 <p>Turtle and Spear appearing together at this place had answered the question of who the mastermind behind the whole thing was to many. What made others curious was how this feud came to be between Li Qiye and the overlord.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and indifferently said: “So it is the overlord’s people. Looks like he couldn’t swallow the anger from the other day.”</p>
 <p>In fact, it wasn’t strange for the overlord to want to kill Li Qiye. He was a ruthless man who loved challenges. Taking Li Qiye’s head was, without a doubt, a great challenge.</p>
 <p>Turtle and Spear put on dignified expressions, and Turtle lowered his tone: “This has nothing to do with our master. We did this of our own volition.”</p>
 <p>“Loyal enough.” Li Qiye smiled: “Unfortunately, you two won’t be able to live any longer to show your loyalty to your master.”</p>
 <p>“Kill him!” The two generals didn’t waste any more words, it was time to fight to the death. Spear roared and rushed forward alongside Turtle.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Turtle’s gigantic shield ferociously slammed into Li Qiye like a mountain. Explosions sounded even before the impact.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and unleashed a finger strike through the sky, aiming for the shield.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” It didn’t matter how powerful or heavy this shield was, it couldn't handle Li Qiye’s attack. Turtle staggered backward after this exchange.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” While Turtle lost the first move, Spear suddenly appeared right behind Li Qiye like a poisonous serpent with his spear mercilessly aiming for Li Qiye’s ribs.</p>
 <p>He chose the perfect time to attack in order to deliver a fatal blow. Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye at the approaching spear. He flicked his finger, issuing a clanging noise and diverting the spear tip.</p>
 <p>Next, he attacked again, aiming straight for Spear’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Spear was startled and quickly pulled his weapon back to defend.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Turtle, who was repelled by just one finger, was aghast after looking at his shield. He was an All-shield Turtle, a very rare sea demon. His shield was part of his carapace and was unbelievable hard; it was countless times tougher than an ordinary divine metal. But now, there were cracks on it because of Li Qiye’s finger. Just how terrifying was the power contained in that strike?</p>
 <p>However, since Li Qiye was attacking Spear, Turtle didn’t have time to think too much and instantly rejoined the fray.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” Even though Spear was using his weapon for protection, it still couldn’t stop the approaching finger. The spear cracked while Li Qiye’s finger continued straight for his forehead.</p>
 <p>While watching Spear accept death, Turtle arrived just in time.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” His shield blocked Li Qiye’s attack once more to save Spear. However, it was completely penetrated this time.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a net appeared out of nowhere above Li Qiye’s head. It was as thin as fine silk, so it was hard for people to see. It looked just like a layer of mist floating over his head. It moved at an incomparable speed to surround and trap Li Qiye completely.</p>
 <p>Many people’s hearts skipped a beat after seeing this new development.</p>
 <p>In this split second, the net finally engulfed Li Qiye in a firm manner as another old man appeared in the sky.</p>
 <p>A spectator recognized him right away and shouted: “The Net General!” This was another general under the Lithodidae Overlord.</p>
 <p>Net heaved a sigh of relief after seeing that his net had a firm grasp on Li Qiye. He laughed raucously and said: “Even if your techniques were better, you still won’t be able to escape my heavenly net—”</p>
 <p>But his smile froze before he could finish. The net was indeed solid, but the one under it wasn’t Li Qiye, it was the Turtle and Spear Generals.</p>
 <p>As for Li Qiye, he was standing where these two generals were earlier.</p>
 <p>The Net General couldn’t believe his eyes. His ambush had never failed before, yet he missed his mark this time. Li Qiye wasn’t trapped, his allies had inexplicably fallen under it instead.</p>
 <p>This was Displaced Space under the spatial control branch. It allowed Li Qiye to swap positions with his enemies, which was why the other two generals were trapped instead.</p>
 <p>The two shocked generals shouted in unison: “Let go of us!”</p>
 <p>During all of the commotion, a black rope slithered towards Li Qiye like a spirit serpent and wrapped around him. It was simply too fast, making it seem as if it had been waiting for Li Qiye this whole time. The moment he stood still, it immediately coiled around him.</p>
 <p>Moreover, it coiled around him crazily as if aiming to strangle him. Another old man appeared out of nowhere while holding the other end of the rope.</p>
 <p>Someone exclaimed: “The Hook General!”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” A light flashed while the rope held Li Qiye tightly. This glint aimed for his throat in a ruthless manner in order to push him towards his death.</p>
 <p>“Pluff!” The incomparably sharp dagger pierced his throat. Blood sputtered under this fatal stab.</p>
 <p>“Haha, even if you were stronger, you can’t escape death in the face of our joint offense…” A gloomy voice sounded as the fifth old man appeared.</p>
 <p>He was the Dagger General, a master at ambush and assassination.</p>
 <p>He didn’t have much time to think before Shield, Net, and Spear standing in front of him were aghast. They all shouted at the same time: “No!”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1313: Space Shifting</b></p>
 <p>Dagger’s smile froze after hearing the group shout. He quickly looked over and found that it was Hook whose neck he pierced, not Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Blood spurted from his neck as his eyes went wide. He tried to speak, but people could only hear “ugh, ugh, ugg” coming out of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Dagger was stricken with shock and cried: “No!” He didn’t expect to have killed his own brother in this manner.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Li Qiye was standing where Hook previously was. Even though he was still tied up, he was completely unharmed and stood there calmly.</p>
 <p>It was Displaced Space again. He swapped positions with Hook right when the dagger swung by. Hook died without even knowing why.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely smiled: “It seems like you really are getting old with worsening eyesight, treating your ally as an enemy.”</p>
 <p>The other four’s expressions turned unsightly. Their ambush didn’t harm Li Qiye at all and instead resulted in their own brother dying.</p>
 <p>A sea demon murmured after seeing this scene: “All five generals of the overlord are here.”</p>
 <p>In fact, the five were all on the ship earlier, but after being exposed, Shield and Spear purposely came out to bait Li Qiye while the other three hid and waited for the right opportunity.</p>
 <p>The five had always worked together regardless of whether they faced a single enemy or hundreds. Their teamwork and techniques were incredible, ranging from ambushes, assassination arts, and traps…</p>
 <p>Because of this, many people stronger than them had fallen to their hands.</p>
 <p>This time, even though their location was exposed, they were still confident and wanted to use their great teamwork to kill Li Qiye. However, they didn’t expect for the first victim to be their own brother, Hook.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled at them and asked while still tied up: “Are you done yet?”</p>
 <p>The four generals looked at each other. They gathered closer together as Dagger gritted his teeth and said: “Little animal, it’ll be you or us today!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only chuckled in response: “Wrong, it will be the four of you dying unwilling deaths!”</p>
 <p>The four adjusted their positions while Li Qiye leisurely watched them set up their new formation.</p>
 <p>After the four were done, this new formation surrounded Li Qiye perfectly. No matter the angle, their attack wouldn’t harm their own people. At the same time, they were able to cut off Li Qiye’s movements while keeping him within the range of their attacks.</p>
 <p>“You four indeed understand how to work together.” Li Qiye gave an indifferent smile and said: “Unfortunately, your cultivations are too weak. If you all had the power of a Godking on top of this teamwork, you could do whatever you want in Heaven Spirit. You can kill ordinary cultivators with your strength, but in my eyes, the four of you are not much different from ants.”</p>
 <p>“Slay!” The four of them responded with a shout. In the blink of an eye, they seemed to have a mental connection and attacked at the same time from completely different angles.</p>
 <p>Dagger aimed for Li Qiye’s neck; Net threw a poisonous net made out of sand at his back; Shield attacked with the power of a mountain in order to shatter Li Qiye’s head; Spear’s weapon was as overbearing as fire. He unleashed a barrage of thrusts at Li Qiye’s legs.</p>
 <p>In the face of these attacks from all directions, Li Qiye was still as calm as ever despite being tied up by the black rope.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Time stopped in this sealed space, making the scene seem like a picture. An unbelievable spectacle unfolded before everyone.</p>
 <p>Dagger slashed Shield’s throat while Shield shattered Spear’s skull. Meanwhile, Spear pierced Net’s chest and Net’s sharp mesh cut through Dagger’s body.</p>
 <p>Their eyes were opened wide in astonishment. They had calculated their positions very carefully, so there was no chance of hurting their own brothers like earlier. Even if Li Qiye switched his position with one of them, accidental injuries still shouldn’t have happened.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye stood still this time. He had not shifted, it was the rest of them. They ended up killing each other, resulting in this scene.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Their bodies fell down one by one. These were indignant deaths since not even in their dreams would they have imagined that they would fall at the hands of their own brothers.</p>
 <p>Just like Li Qiye said earlier, they would be the ones to die unwilling deaths.</p>
 <p>“What the hell is that technique?” Many people gasped after seeing this. Even an expert at the sect master level paled with fear.</p>
 <p>This sect master’s senior, a Virtuous Paragon, explained: “This is a spatial technique. Li Qiye cultivates some kind of space technique, allowing him to arbitrarily control the movements of space.”</p>
 <p>The paragon was right. It wasn’t Displaced Space this time but rather Space Shifting. In that split moment, he shifted space so that they would kill each other. Just like that, Turtle’s throat was moved in front of Dagger’s attack while Spear’s skull was shattered by Shield.</p>
 <p>“He can do it on a whim?” The sect master was alarmed: “Doesn’t that mean Li Qiye can teleport people wherever he wishes?”</p>
 <p>The paragon mused for a bit before answering with uncertainty: “That depends on their cultivation. At a certain level, Li Qiye shouldn’t be able to shift his enemy through space, or maybe the effect would be greatly reduced.”</p>
 <p>In fact, he was right. Just as Li Qiye had stated earlier, the cultivation of the generals was too weak. If they were Godkings, it wouldn’t be easy for Li Qiye to move them. And even if he could, it would be very limited.</p>
 <p>But with their strength, they couldn’t protect their own space. It was very easy for Li Qiye to shift their spatial locations.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, why must such good brothers kill each other?” Li Qiye laughed. The black rope around him finally loosened and slipped off.</p>
 <p>This rope was not a threat to him at all. He was only playing with the generals to let them think victory was at hand.</p>
 <p>He floated in the sky and swept through the area. There was no other ambush, the enemy had exhausted their means.</p>
 <p>“Trying to kill me with such pathetic means? How disappointing, I was expecting a much better trap.” Li Qiye leisurely smiled while shaking his head before returning to Ruyan’s ship.</p>
 <p>Many were temporarily speechless after hearing this. In fact, they could see that the ambush from the five generals was quite formidable. The Blazing-serum Treants and Ice-spirit Sea Demons initiated the attack and were immediately followed by a monster like the kraken. Even a God-Monarch would find it difficult to evade death.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye came out unscathed while all the generals died pitifully.</p>
 <p>“Fierce is too terrifying, he is definitely not weaker than the Seashield Prince or Seven Martial Goddess.” A person shuddered while watching the ship from the Evil Devourer School leave.</p>
 <p>“He has a pretty good chance of becoming the Immortal Emperor of our generation.” An older sea demon had to admit that Li Qiye was mighty.</p>
 <p>“Heh, so what? Even if he was stronger, he can’t become the emperor.” A charming spirit sneered: “With Meng Zhentian around, he is only an ant unless he can become an Emperor Candidate in the next two years. Otherwise, Meng Zhentian will crush him to death!”</p>
 <p>Even those who didn’t like the statement couldn’t refute due to the current consensus of Meng Zhentian’s success. Competing for the Heaven’s Will against him was courting death, even for the greatest of geniuses.</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, the Seashield Prince and Seven Martial Goddess are sea demons, they don’t need to fight for the Heaven’s Will.” Some sea demons were thankful for this.</p>
 <p>If they didn’t need the Heaven’s Will, it meant that they didn’t have to become Meng Zhentian’s enemies.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1314: Seven Martial Pavilion</b></p>
 <p>The ship began to depart with Li Qiye back inside. He sat down and closed his eyes to relax. What happened earlier was just a mere warm-up for him. No, it couldn’t even be considered a warm-up.</p>
 <p>After his training, Li Qiye had mastered space control from the scripture to a peerless level.</p>
 <p>While looking at Li Qiye, Zhuo Jianshi said: “The Lithodidae Overlord really went all out.”</p>
 <p>The two of them understood the feud between Li Qiye and the overlord. The truth was that it was only a little resentment and not an irreconcilable feud. The problem was that Li Qiye didn’t give him any respect.</p>
 <p>But now, this became an unforgivable feud. He paid a great price for Li Qiye’s life and wouldn’t give up until the deed was done.</p>
 <p>“That overlord always likes to think of himself as a ferocious man who enjoys the hunt and won’t give up until the prey is dead.” Ruyan chuckled: “The bounty must have been exorbitant or else someone like Sima Yujian wouldn’t have come.”</p>
 <p>“He’s just another ant. After I’m finished with my business, I’ll destroy their Regal Valley.” That’s was the only statement Li Qiye made about the overlord. He didn’t even have enough interest to go and kill him right now.</p>
 <p>Jianshi and Ruyan glanced at each other. The Regal Valley was a sea god’s lineage, yet Li Qiye made it sound as if it was only a minor sect. However, they didn’t feel that his words were outrageous. Since he said so, the Regal Valley was doomed to extinction.</p>
 <p>After all the commotion, the ladies thought that the trip to the Bonesea would be peaceful again. Alas, they didn’t make it too far before a disciple came in with a message: “An elder from the Seven Martial Pavilion wishes to meet Young Noble Li.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? The pavilion.” Jianshi’s eyes became serious.</p>
 <p>Ruyan smiled in response: “It looks like even a behemoth like the pavilion can’t sit still. Regardless of their purpose for coming today, it shows that you have entered their sight.”</p>
 <p>The pavilion was the most powerful behemoth in the Dragon Demon Sea. It sat at the apex of all sea demons, a place full of masters. It once produced three invincible sea gods.</p>
 <p>There was a phrase at the Dragon Demon Sea — if the Roaring Conch could order all sea demons in the world, then the Seven Martial Pavilion could reign supreme in the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>Someone in Heaven Spirit once speculated that the unfathomable pavilion was not weaker than any lineage with three Immortal Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Let him in.” Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve with a smile.</p>
 <p>A moment later, an old man was led inside by the disciple. He wore a gray robe and a veiled hat. His blood energy was hidden, true to his low-key appearance.</p>
 <p>He saw the trio and bowed: “I am the third elder of the Seven Martial Pavilion. Nice to meet you, Young Noble Li, Schoolmaster Zhuo, and Schoolmaster Liu.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you for visiting despite the long journey.” Ruyan, as the host, gracefully responded with a charming smile.</p>
 <p>Both the pavilion and the three schools were behemoths, so they have dealt with each other before. As schoolmasters, the girls naturally recognized this elder.</p>
 <p>The elder didn’t waste time after the greetings. He brought out a wooden box with both hands and handed it over to Li Qiye: “Young Noble Li, this is our first meeting. Here is a token of goodwill from our pavilion, please accept.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye casually placed it on the table before opening it. A blue light shot out; it was very pure without the slightest flaw, as if many stars were stored inside.</p>
 <p>The box was filled with gems. Every single one of them was blue, as if each one stored an ocean.</p>
 <p>“Heart of the Sea. It looks like your pavilion is being very cordial this time.” Ruyan chuckled after seeing the contents inside.</p>
 <p>A “Heart of the Sea” was an exceedingly rare gem in Heaven Spirit. They were precious and could be used like refined jades. Each one could be traded for a large amount of jades. A box full of these gems was a very extravagant showing.</p>
 <p>Anyone else would be quite impressed, but not Li Qiye. He didn’t give the gems a second glance before looking at the third elder with a smile: “It looks like your pavilion has something to ask of me. Allow me to speculate.”</p>
 <p>“If I’m not mistaken, you want to invite me to replenish your ancestor’s life.” Li Qiye smiled after stating this conclusion.</p>
 <p>“How did you know, Young Noble?” The third elder was taken aback after hearing this.</p>
 <p>If this wasn’t a matter discussed only by the highest echelons of the pavilion, he would have thought that some disciples had leaked it.</p>
 <p>“Just a guess.” Li Qiye leisurely explained: “Your pavilion wouldn’t be this enthusiastic unless you needed my help. Your sect has no lack of treasures and merit laws, so that’s out of the question. As for recruitment... this probability isn’t high either. You don’t lack talents. Moreover, I have massacred billions of sea demons, so recruiting me would be harmful to the pavilion’s reputation.”</p>
 <p>He concluded: “Ultimately, the only thing I have that is worthy of your pavilion’s attention is my supreme alchemy. I replenished the Peacock Tree’s life, so your pavilion is tempted as well.”</p>
 <p>“Incredible!” The elder praised: “Your mind is very meticulous, worthy of admiration.” He bowed his head.</p>
 <p>There was no need to hide anything after all that had been said, so he continued: “It is just as you have said, our pavilion wants to invite you to perform your peerless alchemy to prolong our ancestor’s life. As for the payment, you just need to say the word, everything is negotiable.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi didn’t interject. They knew Li Qiye was capable of this task, but he wouldn’t do so very easily.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently shook his head: “I’m not interested. I don’t want to replenish anyone’s life right now. Even if someone is willing to pay handsomely, I still won’t do it.”</p>
 <p>The elder quickly added: “But Young Noble, you have done it for the Peacock Tree.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed in response: “I didn’t do so for the payment or because I owed the tree something, I did it because it has been protecting the human race. That alone is enough.”</p>
 <p>The elder busily pressed on: “Everything is on the table if you can renew our ancestor’s life.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied with a grin: “I don’t need anything. I do not lack treasures or wealth. Since this is the case, why should I perform something as demanding as life replenishment? It is a heaven-defying matter. Even though I don’t really care about the villainous heavens’ opinion, your payment isn’t worth my time.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you should reconsider.” The elder still didn’t give up. He handed Li Qiye a list and said: “As long as you are willing to try, it doesn’t matter if you are successful or not, we will pay you well. If successful, we can let you pick a sea god’s weapon and merit law.”</p>
 <p>Both the girls were moved after hearing this. These items were very precious, even for a sea god’s lineage.</p>
 <p>The pavilion had three sea gods so they possessed more than just a few weapons and merit laws. However, these items were still prized artifacts for their lineage.</p>
 <p>None of these great powers would ever use items of this level for trade unless there was no other choice. Who put the prodigal son in charge?</p>
 <p>“Now that’s more interesting.” Li Qiye smiled after the elder revealed his cards: “Among your ancestors, few are worthy of your lineage offering this much in exchange for life replenishment.”</p>
 <p>Ancestors were indeed valuable, but not to the level of trading ancestral weapons and merit laws for their lives.</p>
 <p>The elder hastily said: “Ah, ah, as long as Young Noble Li is willing, everything is negotiable.” [1. This line seemed a bit awkward for me the first time reading it. It looks like he is trying to stop the course of the conversation, so he repeated the same line again. That would make sense.]</p>
 <p>“Actually, there is only one person who is worthy of this high price.” Li Qiye smiled and continued: “The person whose life you are trying to prolong must be old Hallowed, correct?”</p>
 <p>“How, how do you know that?!” The third elder’s expression drastically changed as he tumbled backward. [2. The “you” here is impolite/informal now because of shock.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smirked in response: “Just calculated it with my fingers, that’s all. Outside of the old man that you all call the Hallowed Ancestor, no one else is worth a sea god’s weapon and merit law. To do so for anyone else would be a waste, a form of disrespect towards the forefathers. Yes, the only exception is the Hallowed Ancestor!” [3. Just a note about his name. It is Seven Hallowed Ancestor but I’m omitting “Seven” for readability.]</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1315: Hallowed Ancestor</b></p>
 <p>“Your Hallowed Ancestor is still alive?!” Ruyan and Jianshi were astonished as well.</p>
 <p>“Uh…” The elder awkwardly laughed. He knew he couldn’t hide it anymore, so he said: “His Venerable is still alive, but he isn’t interacting with the rest of the world.”</p>
 <p>There was no doubt that their Hallowed Ancestor had been sealed this whole time in order to allow him to live until now.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye faintly smiled and said: “He won’t live for much longer despite being sealed. Two sea gods have helped him in this process, but in the end, one cannot escape death.”</p>
 <p>The elder sighed at this comment. Unpleasant as it may be, it was the truth.</p>
 <p>Jianshi was amazed: “I have heard my elders talk about the Hallowed Ancestor before. He was the dao protector of two generations of sea gods!”</p>
 <p>The Hallowed Ancestor was the most powerful and oldest existence in the Seven Martial Pavilion. Even in the entire Heaven Spirit World, he was still one of the most supreme characters.</p>
 <p>When it came to the pavilion, many knew about the seven great styles, the strongest techniques of the pavilion. They believed no one knew all seven, but this was far from the truth.</p>
 <p>Their three sea gods all understood the seven styles. The reason why their main successor, the Seven Sea Goddess, was so famous was because she also knew the seven styles. Rumor has it that she was the only one who could claim this honor in the pavilion at this moment.</p>
 <p>The truth was that there was another person outside of the goddess, and he was much more powerful and terrorizing compared to her. It was the Hallowed Ancestor!</p>
 <p>“I heard your ancestor once challenged an Immortal Emperor with his seven styles.” Ruyan became curious.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye found the topic amusing, so he answered before the elder could: “That he did. After understanding the seven styles, he believed he was invincible and challenged Immortal Emperor Yan Shi. At that time, the young emperor didn’t have the Heaven’s Will just yet, but it still ended in the ancestor’s defeat. Despite losing, he could still hold his head high. Being only several hundred years older than the emperor, he had yet to reach his peak…” [1. Yan Shi means Golden Age, a pretty grand title. She became an unfathomable Immortal Emperor and chose the title “Yan Shi” because under her reign, the Nine Worlds entered the golden age of peace.]</p>
 <p>In the minds of the Charming Spirits, her achievements were incredible. She was someone comparable to their first emperor, Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.</p>
 <p>“Alas, the defeat had a profound and negative effect on him. It made him miss the opportunity to become a sea god, otherwise he would have become one. Nevertheless, he can still be proud of his achievement of personally protecting two future sea gods. He himself reached the top and was considered an existence capable of assailing Immortal Emperors.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s detailed verses left the elder surprised. This was something that happened in the distant past so few knew the truth. Of course, he was feeling very proud hearing about the tales of his Hallowed Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Well, he was still a little off from being able to assail Immortal Emperors.” Li Qiye noticed the proud demeanor of the elder and teased him.</p>
 <p>The elder’s fiery pride was suddenly extinguished by this quip. It made him quite embarrassed.</p>
 <p>In spite of Li Qiye’s comment, Ruyan and Jianshi marveled all the same. The Hallowed Ancestor’s achievements were incomparable; few could be his match. Of course, from another perspective, this showed just how invincible Immortal Emperor Yan Shi used to be. Even the ancestor who had mastered the seven styles couldn’t stop the young emperor.</p>
 <p>This was precisely why after her generation, the charming spirits always tried to find excellent human bloodlines. They all wanted to groom another existence as capable as Immortal Emperor Yan Shi.</p>
 <p>The elder took a deep breath and earnestly bowed towards Li Qiye to say: “If Young Noble is aware of this, there’s no need to hide it any longer. Yes, it is our Hallowed Ancestor who needs the life renewal.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at him in response: “So, your ancestor wishes to come into being? If he stays in his coffin underground, it shouldn’t be a problem to live for another two generations. The sudden desire for life renewal can only mean he wants to come out.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi understood why the pavilion wanted to do this right away. She spoke: “Your Hallowed Ancestor must want to protect the Seven Sea Goddess so that your pavilion can have your fourth sea god.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled: “In the present, the most promising candidates to become the sea god are the Seashield Prince and Seven Sea Goddess. The goddess is versed in the seven styles, so this is a great advantage. However, I also heard that the prince’s Void Physique will reach grand completion within ten years, so she must be feeling the pressure.”</p>
 <p>The elder wryly smiled and didn’t comment. As schoolmasters, the girls were able to understand many things with a single glance.</p>
 <p>“Both the positions of Immortal Emperor and sea god are meant for the young to compete, so it should be up to them. Your Hallowed Ancestor wouldn’t do something like eliminating his disciple's competitors.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan added: “The Roaring Conch isn’t easy to mess with either. I heard they still have a living overseer. If the goddess wants the position, they might be the ones to ambush her instead. I’m still surprised about your ancestor being alive, though.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the elder and said: “The conch is strong, but not to the level where your pavilion should be this wary. The one you are worried about has to be Meng Zhentian.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi shuddered after hearing this. If Meng Zhentian was to become the Immortal Emperor early and pick between the goddess and the prince then help them become a sea god, it would result in an unstoppable combination.</p>
 <p>This would be a duo capable of sweeping through Heaven Spirit and the nine worlds. No other overlord would be able to stop them.</p>
 <p>The two girls finally understood why the pavilion was willing to trade sea god’s weapons and merit laws to renew their ancestor’s life. They must make sure that the Seven Sea Goddess becomes the winner in this competition.</p>
 <p>In order to do so, their strongest ancestor must come out and personally protect the goddess!</p>
 <p>The elder took a deep breath and solemnly said: “If Young Noble Li is willing to help us, you can pick two items from our pavilion after the matter is done.”</p>
 <p>“It looks like you are adding more to the table.” Li Qiye laughed in response.</p>
 <p>The elder had no choice. These three figured out the essence of this issue too quickly. Without a doubt, they required Li Qiye’s assistance this time. It was better for them to decisively name the price in front of him.</p>
 <p>The other ancestors of the pavilion had told him that unless the bottom line is crossed, they were willing to agree to all of Li Qiye’s conditions.</p>
 <p>The elder stared at him earnestly: “Young Noble Li, what do you think now? Our pavilion sincerely wants to work with you. If you still think that these conditions are not suitable, you can state your own demands.”</p>
 <p>The elder put on a pitiful posture, letting Li Qiye do whatever he wanted. This was to say that Li Qiye could name whatever price he wanted. It was the pavilion displaying their sincerity in this deal for Li Qiye to see.</p>
 <p>“Same as before, I’m not interested.” Li Qiye was unmoved and refused with a grin.</p>
 <p>This attitude from Li Qiye was quite a headache for the elder. Anyone else would have already agreed to such favorable conditions, but Li Qiye was completely indifferent.</p>
 <p>The elder composed himself once more and continued: “Young Noble Li, you can pick any treasure from our pavilion as long as the life renewal is successful. Moreover, the Hallowed Ancestor will be your dao protector and shield as you become the Immortal Emperor!”</p>
 <p>The two girls were moved this time. The immortal throne was an incomparable temptation that no one could resist.</p>
 <p>Claiming that he would protect a human for the throne was a bold and seemingly blustering statement. However, it was different for the Hallowed Ancestor. He had protected two sea gods before, so his strength was beyond doubt. Furthermore, he was experienced in this endeavor. With his protection, as long as the genius was strong enough, the possibility of them becoming Immortal Emperor was quite high.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye only chuckled at this new condition.</p>
 <p>Jianshi, on the other hand, made a suggestion: “Elder, you might as well have your Seven Sea Goddess follow Young Noble. It would be a formidable alliance.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan chimed in with a smile: “That’s not a bad idea, marrying the goddess to Young Noble. The descendant of an Immortal Emperor and a sea goddess will have matchless talents. Plus, you will become family, so it would be a matter of course for Young Noble to renew your ancestor’s life.”</p>
 <p>“Err—” The elder didn’t respond right away. He took his time musing this idea. It really wasn’t a bad proposal at all.</p>
 <p>A match between an Immortal Emperor and a sea goddess was perfect. More importantly, Li Qiye had an imperial bloodline. If he were to become an Immortal Emperor, this bloodline would become even more precious. Their offspring would bring a golden age to the pavilion, and the bloodline of their descendants would undergo an unprecedented evolution.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1316: The Transaction</b></p>
 <p>“Hmm…” The elder grew indecisive under the egging of the two girls.</p>
 <p>He glanced at Li Qiye several times in the meantime while pondering. Eventually, he spoke: “Schoolmasters, I don’t have the authority to make a decision regarding your proposal, but I can talk to the ancestors about it once I return.”</p>
 <p>In fact, this suggestion had left his heart thumping fast. Judging by Li Qiye’s performance, he really did have the aptitude to become an Immortal Emperor. However, Meng Zhentian’s current prestige was too strong.</p>
 <p>However, if their Hallowed Ancestor were to become Li Qiye’s dao protector and help him survive the difficult parts, he really would have a chance to compete against Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Meng Zhentian’s strength was undeniable, but it was not as if the younger generation couldn’t surpass him. What they lacked was time. If a true overlord was willing to stop Meng Zhentian to buy time for the youths, then the Heaven’s Will might have a different master.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the marriage between an Immortal Emperor and a sea goddess was too promising to be left out. The truth was that the pavilion had thought about working together with Meng Zhentian as well. The problem was that he was too powerful. The person in charge of the alliance and the overarching situation would be Meng Zhentian, not the pavilion. At that time, there was a chance of them giving away a bride yet still losing an army on top of it. [1. Idiom, the most popular case being the one between Wu and Shu in the Three Kingdoms. Sun Quan married his little sister to Liu Bei, hoping to trap him in Wu when Liu Bei came to Wu to pick up his bride. However, Liu Bei managed to escape with his little sister. Zhou Yu gave chase and fell into Zhuge Liang’s trap afterward, so they lost troops on top of everything. If memory serves me right, Zhou Yu died soon after in the novel, coughing up blood from being angry at Zhuge Liang. That’s probably one of the earliest usages of coughing up blood from anger in Chinese literature.]</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed after noticing that the elder was tempted. He shook his head in response: “Don’t listen to their nonsense. If you all really want to renew your ancestor’s life, I can show you the way.”</p>
 <p>The elder hurriedly bowed: “Young Noble, do enlighten me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye spoke with a smirk: “I can renew his life and even guarantee success. My demand isn’t outrageous either, I only want one thing from your pavilion.”</p>
 <p>“May I ask what you want?” The elder was glad to see Li Qiye’s interest. A chance had finally appeared. He didn’t care what Li Qiye wanted, as long as he was willing to participate…</p>
 <p>A thick grin appeared as Li Qiye answered: “The seven styles.”</p>
 <p>“The seven styles?” The elder staggered back with a shocked expression after hearing this.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi wryly smiled as well. This wasn’t an outrageous demand? Could there be a higher demand in this world?</p>
 <p>The seven styles was the foundation of the pavilion. Rumor has it that the pavilion was established because of the seven styles.</p>
 <p>There were too many legends about this particular technique. Some said that it was the most powerful martial style in the nine worlds. It was extremely heaven-defying with no equal.</p>
 <p>To call it the best technique in the nine worlds since the start of time might be an exaggeration, but many people — including Immortal Emperors — thought that these styles were more powerful and scarier than Heaven’s Will Secret Laws if the users didn’t shoulder the Heaven’s Will.</p>
 <p>It was much more precious than secret laws and physique laws. There were other secret laws and physique laws, but the seven styles was unique.</p>
 <p>There were reports that the seven styles might actually originate from one of the nine heavenly scriptures, the Dao Scripture. Alas, no one in the world could verify this claim. Nevertheless, the prestige of the seven styles had been untouchable the whole time. Even an existence like Immortal Emperor Yan Shi had to admit that it was unparalleled after experiencing it herself.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you must be messing with me.” The elder finally regained his wits. He coughed and gently shook his head: “I’ll be candid, everything is up for discussion except the seven styles.”</p>
 <p>The elder firmly stated this. In fact, if a day came for the pavilion that they had no other choice, they would be willing to lose or trade anything outside of the seven styles.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smilingly replied: “I don’t want anything else from your pavilion besides the seven styles.”</p>
 <p>“Can’t you change your mind? Maybe a few sea god’s weapons or merit laws? As long as it is within reason, we can talk about it.” The third elder tried once more. If this life renewal were to be successful, there was a high chance that they could have another sea god.</p>
 <p>Thus, trading two or three weapons and a few merit laws for a sea god was a great deal.</p>
 <p>“Frankly, I’m not interested in them. The seven styles is what I want. Your pavilion should know better than anyone else, if you could do it yourself, you wouldn’t be asking an outsider for help...</p>
 <p>“... How much longer can your Hallowed Ancestor survive? He has been living since Immortal Emperor Yan Shi’s generation and has come into being twice since then for his junior sea gods. Even though these sea gods personally helped seal him again and spared no expense in prolonging his life, too much time has passed. He won’t be able to endure the relentless years for long.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye paused for a bit before continuing: “Think about it, your ancestor has used countless longevity pills, medicines, and immortal vegetation. It can be said that he has tried virtually every method of life renewal…”</p>
 <p>“... From an alchemy perspective, it is simply impossible to prolong your ancestor’s life any further, let alone help him come into being to protect someone else.” Li Qiye laughed at this point, knowing that he had the upper hand.</p>
 <p>“But Young Noble, you seem to be very confident.” The elder carefully thought before replying to Li Qiye’s spiel.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was right about the circumstances, true to what little he had heard before. Even though he didn’t know how many panaceas his ancestor had used, he was certain that the pavilion had given everything possible to the ancestor in the past.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and said: “Yes, I do have a method for a successful life renewal so that he can happily become the dao protector of the goddess. But ultimately, I only want the seven styles.”</p>
 <p>The elder had no response because this was an impossible demand.</p>
 <p>“You should understand that given your ancestor’s circumstances, replenishing his life wouldn’t be easier than doing so for the Peacock Tree. For a life renewal of this magnitude, do you honestly think a few weapons and merit laws can move me? I have Immortal Emperor True Treasures and Heaven’s Will Secret Laws, so none of your pavilion’s items interest me outside of the seven styles.”</p>
 <p>“Well, regardless of the situation, we can’t trade our seven styles.” The elder shook his head.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then I can only say that this is quite regrettable.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “The problem is not on my end but yours.”</p>
 <p>He continued on with a smile: “If I refuse to save your ancestor, you can say that I am cruel and emotionless. That’s a reasonable statement to make. However, the truth is that I have agreed, it is your side that won’t accept. Thus, you can’t blame me for what happens, it’s your problem now.”</p>
 <p>The elder found himself stuck at an impasse and didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p>“You can reconsider, I still have some time. Don’t keep me waiting though, I’ll be leaving Heaven Spirit eventually.” Li Qiye smiled.</p>
 <p>The helpless third elder had to bid farewell to Li Qiye: “I’ll go back and discuss your demand with the ancestors.”</p>
 <p>With that, he reluctantly left. There was nothing else to negotiate since the seven styles was absolutely not up for trade.</p>
 <p>After he left, Li Qiye looked at the two girls and said: “Pretty grand scheme the two of you had earlier.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi smiled awkwardly with her head hanging low like a young wife.</p>
 <p>Ruyan, on the other hand, was still very playful: “It is mutually beneficial. If the martial goddess can ascend and you become the Immortal Emperor, your marriage would be a match made in heaven.”</p>
 <p>She grew even bolder and charmingly smiled: “Young Noble, you have been allied with our three schools for generations. If you become an emperor with a sea goddess as your imperial queen, our schools can bask in your glory as well, right?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled after hearing this; he didn’t mind their attempt at all. Of course, they had their own opinions about trying to match Li Qiye with the Seven Sea Goddess.</p>
 <p>Jianshi eventually lifted her head and asked: “Young Noble, do you really want to replenish the Hallowed Ancestor’s life?”</p>
 <p>“Oh? It looks like the two of you think very highly of the Seven Sea Goddess. Do you really want to see her ascend?” Li Qiye batted his eyes and smiled.</p>
 <p>“I just want to help you marry a sea goddess.” Ruyan winked back with a charming smile.</p>
 <p>“We have met the Seashield Prince and Seven Sea Goddess before.” Unlike Ruyan who was rather sly, Jianshi was frank and sincere: “I would rather have the Seven Sea Goddess as the victor. We don’t have an optimistic view on the Seashield Prince, at least with respect to Heaven Spirit and our Void Imperfection Schools.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1317: Lithodidae Overlord’s Second Provocation</b></p>
 <p>Jianshi said in a serious manner: “We don’t think highly of the prince not because of his talents, but rather his ambition for expansion.”</p>
 <p>Her gentle eyes looked over at Li Qiye as she revealed her thoughts: “Sea gods and Immortal Emperors are different. Even if an emperor comes from Heaven Spirit, they won’t necessarily stay here, but a sea god will always return. Sea gods will rise and fall here…</p>
 <p>“... The ambition of an emperor is the entire nine worlds while a sea god’s is limited to Heaven Spirit. The other locations, to them, are only fleeting visits. If the prince were to become the next sea god, his impact would be much greater than the Seven Sea Goddess. Many charming spirits would prefer to see her win.”</p>
 <p>“To be honest, we have a good personal relationship with the Seven Sea Goddess.” Ruyan chuckled and winked at Li Qiye like a seductive temptress. Her charm sunk straight into the heart as she smiled: “For both personal and business reasons, we want to see a sea goddess in the future.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Li Qiye smiled in response: “She is so young yet well-versed in the seven styles — this means that her chance of success is quite high. However, that’s the business of herself and the pavilion, it has nothing to do with me. They just need to give me the seven styles and I’ll replenish the Hallowed Ancestor’s life.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi emotionally sighed: “The seven styles…”</p>
 <p>She knew that such a trade was simply impossible. The pavilion would never trade the seven styles to anyone.</p>
 <p>“I heard the seven styles actually came from the Dao Scripture.” Ruyan became quite curious and smiled: “Young Noble, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>“You seductress, don’t try to pry it from me.” Li Qiye smiled then glared at her: “I don’t have an opinion on this matter.”</p>
 <p>“But you really want the seven styles. I actually thought that you were trying to collect parts of the Dao Scripture.” Ruyan wasn’t afraid of Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Dao Scripture, eh?” Li Qiye replied with great amusement: “Many things aren’t just legends, but yes, the seven styles are indeed very tempting.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan softly asked: “Must you have the seven styles?”</p>
 <p>“Little girl, you are mistaken. If I was determined to get it, it would be in my hands right now. For me, it is only a little interesting, not to the point where I must have it.”</p>
 <p>The two girls didn’t comment further. They understood that the seven styles had always been a highly-coveted item for millions of years. People’s mouths would start to water whenever they thought about it.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>After Li Qiye killed the five generals, many thought that the Lithodidae Overlord would avoid him. After all, Li Qiye was basking in the spotlight on top of being a very ferocious genius that was always ready to massacre an entire clan or sect.</p>
 <p>However, the overlord unexpectedly did not avoid Li Qiye at all. On the other hand, he held a public feast while maintaining a bright demeanor.</p>
 <p>He invited many experts and young geniuses to this party. Moreover, it was held at the War Cliff, not far away from the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>“To remember and celebrate the glory and accolades of the ancestors after coming here.” The overlord gave this reason for the celebration.</p>
 <p>This public feast left everyone with different interpretations and opinions.</p>
 <p>Someone who understood him explained: “Li Qiye is a monster, but the same is true for the overlord. He views Li Qiye as prey and won’t give up until the hunt is over. This overlord likes a challenge and a certain amount of risk in his conquest. He basks in success after making a trophy out of his victims. In recent years, he has killed many characters stronger than Li Qiye, and now, Li Qiye’s head is his new target. Even if he has to throw away everything, he will not give up!”</p>
 <p>After hearing this news, a sect master slowly said: “The War Cliff is very close to the Bonesea. I think Li Qiye’s group has to go through it first. Is he really picking the War Cliff as the location for the feast just out of remembrance and to honor the ancestors?”</p>
 <p>“I think he is trying to lure Li Qiye in.” A sea demon was certain: “People always say that this overlord is a huge deviant. If he could cut off Li Qiye’s head in front of everyone, it might be the most pleasurable thing in his life. It would be one of his biggest achievements for sure.”</p>
 <p>“He’s quite brave, but does he have the strength to kill Li Qiye? Plus, Li Qiye might not even go to the War Cliff.” Some were full of curiosity.</p>
 <p>Of course, some felt distressed as well, such as the ones that were invited by the overlord to this celebration. A few of them didn’t want to get into this kind of trouble. In their eyes, both Li Qiye and the overlord were too ruthless, they wanted no part in this.</p>
 <p>However, if they didn’t accept the invitation, the overlord might hold a grudge against them. Once they were there, it would be good if the overlord could kill Li Qiye. However, if he couldn’t and Li Qiye massacred everyone there in anger, it would be quite a miserable fate for them.</p>
 <p>“Who knows who will win?” The blatant provocation made people suddenly smell the stench of blood.</p>
 <p>“The overlord is someone who never conducts himself in a righteous manner; he has no scruples about the methods he deploys. He is not an ordinary expert or genius. Those people require face and their conduct revolves around it, but not the overlord. I’m sure he has ways of killing Li Qiye even if he is weaker. He has never failed before, so he must have something up his sleeves before deciding to make such a grandiose move.” A Heavenly King of the sea demon race analyzed the situation.</p>
 <p>“What a ruthless man.” Some actually felt admiration for him.</p>
 <p>It was common knowledge that the overlord was unlikely to become the next sea god. His shortcomings were very obvious compared to the Seashield Prince and Seven Sea Goddess. Of course, he had no ambition to become the next sea god either. He enjoyed the sensation of the hunt and the thrill of killing even more. Because of this, he had a bad reputation for being a deviant in the Dragon Demon Sea.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye also received this news.</p>
 <p>Ruyan told Li Qiye right away after hearing about it: “That Lithodidae Overlord is holding a banquet at the War Cliff.”</p>
 <p>“A very brave man.” Li Qiye smiled: “Still daring to show his face in this situation, what exceptional courage.”</p>
 <p>“He might be declaring war on you, Young Noble.” Jianshi slightly frowned: “He must have prepared more traps at the War Cliff and is waiting for you to jump in.”</p>
 <p>“Not might, he is for sure.” Ruyan chuckled: “He knows that he has no chance of becoming a sea god, so he is using these gimmicks to raise his own prestige. Instead of calling him a pervert, it is more apt to say he has an inferiority complex. If he was a truly ferocious character, he would be challenging the Seashield Prince’s group and mercilessly force himself to become a sea god! Alas, he doesn’t even have the courage to face the challenge head-on, how can people think of him as being ruthless? Knowing that it is impossible yet still choosing to do it, that is true ruthlessness to oneself.”</p>
 <p>“Such eloquence.” Li Qiye laughed right away: “Reaching the throne and becoming a sea god indeed requires courage and ruthlessness. Doing the impossible — this has always been a driving force for cultivators along their endless road.”</p>
 <p>“I am elated to hear your praise.” She gave a charming smile that pulled at the heartstrings.</p>
 <p>“Are you going, Young Noble?” Jianshi was much more dignified and graceful compared to the demoness.</p>
 <p>“Of course, why wouldn’t I?” Li Qiye happily answered: “He is someone who is certain of victory, the type I like to crush the most. I will trample on his confidence and make him drown in despair before sending him to his miserable end, a descent from joy to nothingness.”</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, you are the real pervert here.” Ruyan shot out a seductive glance capable of stealing away souls.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and commanded: “Go, to the War Cliff.”</p>
 <p>The boat of the Evil Devourer School headed straight for the cliff. This didn’t go unnoticed; the crowd knew that this was the prelude to the play.</p>
 <p>“Two monsters. One who is completely undeterred by danger while the other must have a successful hunt.” A sea demon commented: “This will be a splendid show.”</p>
 <p>“The result is uncertain, so it will certainly be exciting. I won’t miss this for anything!” Some followed right after the boat, anxious to watch the fun.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1318: Swiftdao Celestial God</b></p>
 <p>The War Cliff was relatively close to the Bonesea. Fierce waves slammed against the cliff in a relentless manner.</p>
 <p>Cliffs emerged one after another from the sea. Each of them had different cracks and varying amounts of damage. Some had been severed in two while others were in shambles, and even more were pierced through completely while some were pried open…</p>
 <p>Today, the cold seawater didn’t give these cliffs any breaks, as if they were recalling the terrifying war of past.</p>
 <p>Rumor has it that this place used to be a complete mountain with lush vegetation. Even though it wasn’t considered a continent, it was the home for many cultivators.</p>
 <p>However, a war occurred and ravaged this land. The remnants of this fierce battle rendered this land uninhabitable.</p>
 <p>The main character of this war back then was the Regal Valley’s progenitor, the Lithodidae Sea God! After those war-torn days, he managed to establish his unshakable position.</p>
 <p>At the beginning of his generation, the Trident accepted the Bloodshark Sovereign. Later on, it abandoned him for some unknown reasons and accepted Lithodidae instead. Because of this, a new chapter was written for this existence.</p>
 <p>Of course, being accepted by the Trident didn’t mean that they became a sea god right away. The user must train and experience tribulations. Only when they were truly standing at the peak and able to use the laws of sea gods would they be considered a real deity.</p>
 <p>Before grasping the laws of the sea, one wasn’t considered a sea god even with the Trident. They were only candidates at best.</p>
 <p>In fact, these candidates had been forcibly replaced many times. This was how the second sea god of the Seven Martial Pavilion came to be.</p>
 <p>The tales told that in the beginning, the Trident didn’t accept this particular successor of the pavilion. However, the pavilion was too heaven-defying and nurtured a successor with mighty power. He used supreme means to suppress the Trident while killing the current candidate.</p>
 <p>This candidate was formidable as well, especially when he had control of the Trident. Alas, he still wasn’t a sea god at that point and couldn’t exert the Trident’s true power without the accompanying laws. In the end, the pavilion was able to subdue the Trident and kill the current candidate.</p>
 <p>At the same time, its successor created a supreme grand dao with his matchless momentum and pure bloodline. Ultimately, he was accepted by the Trident and proceeded to master the sea god laws to become an invincible sea god.</p>
 <p>This was the famous Deep Blue Sea God, the second of the Seven Martial Pavilion. [1. Same words for Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer.]</p>
 <p>Back to the tales of Lithodidae; he was accepted by the Trident at a young age to become a candidate. However, many sea demons defied him. After all, he had a humble origin. It could even be said that him being accepted by the Trident was a confusing and earth-shattering matter.</p>
 <p>Just think about it, how could such a candidate be accepted by the Heaven Spirit World? This was doubly true for lineages like the pavilion and the conch. They especially didn’t accept his position.</p>
 <p>At that time, these sea god lineages wanted to steal his position. Some even thought about suppressing the Trident then killing him.</p>
 <p>Finally, the animosity between the two sides erupted. The Roaring Conch formally commanded the sea demons in this world to fight against Lithodidae at the War Cliff.</p>
 <p>The sea god personally led his army to battle against the invincible legion from the Roaring Conch.</p>
 <p>This was a world-destroying battle; the sun and moon lost their brilliance. The end of this battle resulted in countless bodies floating in the blood-red Dragon Demon Sea. Even more corpses sank to the seabed.</p>
 <p>In the generations to come, some people explored the depths and found mountains of bones. From then on, people were deterred and didn’t dare to dive down again.</p>
 <p>From this, one could easily imagine the tragic battle. Of course, Lithodidae paid a great price in the end and won the war. He fortified his status and eventually controlled the laws of the sea to become a real sea god.</p>
 <p>Today, the Lithodidae Overlord held a feast here to celebrate his ancestor’s glory. This action made sense because this battle was full of accolades and made his ancestor a sea god. No matter how one looked at it, this was a reasonable choice.</p>
 <p>Even though this region had been ravaged by war with cold waves crashing into the cliffs, it was very lively right now.</p>
 <p>Vessels made from divine metals were everywhere. Some were gigantic while a few were as small as a leaf…</p>
 <p>These ships held the overlord’s people as well as his guests consisting of many experts and geniuses from the great powers. Normally, it wouldn’t be easy to participate in a celebration like this due to the long distance.</p>
 <p>However, sects from all over the seas were coming to the Bonesea, so the overlord seized this opportunity.</p>
 <p>The participants all knew that this feast was directed at Li Qiye. Some didn’t want to become involved in this storm, but they had to give the overlord some face due to his grand invitations.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for his neighbors. If they didn’t show him some consideration today, he might take care of them tomorrow! Thus, many felt nervous about the fallout that was bound to happen.</p>
 <p>However, one person’s arrival made them heave a sigh of relief. It was the famous Swiftdao God!</p>
 <p>He was the current lord of the Swiftdao Sacred Ground and also Sima Yujian’s junior brother. He came on a leaf boat without excessive pomp. This leaf boat actually flew quickly in the air and made it to the cliff instantly.</p>
 <p>Despite being called a celestial god, he appeared quite young and had a mighty heroic aura. He was adorned with a sapphire robe and had a sword lying on his knees, completely inconsistent with his aura.</p>
 <p>For someone like him, nothing would be able to deter his path of triumphant regardless of the occasion, location, and difficulty.</p>
 <p>Despite looking like a fifteen-year-old, this was not his real age. Of course, he wasn’t much older.</p>
 <p>His title of “celestial god” wasn’t his own choice but an honorific given to him by the rest of the world.</p>
 <p>There was a story to this particular title. Back then, Sima Yujian suppressed all of her fellow disciples with her Dao Sovereign cultivation while vying for the lord’s position.</p>
 <p>However, when the Swiftdao Celestial God appeared, he used the cultivation of a Celestial God to defeat Sima Yujian. His advantages in cultivation were too great, so from then on, people called him the Swiftdao Celestial God for his full title. He was only sixteen at that time.</p>
 <p>After reaching Virtuous Paragon, two different paths are available. One was the path of the heavens while the other the path of the grand era. The heaven’s path was one to compete for the Heaven’s Will to become the Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>There were eight levels on this path: Dao Child, Dao Master, Dao Sovereign, Celestial Mortal, Celestial General, Celestial God, Emperor Reserve, and Emperor Candidate.</p>
 <p>When a cultivator was on this path, they must create a grand dao that belonged to themselves. At the Celestial Mortal level, their grand dao could begin to feel the power of the Heaven’s Will.</p>
 <p>At the Emperor Reserve level, their grand dao would be accepted by the Heaven’s Will. This was in preparation to obtain it in the future.</p>
 <p>At the Emperor Candidate level, the great war for the Heaven’s Will would begin.</p>
 <p>It was easy to see how unfathomable he was to reach the Celestial God level at the age of sixteen. Of course, this was partly due to the merit laws from the Swiftdao Sacred Ground, but it shouldn’t diminish the involvement of his peerless talents.</p>
 <p>The Lithodidae Overlord personally came out to greet him with great enthusiasm. He said with a smile while cupping his fists: “The arrival of the celestial god is an honor for this lowly one as well as our Regal Valley.”</p>
 <p>The Swiftdao God, on his small boat, nodded his head without standing up and slowly said: “I am passing by on my way to the Bonesea. After receiving Brother Lithodidae’s invitation, I’ve decided to stay for a bit.”</p>
 <p>The overlord was much older than the celestial god, but he didn’t dare to posture in front of him. He busily received him with a beaming expression.</p>
 <p>“That’s the celestial god.” Many people were relieved. Regardless of what happens next, the overlord wouldn’t dare to act recklessly, and Li Qiye wouldn’t attack the celestial god either.</p>
 <p>In fact, the celestial god was very respected, especially by the younger generation. They had high hopes for him. In the view of many people, he actually had a good chance of competing for the Heaven’s Will against Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Although they didn’t know his current realm, they were aware that he was a celestial god at sixteen years of age. Many speculated that it was likely for him to be at the Emperor Reserve level.</p>
 <p>Coupled with the unparalleled merit laws of the Swiftdao Sacred Ground, he could catch up to Meng Zhentian as long as he had another three to five years.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1319: Attending The Banquet</b></p>
 <p>The majority of the guests came to greet him. Both the young geniuses and older experts respectfully addressed him as “celestial god”.</p>
 <p>He was the one granting them solace from this stressful event. No matter how much trouble the overlord was about to bring, he wouldn’t dare to go overboard.</p>
 <p>The overlord prepared a platform close to the sea surface above the War Cliff. However, after the celestial god’s arrival, not too many were sitting there.</p>
 <p>The celestial god remained on his small boat and maintained a certain distance from the overlord.</p>
 <p>Since he didn’t sit down, the others didn’t dare to take a seat either. They all stayed on their own boats. In fact, this was only an excuse. No one wanted to be close to the crazy overlord. Who knows what he was about to do?</p>
 <p>Of course, the overlord didn’t care. He drank his wine in a carefree manner; this feast was only a means to an end.</p>
 <p>He commanded his disciples to serve the guests with wine and food while sitting alone on his platform. After several courses were served, he found that the time was about right.</p>
 <p>He stood up and raised his cup while looking at the guests: “Today, it is our honor to be graced with everyone’s presence. As a junior thinking about the supreme prestige of my ancestors, I find that I will never be able to achieve what they achieved in an entire lifetime. I salute everyone for celebrating their deeds. Remember, no matter the generation, the sea gods will always be protecting our sea demon race…”</p>
 <p>The others stood up and raised their cups in response. Even though many were forced to attend, they had to give him some face in this situation.</p>
 <p>Only the celestial god didn’t stand up. He simply sat there and saluted back.</p>
 <p>“Finish your drinks, everyone!” The overlord enthusiastically shouted after finishing his fervent speech.</p>
 <p>The rest quickly downed their cups. They all wanted to be done with this feast as soon as possible. Of course, they were wondering why Li Qiye hadn’t come yet.</p>
 <p>“How can I not come for a drink as well when such a nice feast is taking place?” A leisurely voice sounded right when everyone put down their cups.</p>
 <p>“Fierce is here.” Someone shouted but then busily covered their mouth.</p>
 <p>The crowd turned around and saw the boat from the Evil Devourer School stopping at the border of the War Cliff.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye walked off the boat, accompanied by Liu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>The overlord was not surprised to see Li Qiye. He was actually all-smiles as he quickly walked up to greet them.</p>
 <p>“The Evil Devourer Schoolmaster is here too?” Some people felt even more relieved after seeing Liu Ruyan. With her and the Swiftdao God present, nothing too crazy should happen.</p>
 <p>An old sea demon quietly voiced his disagreement: “The sky will turn over if the overlord doesn’t go crazy. After becoming the Regal Valley Master, he even killed his master, a high elder of the sect, just because he desired his master’s wife. His father, the old valley master, tried to stop him, but he killed his father as well. Heh, rumors outside say that they died from illness, but this is something many in the valley know about.”</p>
 <p>“He’s a madman. Just watch, he’ll do something insane for sure.” A disciple from the Regal Valley whispered with the lowest volume. Only his peers could hear him.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s arrival prompted many guests to quietly move their ships back in preparation for the inevitable madness from the overlord.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Brother Li and Schoolmaster Liu. This is indeed an honor.” The overlord personally greeted Li Qiye with great enthusiasm.</p>
 <p>Many people found his cheerful expression surprising. Everyone knew that his five generals were killed by Li Qiye. The overlord naturally knew this as well, but he acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“What a strange man, ordinary people can’t do this.” Another quietly spoke while looking at the overlord acting polite and respectful towards Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>After his five generals ambushed Li Qiye, everyone could guess that it was him who paid the sky-high bounty for Li Qiye’s life. But now, he was acting as if they were old friends. It was a very disconcerting spectacle.</p>
 <p>He led Li Qiye and Liu Ruyan to the platform. Li Qiye only smiled to this hospitality while sitting down.</p>
 <p>Many people were in awe to see Li Qiye up there. As long as one wasn’t too stupid, they would understand that this feast was not as simple as it seems. No one would want to sit up there, but Li Qiye didn’t give a damn and showed off his arrogance despite knowing that it was a trap. Just how bold and courageous was this?</p>
 <p>Even the Swiftdao God stared at Li Qiye in a profound manner. He also wanted to see what Li Qiye would do to overturn the tide.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat down and leisurely asked: “Lithodidae Overlord, do you not know or are you pretending?”</p>
 <p>The overlord was caught off guard after hearing this: “Brother Li, what are you talking about?”</p>
 <p>The guests watched this conversation with bated breaths.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smilingly explained: “Have you not heard? A few days ago, I killed five people known to be your generals. Are you not aware of this?”</p>
 <p>“Is that true?” The overlord was in disbelief: “My generals were sent to patrol the frontier of the Regal Valley, they couldn’t have possibly appeared here!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye burst out in laughter at this point: “Is that so? Then me killing them is really a big coincidence. Well, I could have gotten the wrong people, but what does everyone else think?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know anything about this since I’ve been busy worshipping my ancestors for the last few days. I haven’t inquired about the matters of the sect.” Having said that, he shouted: “Attendant! What actually happened?!”</p>
 <p>An old man walked out after hearing the loud question. He looked at the overlord and then Li Qiye, not knowing how to answer.</p>
 <p>The overlord lowered his tone: “I’ve been offering incense and burning ceremonial papers in private recently. When I’m not in control, you have full authority. Tell me, what actually happened? Were the five generals killed?”</p>
 <p>The guests glanced at each other after hearing this play by the overlord and thought that he was really too much.</p>
 <p>“My lord, well, about this…” The attendant stammered while looking at the overlord; he couldn’t form a coherent sentence.</p>
 <p>Fury sparked in the overlord’s eyes as he coldly uttered: “What happened? Tell me now!”</p>
 <p>Under the erupting aura of the overlord, this attendant quivered and suddenly kneeled on the ground: “My lord, this, this is because I was confused and foolish. I noticed that someone had put a high bounty for Young Noble Li’s life on the black market…”</p>
 <p>“... I, I suddenly got greedy while you were busy with the filial ceremonies. I used your seal to command the five generals to ambush Young Noble Li. My lord, please spare my life, I was only momentarily blinded by greed, please spare me!” He slammed his head on the ground while begging for mercy.</p>
 <p>Many of the guests sneered at this scene. The overlord was only finding a scapegoat; who would actually believe this performance?</p>
 <p>“You fool!” The overlord’s eyes lit up with a frightening brilliance: “Sending false orders is an unforgivable sin!”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he reached for the attendant.</p>
 <p>“My lord, spare—” This attendant couldn’t finish his sentence before the overlord twisted his neck off, letting blood spurt everywhere.</p>
 <p>He died with his eyes wide open since it was an indignant death. This wasn’t how things were supposed to go down.</p>
 <p>The overlord put the skull into a wooden box and handed it to Li Qiye: “Brother Li, I have offed his head. I hate deceivers the most.”</p>
 <p>Some sneered after seeing this. A few guests felt disdain towards this act, but no one said anything. After all, the overlord killed his own people and it was none of their business.</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Li Qiye only smiled.</p>
 <p>The overlord lifted the lower section of his robe and kneeled on the ground. He spoke in a serious manner: “Brother Li, you are a hero in the contemporary, I have always admired you and would like to view you as a brother. Even though I am not the culprit, I am still responsible for being too lax with my subordinates. Here, I kneel before you to apologize.”</p>
 <p>People were stunned by this act. No one knew why he was resorting to this method. Keep in mind that he was the sect master of a sea god’s lineage. Someone of his prestigious status would never kneel so easily before people.</p>
 <p>For these sect masters, they would rather die before kneeling and admitting their mistakes.</p>
 <p>But now, the overlord was prostrating, how could people not be dumbfounded?</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1320: The Overlord’s Scheme</b></p>
 <p>People were looking silly due to this unbelievable spectacle. An overlord of a region kneeled so easily. Others would rather have their legs cut off before kneeling, but not the overlord.</p>
 <p>Everyone wanted to see how Li Qiye would deal with this.</p>
 <p>“Really now?” Li Qiye only smiled in response.</p>
 <p>“I know Brother Li won’t trust me.” The overlord sincerely responded: “People say that a man has gold under his knees. Even though I didn’t give the order, it is true that I’m still at fault, so I am kneeling to apologize. However, this might not appease you completely, so I’ll sever one hand to show my sincerity.”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The overlord instantly tore off his left arm. Blood sprayed everywhere as the overlord placed his severed hand on the table.</p>
 <p>The overlord didn’t even bat an eye as he earnestly asked: “Has your anger subsided, Brother Li?”</p>
 <p>This actually shocked the crowd; they stared at the overlord in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Even though cultivators could recreate their bodies when they reached a particular cultivation, the process was costly and required the use of longevity blood. Thus, the stronger a cultivator, the more they cherished their own body.</p>
 <p>What’s more was that for a master, losing one’s arm was extremely humiliating. If an enemy were to cut off their arm, it would be an irreconcilable feud.</p>
 <p>A few started to waver before this submissive display. Could it be that the whole thing had nothing to do with the overlord and the culprit was just his attendant who wanted the bounty?</p>
 <p>Those who had a better understanding of him snorted instead. They knew just how devious the overlord was, so it wasn’t so simple to deceive them.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled after seeing the severed arm: “So you really don’t know?”</p>
 <p>The overlord swore: “If I knew about it, it would have never happened. I admire you like the endless sea, so how could I do such a heartless thing? If I told half a lie, then let the heavens send down its thunder.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye kept on smiling after hearing the vow. Ruyan’s expression was hidden behind her veil so no one could see it. However, a happy spark flashed in her eyes.</p>
 <p>The overlord raised his voice: “If Brother Li still doesn’t believe me and think that I am the mastermind behind all of this, then just have my head to get rid of your anger and enmity.”</p>
 <p>“If Brother Li could discard this hatred, then my death would be worth it.” Having said that, he stretched out his neck so that Li Qiye could wring it off.</p>
 <p>Even more people were persuaded by this display and began to believe his words. The skeptical crowd simply chuckled without commenting.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Li Qiye happily said: “Since you have gone this far, I will believe that this wasn’t carried out by you. Forget about it.”</p>
 <p>The overlord hastily stated: “Brother Li, you are a magnanimous and benevolent man for which I am grateful to the point of tears. No matter what, this was my fault for not properly disciplining my underlings. I’ll bow my head again as an apology.”</p>
 <p>After that, he got down to the ground again and bowed with his head, hitting the ground three times with force.</p>
 <p>At this point, some believed him and felt that both his words and actions were full of sincerity.</p>
 <p>“Such flexibility and ruthlessness, this kind of person will always be successful.” Among the guests, an older cultivator quietly voiced his praise with a sigh.</p>
 <p>A few saw that Li Qiye had accepted the explanation and whispered: “Li Qiye might be fierce, but he is still too inexperienced. Sooner or later, he’ll suffer because of this.”</p>
 <p>After everything was settled, the overlord let the servants bring up his finest wine and poured a cup: “Spilling blood during this celebration must have ruined your vibe, Brother Li. I will drink three cups to apologize.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he drank three cups in quick succession.</p>
 <p>After the gesture, he poured some for Li Qiye and Liu Ruyan before happily smiling: “A toast for Brother Li and Schoolmaster Liu as well as the wise sages of this world. I wish that you will be able to reach the peak and obtain the Heaven’s Will in the future!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and drank without commenting. Liu Ruyan also did the same. The overlord filled their cups once more for another toast: “The entire banquet glows with your presence. Please have another cup, everyone.”</p>
 <p>The slightly unwilling guests raised their cups as well.</p>
 <p>After several rounds from the overlord, Ruyan said: “My tolerance isn’t great, I’ll be leaving first.”</p>
 <p>But the moment she got up, she tumbled and fell back in her chair while shouting: “My, my blood energy has been blocked!”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Li Qiye busily came over to help her up, but the same thing happened when he tried to stand up.</p>
 <p>He blurted: “There’s poison in the wine!”</p>
 <p>Many guests were shocked after seeing the two and quickly channeled their blood energies. However, they found it to be unobstructed; they were relieved to find that their bodies were perfectly fine.</p>
 <p>“It was you!” Li Qiye slumped in his chair and pointed at the overlord while being both frightened and angry.</p>
 <p>“Li, even if you are fierce, you will still have to drink my feet-washing water soon. So what if you are strong? Your boat has capsized.” The overlord smugly laughed.</p>
 <p>“Impossible, the wine was clearly fine, how were we poisoned!” Liu Ruyan was astounded.</p>
 <p>The overlord was very pleased with himself and laughed: “Yes, the wine was fine. If I poisoned the wine, it would have been hard to hide it from you, so I only added a bit of a sinister dragon’s saliva. It will only make the wine taste even more delicious…”</p>
 <p>“... This saliva isn’t poisonous at all, but the two of you are sitting on a chair made out of shadow wood. When the fragrance of this wood is mixed with a sinister dragon’s saliva, it will turn into a dangerous poison, devoiding cultivators of their blood energy and power. I’m sure you didn’t expect this method at all.” The overlord grew complacent as he guffawed.</p>
 <p>“Saliva of a sinister dragon and shadow wood!” People were surprised to hear this.</p>
 <p>A sinister dragon was a very powerful sea creature in Heaven Spirit. Both its saliva and the shadow wood were very precious items. It must have cost a sky-high price for him to obtain both.</p>
 <p>“You! Everything you said earlier was lies? You were the culprit?!” Li Qiye kept on pointing at the overlord in amazement.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, yes, I’m the mastermind behind everything.” The overlord loudly laughed: “That attendant was only a scapegoat! Just a bit of goading from me and someone as arrogant as you would come, so I prepared the bait…”</p>
 <p>“... Geniuses like you think you’re superior and smarter than others. I just needed to kneel and play my part. This might be humiliating for others, but I never valued that kind of reputation. The method doesn’t matter as long as I can achieve my purpose! I simply wanted to make you two drop your guard. I didn’t expect for it to work so quickly, capturing the both of you right now will save me a lot of effort!” He felt quite proud of his plan.</p>
 <p>Ruyan shouted in response: “You dare to do this in front of everyone?”</p>
 <p>This was met with a manic laughter from the overlord: “So what? This is only dealing with a personal vendetta. Many cultivators cherish their reputation, but I don’t care what others call me. A scoundrel? A madman? So be it. Even if the world knows that I have used a despicable method to kill the two of you, so what? They can keep on calling me shameless…”</p>
 <p>“... Plus, if everyone knows that I am the one to torture Li Qiye to death, it would be an even greater accomplishment. Yes, watch me kill my prey, it will only make the process even more satisfying.” His eyes shot out an excited glint.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1321: Skeletal Legion</b></p>
 <p>Many people looked around after hearing this. Cultivators trod a thin line between life and death on a daily basis. Among them were many bad people and villains.</p>
 <p>But once they reached a certain level, they would cherish their reputation, especially the experts with great status; they would be much more prideful.</p>
 <p>Even a devil king, once strong enough, would look down on using despicable means against his enemies. They preferred directly suppressing and slaughtering their enemies.</p>
 <p>Few cultivators would use poisons, it was much rarer than assassinations.</p>
 <p>But now, the Lithodidae Overlord employed such a despicable method in front of the world and even took pride in it. This astonished many of the spectators. They didn’t expect for the play to develop like this since some actually believed his apology earlier.</p>
 <p>Those who understood him weren’t surprised at all. They only snorted as they had seen him do abnormal things like this before.</p>
 <p>Ruyan warned in all seriousness: “Don’t forget that my school’s disciples are right outside.”</p>
 <p>The overlord laughed in response: “Schoolmaster Liu, you have nothing to worry about. As long as you are in my hands, your disciples won’t dare to do anything. Plus, I’ll only be taking Li Qiye’s dog life, there’s no need for us to become enemies. If you want, wait until I kill Li Qiye, then I’ll take you outside...”</p>
 <p>“... Of course, if you refuse, it’s not like I’m afraid of you. I have ways to deal with your disciples if they want to break in.” He revealed a devious smile at this point: “But you need to think about the consequences of opposing me. I have heard of your peerless charm before. If you don’t listen, I will keep you captive and educate you to become my sex slave. At that time, you will be as obedient as a child and become my woman. The Void Imperfection Three Schools won’t have anything to say then either…” He laughed crazily with an evil glare.</p>
 <p>People took deep breaths after hearing this. One of them murmured: “He is really a mad pervert, he’s willing to do just about anything!”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this enough gloating?” At this time, Li Qiye, who was slumped in his chair, smiled.</p>
 <p>“Heh, it is just beginning. Wait a bit, I’ll make you wish for death…” The overlord showed a cruel smile.</p>
 <p>“I kind of hope someone could make me taste such despair. Unfortunately, I have yet to meet them. At the very least, an ant like you won’t be able to.” With that, Li Qiye sat straight again.</p>
 <p>Liu Ruyan did the same and laughed: “Your words from earlier are more than enough to justify my Void Imperfection Three Schools mobilizing to destroy your Regal Valley, but I believe someone else wants to take your dog life more than me.”</p>
 <p>“How, how can this be?!” The overlord’s expression shifted after seeing the two sitting up straight. He quickly staggered backward.</p>
 <p>Ruyan smiled: “You were playing in the mud in some remote corner while I dabbled in poisons. I stopped with such trickeries at the age of seven, only a fool like you would boast about such lowly means.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye simply chuckled. He cultivated the Void Imperfection Physique, so it would be strange if this level of poison could affect him.</p>
 <p>The overlord’s expression turned ugly as he asked: “You, you two were just pretending?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye slightly grinned: “I was just playing along so that I can see your most complacent and smug moment before stomping you down to the ground and shattering your confidence, your hope so that you can taste the sensation of despair and defeat.”</p>
 <p>The situation reversed once more to the astonishment of the crowd. Many didn’t expect for these two to be pretending as well.</p>
 <p>Only the Swiftdao God calmly drank his wine without being surprised at all.</p>
 <p>The overlord suddenly flashed and disappeared. He emerged again on top of a cliff and laughed: “Li, I also didn’t think poison could take you down, but since you are here today, it’s more than enough…”</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” With that, water pillars sprouted around the platform. Each pillar had been refined and reinforced with terrifying flashing runes.</p>
 <p>The Swiftdao God commanded: “Retreat!” His small boat rushed out of the War Cliff like an arrow. The other guests did the same and observed from a distance.</p>
 <p>Fortunately for them, they understood just how devious the overlord was, so they were cautious. Otherwise, if they were to sit on the platform, they would have fallen into this trap as well.</p>
 <p>More splashes came about. The water pillars seemed to turn the area into an ancient battlefield, and the platform was the center with Li Qiye and Liu Ruyan on top…</p>
 <p>“An ancient battlefield…” Li Qiye watched the brilliance gushing from the platform. Of course, the overlord wasn’t capable of creating such a war zone. This was something left behind by his ancestors.</p>
 <p>“Li, my ancestors back then slaughtered millions in a single battle, establishing an eternal prestige. The two of you have been trapped in this ancient battlefield, don’t even dream about escaping.” The overlord loudly laughed.</p>
 <p>The withdrawn guests darted their eyes around and secretly praised their good fortune. Someone even murmured: “It’s good that the Swiftdao God was here so that we didn’t have to sit on the platform or else he would have trapped us all.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was too lazy to take another glance at the battlefield before responding: “Your ancestors established an eternal prestige here because they were indeed capable characters. As for you, an ant is all you amount to.”</p>
 <p>In fact, Li Qiye didn’t place this battlefield in his sight. It had been used by the Lithodidae Sea God. It was once powerful, but after the previous battle, its strength had greatly diminished due to the great damage it suffered.</p>
 <p>“Keep on running your mouth while you still can. In just a moment, you’ll wish you were dead.” The overlord took out a conch-like item.</p>
 <p>“Woo—” He blew the conch. The sound echoed across the region. It was mighty with a majestic and murderous aura…</p>
 <p>A sea demon paragon recognized the conch and exclaimed: “That’s the Divine Sea Conch of the Lithodidae Sea God!”</p>
 <p>“Splash! Splash! Splash!” Something incredible happened. Skeletons started to climb out of the sea after hearing the conch. Their bodies exuded dazzling lights while holding rusted weapons. In the blink of an eye, formations came out alongside a murderous aura.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, these skeletons were once part of a powerful legion when they were alive.</p>
 <p>“What is that?” People understood that this was an experienced legion right away and became quite frightened.</p>
 <p>After leaving the sea, this legion instantly surrounded the ancient battlefield. Not even a drop of water could get through. A conservative estimate was around one hundred thousand. One could easily imagine how terrifying being sieged by them was.</p>
 <p>People uncontrollably shuddered while looking at the dazzling skeletons. They felt death looming over them as if they were trapped in a city of the dead.</p>
 <p>“These are the members that died from the legion that followed the Lithodidae Sea God back then.” A sea demon was startled: “The overlord is using the conch left behind by his ancestors to awaken them.”</p>
 <p>At this time, many understood the overlord’s intentions. He wanted to wake the regiment that was buried here in order to trap Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>This used to be a legion that fought against millions of sea demons and laid out an unshakable status for the sea god.</p>
 <p>Today, he used this ancestral conch to wake them up in order to kill Li Qiye. This method was indeed ruthless enough.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at the legion completely surrounding the battlefield and flatly said: “If your ancestors knew that they had such an unfilial descendant like you, they would definitely crawl out of the yellow spring to end you…”</p>
 <p>“... The Lithodidae Sea God buried his legion here and laid down a great formation to protect their spirits so that they may rest here in peace, a worthy reward for their contribution to his hegemony. But today, you made them come out. Your foolish actions shall make them forever restless.” Li Qiye mockingly smiled.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1322: Cancer Divine Formation</b></p>
 <p>The overlord responded with a crazed guffaw: “The winner takes all so save me the preaching. I am only using these trash. So long as I can kill you, so what if they will never find peace again? They are already dead, mere skeletons. They only exist to be used one last time.”</p>
 <p>The spectators shuddered with chills after hearing this. They thought that his perversion was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>“Woo—” The overlord blew the conch again. The skeletons began their attack under his manic laughter: “Li, it’s time to die. These skeletons are impossible to kill, they’ll torture you to death.”</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Explosions came about while the legion entered the battlefield. The entire place shook under the suppression of their powerful aura. It made people wonder if the battlefield could actually withstand their force once the fight broke out, or would it be torn asunder?</p>
 <p>Someone looked at the 100,000 attacking soldiers and murmured: “A dead legion... This overlord is too merciless, he’s going against his ancestors’ will of letting these heroes rest in peace.”</p>
 <p>“I wonder if Li Qiye can stop this army of the dead?” People watched in anticipation from a distance.</p>
 <p>In the face of this suppressive army, Ruyan chuckled and said: “It’s time for me to play.”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s my turn.” Li Qiye smiled and stood before her. A gigantic death chapter emerged as he took one step up. It crazily expanded and drowned the entire battlefield and sea. It imprinted its mark at the bottom of the sea as well as the battlefield itself.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The death seal was activated. A death energy gushed out like a tsunami, making it seem like the greatest of all calamities. It engulfed this world and seemed to be alive. Individual strands from this tsunami poured into these skeletal bodies.</p>
 <p>It didn’t stop there. With a clunk, the strands successfully implanted themselves. Strands of laws the size of a hair emerged from the death chapter and instantly locked onto these skeletons. Next, the death chapter returned to Li Qiye’s back and began to rotate. The chapter turned bright as its laws controlled the life and death of countless creatures. All of them were in Li Qiye’s grasp.</p>
 <p>Many heard a buzz as soulflames suddenly ignited in the eye sockets of these skeletons. The lit up soulflames were in the color of blood.</p>
 <p>After the emergence of the soulflames, the entire legion suddenly stopped. One could hear a massive sound as they all turned at the same time under Li Qiye’s control.</p>
 <p>They made a circle around him, turning him into the supreme ruler of a dark kingdom.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” People were astounded with their eyes wide open.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” The overlord cried out after seeing that his skeletal legion wouldn’t attack Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>He regained his wits and blew the conch again. However, despite his offensive signal, the skeletons didn’t move at all.</p>
 <p>The conch might have been left behind by the Lithodidae Sea God as a commanding seal for this dead legion, but its power over the dead was far from being comparable to the death chapter from the Death Scripture.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye had boundless death energy and great mastery over this particular chapter, allowing him to easily control this legion of the dead.</p>
 <p>“Do you know what I mean when I said they will never have peace?” Li Qiye faintly smiled: “It means that because of you, they will become my puppets and lose the chance to enter the cycle of reincarnation!”</p>
 <p>The overlord was aghast, he didn’t expect for Li Qiye to have such a move.</p>
 <p>“Is this an evil art?” Many had this notion running in their minds.</p>
 <p>“Li, you are indeed capable, but my means are beyond your imagination.” The overlord regained his confidence and laughed once more.</p>
 <p>With that, he blew the conch to stir the waves.</p>
 <p>“Splash!” The seawater soared into the sky. Sea god runes appeared up above and moved around like blinding stars that illuminated the night.</p>
 <p>“Zzz!” A sharp cry resounded across the Dragon Demon Sea. All of the water in the sky turned into an incomparable array. This gigantic array emitted a primal aura, causing the spectators to tremble. It was as if a monster from the ancient era had awakened.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a monstrous crab appeared in the sky. Its body was made out of water and the runes of a sea god composed its skeleton. Its claws ranged for thousands of miles and could easily crush the earth.</p>
 <p>“Damn, what the hell is that thing?” Numerous spectators felt their legs quivering after seeing this giant crab.</p>
 <p>A royal lord shouted in horror: “It’s the Cancer Divine Formation, the proudest masterpiece in the Lithodidae Sea God’s life.” [1. Cancer as in crab. It’s a constellation in Chinese astronomy. I don’t like using modern/western terms too much, but it was either Cancer Divine Formation or Giant Crab Divine Formation.]</p>
 <p>Those who knew about it slightly trembled after hearing this. Legend states that this great formation was extremely flexible and could move accordingly based on its enemy’s movements just like a living crab.</p>
 <p>Rumor has it that this formation played a great deal in the sea god’s victory against the other sea demons.</p>
 <p>“Li, get ready to die without a grave, my divine formation has already activated.” The overlord laughed boisterously.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the formation in the sky and smiled before he told Ruyan next to him: “Do you know the biggest weakness of this formation? It is too mobile which makes it inferior in space protection. After all, it was meant to protect the souls of the dead in this place.”</p>
 <p>With that, he spread out his fingers and an endless amount of spatial runes emerged. Each of them was extremely complex and obscured.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” His hands flashed brightly. Others began to feel a fluctuation in space. In the blink of an eye, the ancient battlefield, skeletal legion, and the divine formation in the sky were removed from this region and put into their own space.</p>
 <p>“What is this?” Everyone could clearly see that Li Qiye’s surroundings were separating from the main space, making them seem like an illusion.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye explained to Ruyan: “If this divine formation was more static, it would have a much stronger defense so it wouldn’t be this easy to move.”</p>
 <p>This was Space Removal, another space control technique. It could remove an item or an entire sphere away from the main space and trap it in a smaller zone.</p>
 <p>“Woo—” The overlord blew his conch again in the face of this unfavorable development. He ordered the divine formation in its independent space to attack Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“This is the moment.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his right hand, instantly quarantining the space that the divine formation was located from the main space.</p>
 <p>This was the effect of Space Quarantine. Once separated from the main space, if one wasn’t strong enough, they would never be able to make their way back. Even though they looked to be right in front of them, they were in fact quite far away, just like the main space and the separated space.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The divine formation unleashed a strong barrage inside its tiny space. Its gigantic claws could shatter the sky vault. Even the main space began to shake. Everyone felt that if this continued, the gigantic formation would kill its way back to the main space.</p>
 <p>At this time, Li Qiye’s left hand pressured the main space. More spatial runes wove together. A huge portal emerged with countless coordinates inside. It seemed as if every coordinate in the nine worlds could be found within this portal.</p>
 <p>“Clang!” In the blink of an eye, he locked onto a particular coordinate. With a loud bang, a portal emerged on the other end.</p>
 <p>A majestic valley appeared before everyone. It was an island in the shape of a valley with an auspicious and mighty aura.</p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1323: Space Control</b></p>
 <p>Anyone who saw this great island would instantly know that it had experienced countless blessings. A great foundation was laid here, rendering the island untouchable.</p>
 <p>“Regal Valley!” The crowd exclaimed since they knew just what it was.</p>
 <p>At this time, a spatial channel was created to stretch from the War Cliff all the way to the sky of this island. It was transparent and even an army of millions could travel through it at the same time.</p>
 <p>“A spatial channel!” An old paragon blurted out: “How can this be? A spatial channel can only be created by an Immortal Emperor’s dao platform on top of being powered by an incredible amount of Immortal Emperor Refined Jades! There is no way he could open one with his bare hands!”</p>
 <p>A spatial channel was an advanced method of teleportation. It was used by Immortal Emperors to teleport their legions to the rest of the nine worlds for expeditions.</p>
 <p>Compared to regular teleportation, this method was more direct, stable, and durable. More importantly, these passages could delivery larger objects or even an entire legion.</p>
 <p>With such a wide channel like the one Li Qiye had just opened, it could transmit virtually anything.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” At this time, the Cancer Divine Formation finally broke through the barrier and made its way back to the main space.</p>
 <p>“There we go.” Li Qiye noticed the incoming formation and made more spatial runes flow. The tiny space of the formation suddenly turned bright.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye performed Space Shifting to move the formation into the spatial channel.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The attacking formation was suddenly teleported to the sky of the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?!” The overlord’s expression changed into one of horror. He blew the conch and tell the formation to stop its attack. However, the formation was billions of miles away so his order simply couldn’t come through.</p>
 <p>He wanted to jump into the pathway as well, but Ruyan smiled and blocked his path: “It’s a bit too late to leave now.”</p>
 <p>“Kill her!” The overlord commanded his disciples nearby. At the same time, several ancestors rushed out to stop Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The sky quaked as the grand formation unleashed its attack straight towards the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>“Who dares to act impudently at the Regal Valley!” The sudden attack made some ancestors in the valley retaliate. Barriers were erected instantly while experts rushed to the sky in order to stop the formation.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Screams resounded left and right. All the experts rushing in the air were killed by the formation. It kept on reaching for the valley with an unstoppable momentum.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” The entire valley quaked with loud explosions. The formation was too flexible, just like a living crab. It crazily destroyed everything nearby as mountains crumbled.</p>
 <p>More cries could be heard as experts fell to the might of this great formation.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Once the formation reached deep enough into the valley, a mighty sea god’s aura rose to the sky. A second crab rushed out; this one had a majestic aura, even stronger than the first.</p>
 <p>“A second Cancer Divine Formation, this is the valley’s ace!” The people who crossed the spatial channel murmured after seeing this scene.</p>
 <p>“It’s time to launch the attack.” Li Qiye smiled as his death chapter lit up and exuded death energy.</p>
 <p>“Crash!” Even more skeletons climbed out of the seabed.</p>
 <p>In a short period of time, more than a million skeletons lined up around this region. All of them had soulflames in their eyes. The entire region seemed to be enveloped by this death energy.</p>
 <p>This gigantic army stunned everyone. The sheer number of figures made it look like this was a kingdom of the dead.</p>
 <p>“This is the legion from the Roaring Conch and the alliance! They were buried here after dying as well!” An old man who knew about the war back then immediately recognized them.</p>
 <p>“Begin.” Li Qiye smiled and used his Space Removal on the great legion before using Space Shifting to move them all into the spatial pathway. In the blink of an eye, this legion was teleported to the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” They descended from the sky above the valley right away!</p>
 <p>Such a scene was too shocking and made countless people gasp. Just imagine, a million skeletons abruptly showing up in one’s sky — this was quite a terrifying matter! The disciples from the Regal Valley were horrified.</p>
 <p>“Ah—” Before they could calm down, they were met with a terrible slaughter. The skeletal army acted like reapers harvesting the lives of these disciples.</p>
 <p>More screams echoed throughout the valley with blood spraying everywhere alongside beheaded skulls. One fell after another.</p>
 <p>“Kill!” At this time, these disciples had no choice but to shout for battle. They rushed to meet the oncoming army since there was no other way out.</p>
 <p>The spectators were astonished. The Lithodidae Sea God would never have imagined that his own legion and the one he defeated would make their way into the Regal Valley to destroy his lineage.</p>
 <p>The overlord crazily howled: “Die!” His eyes were bloodshot as he gritted his teeth. His disciples and several other ancestors mustered their might in order to make way for the overlord to return to the valley.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how desperately they struggled, they couldn’t break through Liu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>She was the lone gatekeeper taking down one wave of experts after another. Even the ancestors couldn’t do anything under her suppression. Being unarmed didn’t seem to slow her down, it only made her appear even more tyrannical.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” The ancestors began to sacrifice their longevity blood for the next attack. Liu Ruyan exuded a great brilliance and opened an all-devouring black hole.</p>
 <p>Heaven Devourer Evil Physique! This was one of the three great Immortal Physiques of the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Moreover, their physique laws were quite incredible even if they were inferior to the ones from the Physique Scripture.</p>
 <p>More explosions came about. Even the ancestors’ blood sacrifice and altars shattered, unable to handle to retaliation from the powerful evil physique. In just a split second, their altars collapsed along with their bodies.</p>
 <p>Even the overlord was crushed as blood gushed out of his body. If he didn’t have a sea god’s weapon, he would have died under the power of this Immortal Physique as well.</p>
 <p>The crowd was amazed; to many, this was their first time seeing just how strong Ruyan was.</p>
 <p>The overlord was aware of the terrible situation and turned to flee.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” A sword hymn resounded in the sky, accompanied by a slash from another impressive physique. He was shocked at such a magnificent strike and had to use his weapon in response.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Jianshi suddenly appeared before him. She cultivated the Sacred Spring Physique, allowing her to have a boundless and majestic vitality. Even the most ordinary technique powered by this physique would be dozens or even a hundred times stronger than normal!</p>
 <p>Even his sea god’s weapon couldn’t withstand this sky-tearing sword slash and was blown away.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The fleeing overlord was nailed into a cliff.</p>
 <p>The crowd shuddered once more. Ruyan was not the only one who was powerful since Jianshi was just about equal.</p>
 <p>Even experts like the overlord from sea god lineages couldn’t contend against them.</p>
 <p>“The Void Imperfection Three Schools have always been this strong.” Both sea demons and charming spirits felt chills tingling through their spine.</p>
 <p>All along, this sect had always maintained a low-profile. Among the younger generation, Ruyan and Jianshi were not as famous as the Seashield Prince and his peers. However, there shouldn’t be any doubts about their strength.</p>
 <p>Ruyan came closer to look at the nailed overlord and chuckled: “You like to use poison, right? Good, I’ll show you the real way of using poison!”</p>
 <p>It would have been easy for Jianshi to kill the overlord. However, Li Qiye didn’t give the order, so she decided to go easy on him.</p>
 <p>Ruyan took out a wooden thorn as thin as a strand of silk and quickly stabbed it into his forehead at lightning speed.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” The overlord screamed miserably. Even a brute like him couldn’t bear this kind of pain. His mournful cries resounded across the firmaments.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1324: Attack On The Regal Valley</b></p>
 <p>A horrifying scene took place; the overlord’s body actually melted. Even though his eyes were still there, his body turned into a pile of soft, muddy mush. Moreover, roots came out of what was left of his body and stuck along the cliff. He became a horrifying abomination.</p>
 <p>Despite this new form, his sanity was still intact. In fact, he watched the whole grotesque transformation.</p>
 <p>The crowd was frightened after the emergence of this monster.</p>
 <p>Ruyan chuckled in amusement: “Do you know the name of this poison? It is called ‘Back To The Roots’. Not only will your body melt, your true fate will follow suit. If I don’t let you die, you will be hanging here in this abominable form for several hundred years!” [1. The raw is the idiom — falling leaves return to the roots.]</p>
 <p>“Kill me if you dare!” The overlord screamed in a very low tone. It sounded like the roar of an old tree.</p>
 <p>“I will, your funeral will be on the same day as the Regal Valley’s demise.” Ruyan chuckled: “Our Young Noble will force you to watch what you have done. The Regal Valley shall end by your own hands. Your ancestors won’t rest in peace because of you, and the same goes for the sea god’s legion! This is the outcome of your selfishness!”</p>
 <p>The overlord was furious, but nothing was going to change.</p>
 <p>At this time, the two Cancer Divine Formations were fighting each other. The first one was at a disadvantage and was being pushed down. However, even though the second was much stronger, it wasn’t easy for it to sever the claws and legs of the first.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the battle between the gigantic crabs shattered many mountains and barriers at the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>It seemed that doomsday had arrived. The crabs in the sky caused great explosions while the skeletal army continued to kill its way deeper while reaping the lives of the disciples. In a short amount of time, corpses piled into mountains while blood ran like rivers.</p>
 <p>Even if all the ancestors here came into being, they couldn’t reverse the present situation. Not only did they have to face their progenitor’s legion, they also had to fight his opposing legion.</p>
 <p>Their ancestors might have been victorious back then and slew millions, but now, these millions of sea demons were having their revenge!</p>
 <p>“Rumble!” As the assault raged on, a divine light appeared and soared for endless miles from the depths of the valley.</p>
 <p>A great figure emerged in this brilliance and with it the aura of a sea god. Billions of existences in this sea trembled and had to kneel in worship.</p>
 <p>Some people saw the figure through the spatial channel and cried out: “Lithodidae Sea God!”</p>
 <p>“It’s the foundation of the sea god, not him.” An expert explained: “The skeletal army has finally woke it up. I wonder if this legacy can withstand it or not?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, little animal, the foundation laid down by my ancestors is unbreakable. You can keep on dreaming!” The overlord laughed hysterically after seeing the tall figure.</p>
 <p>As a sea god lineage, Lithodidae created this sect back then and left behind an eternal foundation to protect the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>Today, the offense had finally woke it up along with the will of Lithodidae.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This tall figure raged over the world and used its incredible aura to suppress the skeletal army.</p>
 <p>However, the army did not panic or become afraid. They mounted their most powerful assault against this foundation by forming war formations. A sea of skeletons spanned as far as the eyes could see. In just a moment, it looked like this invincible legion had returned to life.</p>
 <p>However, these war formations couldn’t withstand the pressure from the great aura. One skeleton shattered after another. They failed to break through this barrier erected by the will of a sea god.</p>
 <p>“That’s a sea god for you, the supreme sovereign of our sea demon race.” Some sea demons felt proud after witnessing this scene.</p>
 <p>“Little animal, all of your calculations have failed, your tricks can’t compare to my ancestors’ invincibility!” The overlord turned even crazier after seeing this scene. His voice was incredibly hoarse at this point.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye nonchalantly responded: “Only the will of a sea god. It might be a bit interesting if it was an Immortal Emperor’s will controlling a true weapon, but this sea god’s remnant doesn't even have the Trident. Watch how I will destroy your hope and the Regal Valley.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he personally entered the spatial channel and descended towards the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>After he left, Ruyan and Jianshi guarded the channel. If anyone wanted to cross it, they must go through the two girls first.</p>
 <p>Once he appeared in the sky, the glaring eyes of the figure instantly swept towards him like two divine swords capable of cutting through everything in this world.</p>
 <p>However, before these two rays could touch him, he suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>It looked as if this will of the sea god noticed something was wrong. Its eyes lit up like two suns illuminating the entire valley. Without a doubt, it was searching for Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>Logically, no one should be able to hide from such a powerful intent regardless of their methods.</p>
 <p>However, the luminous eyes failed to find a single trace of Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” Even some powerful paragons couldn’t believe it while watching the spatial channel.</p>
 <p>A paragon exclaimed in astonishment: “Even though a sea god’s will is not as strong as the real deal, it is still the intent of a sea god. They are built upon a great foundation, so even Apex Godkings are wary of them and ordinary Godkings can’t hide from their sweeping search!”</p>
 <p>This was Cryptic Space, one of the four major arts of the Space Scripture. Not to mention an intent, even if a real sea god were here, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to spot Li Qiye without spending some time.</p>
 <p>This technique could hide anything from everything, even the heavens. Even if the user was an inch away, the opponent still wouldn’t be able to detect them.</p>
 <p>While the crowd was amazed by Li Qiye’s stealth technique, something finally changed in the valley. The space here suddenly turned blurry as if it was about to melt.</p>
 <p>Although it was blurring up, the background coordinates of this spatial region became quite clear. It seemed that this location was trying to connect to a different space.</p>
 <p>At this time, the sea god’s intent finally found Li Qiye. Its sharp gaze came for his neck once more.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The cryptic space was exposed under this strangulating search. Li Qiye appeared in the sky again while channeling a spatial law in his palm.</p>
 <p>As the intent was about to attack him again, Li Qiye said with a smile: “Too late.”</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Tremendous explosions resounded across the Dragon Demon Sea. The whole region began to tremble.</p>
 <p>The background of the region became clear. A huge maelstrom emerged right behind the Regal Valley.</p>
 <p>“The Great Maelstrom!” Everyone lost their minds after seeing this gigantic whirlpool. Even paragons turned pale as they shouted its name.</p>
 <p>Someone uncontrollably blurted: “Impossible! How can the Great Maelstrom appear in our sea?!”</p>
 <p>At this time, the souls of many sea demons left their bodies in fear. If the maelstrom was really here, then the end of the Dragon Demon Sea as well as their race was coming.</p>
 <p>“No, this isn’t the maelstrom appearing in our sea. Li Qiye is connecting two different spaces.” A shocked master elaborated while heaving a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The sea god’s intent had no time to deal with Li Qiye now. It immediately turned back to fight against the power of the maelstrom.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” A burst of breaking noises resounded. Even though the intent wanted to stabilize the space around the valley, it was already too late. The foundation built by Lithodidae began to crack in many places.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled after seeing this scene: “This is Space Connection. What a shame, one wrong step is all it takes to lose everything. If the foundation didn’t take action and continued to protect the valley, I wouldn’t have been able to connect the valley’s space to the maelstrom’s space.”</p>
 <p>Space Connection was the next level of spatial teleportation, a technique even more advanced than spatial channels. It was part of the Space Control art as well.</p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1325: Massacre</b></p>
 <p>Space Connection was different from spatial portals and channels. The latter two acted as bridges from one place to another.</p>
 <p>Space Connection was something else. It could connect everything in two different spaces. For example, it could direct the flow of seawater from one space to another. This was why it was more advanced than the other two types.</p>
 <p>At this time, Li Qiye has connected the spaces of the valley and maelstrom. He used the relentless power of the maelstrom to tear apart the sea god’s foundation.</p>
 <p>If the foundation chose to defend the Regal Valley from the start, it would have been much more difficult for Li Qiye to complete the connection as it would require much more resources and effort. However, the foundation was activated and all of its power was focused on the sea god’s will in order to destroy the skeletal army.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the foundation grew lax on guarding the Regal Valley’s space, creating a hole for Li Qiye. At the same time, the maelstrom’s space was immobile and rigid; it was countless times stronger than the valley’s. This led to the power of the whirlpool channeling itself into the valley’s space in a natural manner.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Within a short period of time, the foundation was torn apart by the maelstrom. Without its power, the sea god’s intent lost its strength and turned bleak right away. At this point, it wouldn’t be able to protect the Regal Valley any longer.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the entire valley was sucked into the maelstrom. Under the Space Connection, everyone could see the valley appearing in the maelstrom’s space.</p>
 <p>“No…” The overlord pitifully screamed with his hoarse and nebulous voice.</p>
 <p>“Clank, crack!” The entire valley was ground into little pieces by the maelstrom and sucked into its depths. The whole region vanished!</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The valley’s space was destroyed as well, so the connection was severed. The maelstrom disappeared before everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>At this point, what initially used to be the Regal Valley was now a void zone. Everything had returned to the origin. It was as if nothing had ever existed in this place. All traces of the valley and the Lithodidae Sea God have been erased. From now on, these existences would only exist in legends.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye returned to the War Cliff using his spatial channel and casually cut it off. He stood in the sky with an air of indifference. Faces paled when met with his sweeping glare.</p>
 <p>It could be said that from beginning to end, Li Qiye didn’t personally attack the Regal Valley. He only controlled space in addition to the skeletal army; that was more than enough to annihilate the Regal Valley!</p>
 <p>A sea god’s lineage disappeared just like that. There was no supreme master or imperial weapons, just exquisite space manipulation.</p>
 <p>Anyone who carefully thought about this matter would shudder in fear.</p>
 <p>After a long time, a great character murmured: “Li Qiye has mastery over space from cultivating a wondrous secret technique.”</p>
 <p>Many cultivators struggled to regain their minds from this scene. All along when it came to merit laws, outside of fate and longevity laws, techniques were widely discussed.</p>
 <p>The more pertinent ones included offense, defense, and suppression. Of course, there were also techniques that involved banishment and sealing, but these were rarely used on the real battlefield.</p>
 <p>As for space controlling abilities, it was even rarer. Few cultivators were capable of cultivating these types of laws; most could only use it as a side branch and wouldn’t focus on it as their main study.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s actions today were a real eye-opener. People got to witness the terrifying power of space control.</p>
 <p>One could even say that by grasping this art, one could sweep through all enemies while always being in a safe position.</p>
 <p>“Controlling space was the same as grasping the fundamental basis of war.” Someone murmured after calming down.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s display was very shocking, but it also filled people with regret because this was a rarely researched field.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye returned and looked at the overlord hanging on the cliff. He chuckled and said: “Treating me as prey? You still think you're qualified to do so? You are no different from an ant in my eyes. I normally wouldn’t bother dealing with an ant, but unfortunately, you lack all sense of propriety, thinking that an ant like you could hunt a true dragon! So not only did I crush an ant like you, I also put an end to your ant’s nest as well!”</p>
 <p>He paused for a moment before continuing: “I put you and your valley down not because we are enemies nor because you tried to ambush me, it was only because I found you to be an annoyance. Someone who chases after prey to satisfy your own perverted desires…”</p>
 <p>“... If, say, you were personally going on the hunt using your own abilities to kill your prey, then I would find your courage admirable. Alas, a descendant of a sea god would choose to use such despicable means and even drag down the entire Regal Valley. Look now, I have done you a favor. You are finished, and so is the valley.” He ended with a sneer.</p>
 <p>“Winner takes all, there is nothing else to say. Do as you will!” The overlord was lost in despair with no other thoughts in his mind.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye snorted: “You think you deserve that phrase? Someone like you isn’t qualified to even enter the stage to be a competitor, you’re only a common street thug at best.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s words were quite merciless, but no one questioned him. He had earned the right to say them.</p>
 <p>Moreover, most people didn’t like the overlord and his devious nature. It was just that they were wary of the valley’s power in the past, so they didn’t voice their displeasure.</p>
 <p>Now, both the valley and the overlord were finished. Many were secretly applauding, but some felt a bit of regret since the entire valley was annihilated. Remember that this was a sea god’s lineage. It must have countless treasures hidden in its trove along with spirit grasses and divine trees. If one could take down the valley, just these resources alone could have lasted them a lifetime.</p>
 <p>The overlord shouted with his dull voice: “Kill me if you dare!”</p>
 <p>“Killing you will only dirty my hands. The only reason you are still alive is so that you could watch the valley being destroyed.” Li Qiye smiled then looked at Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Ruyan smiled back: ”If you wish for it, he can live here for several hundred years. To borrow his own words, ‘a fate worse than death’.”</p>
 <p>“He’s only an ant, there’s no need to show off my cruelty by letting him scream for hundreds of years.” Li Qiye chuckled in response.</p>
 <p>She replied: “If that’s the case, then I’ll send him off. It’s about time anyway.”</p>
 <p>The overlord didn’t try to struggle. He slowly closed his eyes since the valley was destroyed and his game was over. Even if he lived on, he had shamed his ancestors as the sinner of the Regal Valley!</p>
 <p>To the hopeless overlord, death was no longer frightening, it was a type of relief.</p>
 <p>Ruyan flipped her palm and a wooden thorn flew out. It was the poisonous thorn that pierced the overlord’s forehead earlier.</p>
 <p>After it was pulled out, the overlord rooted in the cliff suddenly withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. Next, his body turned into powder and dispersed into the sea. There was not the slightest trace of him remaining, a true death.</p>
 <p>The poison was true to its name, he returned to his roots. In the end, the victim would return to the soil in their entirety.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye turned to leave the War Cliff after watching his death. However, in this split second, a ray shot forward from the same cliff where the overlord took root earlier. It was too sudden.</p>
 <p>There was no one there, thus this attack was completely unexpected. Having just killed his enemy, Li Qiye was at his most vulnerable moment. Who would expect for someone to ambush him right now?</p>
 <p>This ray was even faster than a meteor or lightning. It instantly stabbed his back. It all happened too quickly as the assassin was only inches away from him. Liu Ruyan couldn’t even call out in time before the ray made contact.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1326: Second Assassination Attempt</b></p>
 <p>Everyone saw this ray pierce through Li Qiye’s back with incredible speed. Time seemed to have frozen into a vivid image, depicting his downfall.</p>
 <p>Many people stopped breathing; it was as if an invisible hand was clutching their throats. Ruyan’s and Jianshi’s hearts jumped out of their chests.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s power was as clear as day when he easily destroyed the Regal Valley alone.</p>
 <p>However, such a great genius basking in triumph was assassinated. This sudden reversal of plot was a bit unbearable.</p>
 <p>After the cold glint penetrated Li Qiye’s back, the assassin finally revealed herself. It was Sima Yujian!</p>
 <p>No one saw her hiding in the cliff, not even experts like Ruyan and Jianshi.</p>
 <p>One must admit that she was a capable assassin. Not only was her stealth matchless, she could seize the most opportune moment to deliver a fatal blow, evident by what had just transpired.</p>
 <p>There was no better opportunity to kill Li Qiye than that moment. In this split second, she thought that she had succeeded.</p>
 <p>However, she quickly felt that something was amiss.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye was indeed standing there and her sword had pierced through him. Alas, there was no gushing blood or miserable screams.</p>
 <p>He stood there quietly without any reaction, as if the sword had pierced someone else.</p>
 <p>She was aware of the problem. At the same time, an older big shot outside of the War Cliff also noticed the anomaly.</p>
 <p>He exclaimed after the realization: “He isn’t in this space.”</p>
 <p>People were surprised to hear this. They didn’t expect for Li Qiye to not be in this space. It was a huge distance, but no one saw him take flight.</p>
 <p>This was Displaced Space, another technique in Li Qiye’s arsenal. One could clearly see the person standing there and would feel that they were mere inches away. However, there existed an unreachable gap of one or several different spaces.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” Yujian realized this right away. Her long sword turned radiant as if countless suns had just exploded. With this empowerment, the blade traveled with a speed faster than time itself by ten-fold!</p>
 <p>It pierced through time and space to reach Li Qiye’s space, aiming for his neck.</p>
 <p>She was indeed remarkable and her speed had reached the extreme. To be able to react so quickly and adapt to his new space, anyone would have been skewered by her swift reaction speed regardless of their space mastery.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, fortune eluded her. Her opponent just happened to be Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The terrifying sword glint stopped right before Li Qiye. His two fingers were gripping her sword.</p>
 <p>While looking at the emotionless girl, Li Qiye chuckled and flatly stated: “Not bad, your sword speed is enough to reign over the younger generation. You have done a good job cultivating the Godslaying Dao. Unfortunately, you have met me.” [1. This title can mean Godslaying or Death God/Reaper. It’s a coin toss before the author gives more context.]</p>
 <p>Yujian’s expression showed signs of fear. After leaving the sacred ground, no one knew which dao she was cultivating until now.</p>
 <p>She decisively abandoned her sword and turned to flee. However, she was quickly stopped after banging into an invisible wall that blocked her path.</p>
 <p>Space Closure, a technique that allowed Li Qiye to seal off this space right when Yujian tried to escape. It didn’t matter which direction she chose since there would be an invisible wall there to stop her.</p>
 <p>However, she was much more powerful than the five generals. At this moment, her body exuded strands of brilliance alongside a cold energy. They seemed to be sword rays capable of severing all things.</p>
 <p>These bright lights condensed into a single ray. She used an unmatched speed to slam into the spatial wall.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The closure began to have multiple cracks.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” She gathered her speed once more and managed to break through Li Qiye’s Space Closure, successfully escaping the trap.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t make it far before Li Qiye casually pointed his finger forward. The space around her suddenly squeezed together and turned into chains.</p>
 <p>“Click!” A transparent light engulfed her body and formed a gigantic lock.</p>
 <p>At this time, her speed suddenly slowed down despite her efforts to accelerate.</p>
 <p>Space Shackle was Li Qiye’s choice this time. It was quite powerful, capable of rendering its victim unable to move. Moreover, it was omnipresent, there was no escaping once sealed.</p>
 <p>Yujian was quite powerful; her speed could be ranked among the top in Heaven Spirit. Even under such restraints, she was able to fly like before.</p>
 <p>“I want to see just how strong you are.” Li Qiye smiled and took one step forward to instantly catch up to her.</p>
 <p>He attacked with his Hell Suppressing Fist.</p>
 <p>The grand dao shattered along with the sky vault. Countless mountains came crashing down with their immense weight. There was no way of measuring its boundless power capable of annihilating the earth and ending the gods.</p>
 <p>Yujian was aghast in the face of this terrifying punch. She didn’t have time to think and exuded her blood energy. Darkness loomed over her as if she had been possessed by a devil. This dark light gave birth to a pair of sun-blotting wings behind her.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the wings folded in front of her like two hands of a dark god to stop Li Qiye’s blow.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This divine possession wasn’t enough. The dark wings faltered before his fist. Even the space around her was crushed completely.</p>
 <p>As for Yujian, she was blown away with blood gushing out of her wounds. Her face turned pale.</p>
 <p>In this moment of life and death, she lifted a cannon decorated with a coiling dragon onto her shoulder. It was completely black, seemingly made from the body of a dark dragon.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The weapon shot out a blazing ray like moonlight. It was transparent and dazzling as it soared with extreme speed.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, it was unbelievably sharp and instantly pierced through space to head straight for Li Qiye’s throat.</p>
 <p>This flame traveled for a long time before the sound of the explosion came. One could easily imagine just how swift it was.</p>
 <p>Even a God-Monarch was stunned silly after seeing this incredible attack. He could already see the scene of it piercing his throat, instantly killing him.</p>
 <p>It moved so fast that timed seemed to stop. Everyone was watching a slow-motion picture from its emergence.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled. His inner physique lit up and his agility surged. The moment the Soaring Immortal Physique comes out, it would exceed all else in speed.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he unleashed an Indestructible Diamond Fist straight at the blazing flame.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This slow-motion scene amazed the crowd. The flame shattered like glass. Its sparkling traces of light scattered everywhere. The sound of the impact came long after the actual event.</p>
 <p>Yujian was astonished once more. The Godslaying Dragon Cannon was one of her aces. She didn’t have many shots left, so she wouldn’t use it unless her life was on the line.</p>
 <p>There was no return after the cannon gets fired. It had extreme speed and horrifying destructive power, even a Godking’s weapon would be instantly pierced. This was the weapon she used to assassinate the White Whale Godking.</p>
 <p>However, it could only shoot once before becoming useless for a period of time. She didn’t expect to fail in damaging Li Qiye in the slightest because she wasn’t aware of his counterattack and Immortal Physiques.</p>
 <p>Under the acceleration of the Soaring Immortal Physique, Li Qiye’s Indestructible Diamond Fist had incalculable power. Even a magical blow from the dragon cannon couldn’t withstand its might.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1327: Godslaying Dao</b></p>
 <p>She was intimidated while standing there. Her mind didn’t return and she had forgotten about fleeing.</p>
 <p>“The world still has a few Godslaying Dragon Cannons?” Li Qiye gave an amused smile while looking at the blank-minded girl.</p>
 <p>She was shocked and regained her wits to run once more.</p>
 <p>This was met with Li Qiye’s quip: “It’s too late to run now. Come, accept your imprisonment.” With that, his five fingers spread out and aimed straight for her.</p>
 <p>His palm covered the heaven and earth and suppressed myriad realms. Regardless of her efforts, she couldn’t escape from his grasp.</p>
 <p>Right when she was about to be trapped within his attack, a sword left its sheath with a loud hymn.</p>
 <p>Someone took action. His sword came sweeping by and turned into countless majestic mountains — profound and steady. It came straight for Li Qiye’s gigantic palm.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Li Qiye’s attack shattered the countless mountains before him. The attacker just now staggered backward as well.</p>
 <p>“Swiftdao God!” People blurted in surprise after seeing who it was.</p>
 <p>The person who saved Yujian was the current lord of the Swiftdao Sacred Ground, her junior brother.</p>
 <p>He quickly cupped his fists towards Li Qiye and said: “Brother Li, you are a great man. Won’t you be magnanimous this time and let it go?”</p>
 <p>She refused to accept his help and coldly uttered: “Scram, I don’t need you to take care of me.”</p>
 <p>The Swiftdao God’s expression didn’t change as he earnestly said: “Senior Sister, protecting every disciple of the sacred ground is my duty.”</p>
 <p>“I am no longer someone from the sacred ground. Get the hell out of my sight.” Yujian’s expression was cold, choosing not to show any gratefulness.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, you have not been expelled from the sacred ground, so you will always be considered its disciple.” The celestial god shook his head.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye looked at the two and became amused: “Such love between fellow disciples, which one of you will come first to die?”</p>
 <p>“Li, I dare to accept the consequences of my own doing. I will fight you.” The girl still had a surging bloodthirst and a will to fight with the sword in her hand.</p>
 <p>The celestial god, on the other hand, started to beseech Li Qiye: “Brother Li, my sister only wanted to use this chance to polish her grand dao, I hope you can forgive her once. Our sacred ground will pay for your losses.”</p>
 <p>She coldly stated: “I have nothing to do with the Swiftdao Sacred Ground!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smirked after seeing the exchange between the two and eventually said: “I’m someone who finds mercy to be a noble quality. Since you were able to escape from me once, I shall also spare you this time.”</p>
 <p>He coolly left after stating this with a laugh.</p>
 <p>Yujian and the celestial god were stunned after seeing this. The celestial god naturally didn’t think that Li Qiye was afraid of him. Someone like Li Qiye simply wouldn’t put anyone in his sight.</p>
 <p>He only walked a couple of steps away before turning his head and smilingly told Sima Yujian: “The next time we meet, I hope you will have the Coiling Dragon Sword in hand. Don’t let me down.”</p>
 <p>With that, he finally left with Ruyan and Jianshi.</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian stood there looking silly. She didn’t expect such a result after the failed assassination since she was mentally prepared to die. However, what stunned her even more was that Li Qiye knew about the Coiling Dragon Sword! No one should know about its existence.</p>
 <p>In fact, she wasn’t the only one who looked silly, many people were astounded all the same. They didn’t expect for someone as ruthless as Li Qiye to easily forgive her like this.</p>
 <p>From his previous conduct, they knew that opposing him wouldn’t end well. For example, the Lithodidae Overlord; he even took the Regal Valley down with him.</p>
 <p>But now when Yujian tried to assassinate him twice, Li Qiye actually decided to spare her. People began to wonder if Li Qiye actually had a merciful side.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured: “He is completely unpredictable.”</p>
 <p>Yujian calmed down and glanced at the celestial god before leaving without saying anything.</p>
 <p>The celestial god told Sima Yujian: “Senior Sister, why not return to our sect? Master and the others miss you.”</p>
 <p>However, she turned a blind eye to him and disappeared into the horizon without giving him a second glance.</p>
 <p>The celestial god gently sighed without commenting. He sheathed his sword before placing it on his back and seated himself in the small boat to take his leave as well.</p>
 <p>The others saw that the play was over, so they left the War Cliff for the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>The news of the Regal Valley’s destruction spread overnight. Many people listened to the process and were quite frightened. Li Qiye was now even more renowned in the world.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Evil Devourer School’s boat continued forward towards the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>On the boat, Li Qiye sat quietly with Ruyan and Jianshi to his left and right. Jianshi was boiling some tea for him while Ruyan peeled some fruit and personally fed him.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, are you friends with Yujian’s seniors?” Jianshi grew quite curious after seeing Li Qiye spare Sima Yujian. He was not the merciful type to spare her just because of the celestial god’s plead.</p>
 <p>Ruyan fed another fruit straight into his mouth before smiling: “Do you really need to think about this? It’s so obvious, Yujian grew up to be quite pretty, so Young Noble spared her this time in order to make her warm his bed later.”</p>
 <p>Of course, she was only joking. Shangguan Feiyan and Gongsun Meiyu were both peerless beauties, yet Li Qiye killed them ruthlessly and decisively. He didn’t spare them just because they were pretty. Therefore, he didn’t spare Yujian for her beauty, it must have been some other reason.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye glanced at the vast sea and eventually answered: “She has a connection with me from cultivating the Godslaying Dao. I suppose you can say that her seniors are my old friends.”</p>
 <p>He plunged into quiet contemplation afterward.</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian probably didn’t know that the Godslaying Dao was created by Li Qiye when he was still the Dark Crow.</p>
 <p>During the dark years of the Ancient Ming’s reign, they were mighty and ruled over the nine worlds. This was especially true during Immortal Emperor Tian Tu’s prosperous generation when his race reached their peak.</p>
 <p>In that period, Li Qiye’s military might couldn’t compete in an all-out war against the entire Ancient Ming, so he chose to use indirect methods.</p>
 <p>He created the Godslaying Dao and established the Godslaying Night Corps. It could be said that this was the most prominent and terrifying assassination group. [1. Night probably stands for his name and the nature of the corp. Ye = Night.]</p>
 <p>He led this assassination corp to kill many geniuses from the Ancient Ming, the ones with the potential to become invincible. They took it a step further by initiating complicated long-term assassinations against this race’s supremes in order to weaken them.</p>
 <p>The godslaying corps never showed themselves to the world and remained in the darkness. However, they set up many opportunities for the eventual victory, so it was full of accolades and merits.</p>
 <p>When the Ancient Ming Era ended and the Emperors Era ushered in, a new dawn emerged for the nine worlds.</p>
 <p>At that time, the Godslaying Night Corps had completed its mission. There was no longer a need for assassinations.</p>
 <p>It stopped training new assassins. The older generation began to die from old age or hid in seclusion, and their leader chose to live in seclusion as well.</p>
 <p>Before he left, Li Qiye handed control of the corps over to the leader, including the manuals of the Godslaying Dao, the Coiling Dragon Sword that represented the highest authority of the corps, and the Godslaying Dragon Cannons.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye told the leader that it was up to him to decide whether to continue the corps or not. He didn’t know what they ultimately chose.</p>
 <p>Later on, he never saw them again. The Godslaying Night Corps disappeared from this world, and no one trained in the Godslaying Dao.</p>
 <p>Sima Yujian’s appearance had let Li Qiye see the dao and the cannon once more. This was the reason why he chose to spare her. Otherwise, he would have killed her on the second assassination attempt.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi didn’t pry any further after seeing his quiet contemplation. The atmosphere became very quiet as the two continued with their chores.</p>
 <p>The Bonesea was lively once again. Many great powers and imperial lineages in Heaven Spirit flocked to this region. Even old monsters who didn’t come out before made appearances.</p>
 <p>This was one of the twelve burial grounds. It was located in a remote area of the Dragon Demon Sea, and it was also the most dangerous and mysterious location.</p>
 <p>However, there was one very strange aspect about it. Legend states that every single sea god would travel to the Bonesea at least once. No one knew the reason, however.</p>
 <p>There was one particular speculation. People thought that the Trident came from the Bonesea, so all the sea gods would come to see it.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1328: Puresun Daoist</b></p>
 <p>The flying gulls soared above the waving sea. The boat from the Evil Devourer School continued on with adequate speed while many cultivators quickly passed them.</p>
 <p>Of course, some were even slower than Li Qiye. As Li Qiye’s group continued to move forward, they spotted a carefree youth.</p>
 <p>This was a young man a bit more than twenty years old with an old mottled sword on his back. He wore a yellow robe the color of sunlight and gave off a solitary feel.</p>
 <p>He didn’t appear to be outstanding, but he made others feel that he was rock-solid like an immovable mountain.</p>
 <p>His eyes were bright, but within them hid an indescribable loneliness and a profound silence. This youth rode a wooden plank above the waves.</p>
 <p>It looked quite shabby in comparison to the other experts and big shots with their treasure boats and divine vessels. This youth, with his wooden plank, seemed to be on a lower level in comparison.</p>
 <p>Ruyan and Jianshi were both surprised to see him after passing by. When the youth saw them, his sentimental expression turned into a smile. He initiated the conversation: “Schoolmaster Liu and Schoolmaster Zhuo, it has been a while, about ten years? You two are becoming even more beautiful.”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect the Puresun Island Lord, who is so indifferent to fame and fortune, to actually come to the Bonesea.” Ruyan smiled back at this youth.</p>
 <p>He gave a carefree smile in response: “People in this world cannot be freed from wanting fame and fortune. Something is happening at the Bonesea, and as the island lord, I have to go broaden my horizons as well.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi gracefully responded: “So you are coming for the item of immortality.”</p>
 <p>The youth shook his head: “How could a mundane man like me dare to think about a fortuitous item like that? Being a cultivator of Heaven Spirit, it would be a shame to never visit the Bonesea at least once. Today, I’m making an exception to join in on the fun.” With that, he cupped his fists towards Li Qiye and asked: “Brother Li, do you mind if I tag along on the schoolmaster’s boat to the Bonesea?”</p>
 <p>This young man was very polite. Moreover, he asked Li Qiye instead of Ruyan. It was a very interesting and deliberate act.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye leisurely smiled: “I don’t mind, get on.”</p>
 <p>The youth smiled and jumped on the large boat. He bowed towards Li Qiye and said: “I am Daoist Puresun from the Ancient Spirit Island.”</p>
 <p>“I know who you are.” Li Qiye chuckled and glanced at the sword on the daoist’s back. With an intrigued smile, he said: “I have been wanting a decorative sword, and the one you have looks quite nice.”</p>
 <p>The daoist’s sword was quite old and ragged. Even though it had an ancient style going for it, there was nothing extraordinary in appearance, making it seem to be an ordinary old sword.</p>
 <p>Ruyan smilingly quipped: “Are you listening? Our Young Noble wants your sword. Will you hand it over nicely, or do we have to take it from you?”</p>
 <p>The daoist wryly smiled. He was still at ease and generous with his response: “Brother Li, you are matchless in the current generation, so how could a sword of this level be to your liking? Even though this Ancient Purity Blade isn’t bad, it isn’t good enough for you to rob me. Unfortunately, this sword belongs to the school. If it was my personal belonging, I could have gifted it to you.”</p>
 <p>If an outsider was present to hear this name, they would be jumping from astonishment. The Ancient Purity Blade was Immortal Emperor Gu Chun’s true fate weapon. This was an unfathomable weapon with many colorful legends.</p>
 <p>This seemingly young man was Daoist Puresun, one of the island lords of Gu Chun’s four branches. He looked around twenty, but his real age was much older.</p>
 <p>“So many words just to refuse.” Ruyan chuckled and wanted to encourage Li Qiye: “You might be a powerful Godking, but there is still a long way to go before you can compare to our Young Noble…”</p>
 <p>“... Young Noble, if you want to sweep through Heaven Spirit, it is best to attack this daoist right now. If you take him down, the rest like the Seashield Prince and Seven Sea Goddess won’t matter. Even though he isn’t famous, he is definitely the number one genius of our charming spirit race, someone who became a Godking ten years ago.” She playfully winked at Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>The daoist coughed after hearing this and replied: “Schoolmaster Liu, you are praising me too much. If you use your Charming Evil Strike from your Heaven Devourer Evil Physique, I am not your opponent.”</p>
 <p>The progenitor of her school was an invincible Immortal Physique user at grand completion. Even though she didn’t become an Immortal Emperor, she was able to create the Charming Evil Strike.</p>
 <p>In theory, a grand completion user shouldn’t be able to create an Immortal Physique Strike. However, this progenitor’s demon-like talents were too amazing. She created this technique the moment she reached grand completion.</p>
 <p>There was still a gap between her technique and those created by Immortal Emperors. To be exact, her technique was considered a secondary Immortal Emperor Strike.</p>
 <p>“A descendant of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun while cultivating the Indestructible Diamond Physique, these are excellent achievements.” Li Qiye nodded while looking at the daoist.</p>
 <p>The four branches were in the following order: the Ancient Spirit Island, the Puresun River, the Profound Sea Dynasty, and the Golden Era Palace. They were all created by Immortal Emperor Gu Chun and separated later on.</p>
 <p>According to the rumors, the Ancient Spirit Island was ruled by his direct descendants. The Puresun River was built as a lineage for a grand completion Immortal Physique master, the Indestructible Diamond Physique, to be exact. He created the famous Diamond Evil-subduing Physique Law, the only physique law of this level in the four branches.</p>
 <p>The Profound Sea Dynasty was created by Immortal Emperor Chen Hai and, of course, the Golden Era Palace was built on the fame of Immortal Emperor Yan Shi. [2. Chen Hai = Profound Sea; Yan Shi = Golden/Prosperous Era.]</p>
 <p>Despite being divided into four branches, they were still part of the same family and would regularly exchange merit laws and information.</p>
 <p>For example, this daoist came from the Ancient Spirit Island, but he still cultivates the diamond physique.</p>
 <p>The daoist immediately stood up and said: “Brother Li, you are scaring me. My little cultivation shouldn’t matter to you.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye replied with a grin: “Don’t worry, I have no intention of messing with your four branches. At the very least, if your sect doesn’t provoke me, I won’t be coming to break your nest.”</p>
 <p>He quickly said with sincerity: “I can rest easy now after hearing this.”</p>
 <p>Earlier when Ruyan called him the greatest genius of the charming spirit race, it was the truth. Not only did he have a half completion Immortal Physique, he became a Godking ten years ago. These were amazing achievements.</p>
 <p>Other youths would shock the world by becoming a Godking at such a young age, but the daoist wasn’t very famous in Heaven Spirit.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t only because he was low-key, it was also because he had no ambition to compete with others. He preferred to travel calmly without needless thoughts and desires. This made his cultivation even stronger despite his unknown reputation.</p>
 <p>Many people didn’t even know who he was. Those who did might not know the extent of his strength. The Void Imperfection Schools had ties with the Ancient Spirit Island, so they knew his real strength.</p>
 <p>The powerful daoist was very insightful as well. The moment he saw Li Qiye, he didn’t dare to put on airs.</p>
 <p>“But really, the Ancient Purity Blade is not bad at all.” Li Qiye added right after the daoist became relieved: “I’m actually missing a sword, maybe I should think about taking it?”</p>
 <p>The daoist felt awkward once more as he replied: “Brother Li, you are too funny.”</p>
 <p>“If this was any other true treasure, I wouldn’t actually care for it.” Li Qiye said in a serious manner: “However, this blade is extraordinary and contains a great mystery.”</p>
 <p>Such earnest words left the daoist speechless and the two girls smiling.</p>
 <p>“I’m just messing with you.” Li Qiye added after seeing the slightly alarmed daoist: “This sword is not bad, but I wouldn’t have waited until now if I truly wanted it.”</p>
 <p>The daoist cupped his fists and said: “Brother Li, this little brother is very grateful for your generosity.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve: “The four branches have remarkable contributions to the nine worlds. The descendants of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun are wise as well.”</p>
 <p>“However, I do have a bit of enmity with your four branches. Whether this escalates or not will depend on your sect.” He smiled after saying this.</p>
 <p>The daoist’s heart jumped after seeing his smile. He felt that Li Qiye actually wanted the four branches to come looking for trouble, like a lamb walking into the jaws of a tiger.</p>
 <p>The daoist was certain of this and earnestly answered: “My junior brother is a great man, I’m sure he will know how to tread.”</p>
 <p>It was no secret that Li Qiye killed Gongsun Meiyu, the Profound Monarch’s concubine. Everyone knew that he was very fond of her, so he might not be able to swallow this anger.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the daoist felt quite confident. This was not because of their sect’s power, but because he had a deep friendship with the Profound Monarch. He understood the monarch and his personality, so he believed that he would be able to take care of this enmity.</p>
 <p>Of course, Li Qiye didn’t really take this problem to heart. If the monarch wanted revenge for his concubine, he would be ready.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye kept on looking at the sword behind the daoist’s back with some longing. He eventually smiled and said: “I know that your Golden Era Palace has many beauties as well. Besides the sword of your four branches, I’m also interested in the palace.”</p>
 <p>Of course, he wasn’t interested in the beauties but some things that Immortal Emperor Yan Shi left behind.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1329: Bonesea’s Entrance</b></p>
 <p>Daoist Puresun smiled to respond to Li Qiye: “If Brother Li comes to my four branches, I’m willing to be your guide. We can take a tour of the Golden Era Palace. With your charisma, I’m sure you will have a considerable harvest there. Humans and our four branches have deep ties, so I know you can be at home there.”</p>
 <p>The daoist’s words were reasonable. Immortal Emperor Yan Shi was a human. Moreover, the human bloodline at the palace and even the entire four branches was doing very well.</p>
 <p>Ruyan was quite amused as she playfully said: “The truth is that the Golden Era Palace Master is a supreme beauty. Just one glance at her could enamor countless others. Young Noble, the daoist can introduce you to her. With your peerless charm, I’m sure you can win her heart.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled as well and asked the daoist: “Is this the truth?”</p>
 <p>The daoist hesitated for a moment: “Well…”</p>
 <p>Even the elegant Jianshi chuckled. It was clear that Ruyan was toying with Daoist Puresun.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You don’t want to introduce your martial aunt to our Young Noble?” Ruyan’s enchanting posture was quite bewitching.</p>
 <p>The current palace master was the daoist’s martial aunt. It wasn’t because she was older than him, it was just that she was one generation above him.</p>
 <p>The daoist turned red and awkward. He became quite hesitant unlike before. He eventually answered: “If there is a chance when you visit us, I will certainly introduce you to her.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi slightly shook her head after hearing this: “Puresun, you are courageous and wise and your talents are peerless. Unfortunately, there are a few things…”</p>
 <p>She didn’t finish her sentence.</p>
 <p>“Young Noble, did you hear that? You must visit the palace. If there is a chance to win her over, you mustn’t disappoint the daoist.” Ruyan was just like a little demoness. Her swaying laughter belonged to a devil.</p>
 <p>The daoist knew that Ruyan was deliberately trying to be annoying, but he couldn’t do anything outside of smiling awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye instantly knew what was going on after seeing the daoist’s expression.</p>
 <p>At this time, a disciple came in and reported: “Schoolmaster, we have arrived at the Bonesea.”</p>
 <p>“We’re here.” Both the girls stood up from excitement.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s eyes turned serious. He went to the deck to look at this region before smiling: “Things are going to be exciting again.”</p>
 <p>In front of them were incomparable mountains blocking everyone’s path. They appeared without warning as if they were guardians preventing everyone from entering.</p>
 <p>The spectators felt an illusion that the Dragon Demon Sea ended right here. These mountains ahead were not part of a mountain range, there were tiny gaps among them. Of course, they were small relative to the huge size of the mountains. But for the people here, they were large enough and could accommodate many big ships side by side.</p>
 <p>This huge gap in the center of the row of mountains gave the feeling that a mountain had collapsed here for some unknown reason.</p>
 <p>If one could stand in the sky of the Dragon Demon Sea and look down on this long row of mountains, they would find that they seemed to be a lower jaw.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for the flowers and vegetation, these mountains would look like a series of teeth.</p>
 <p>If there was an inverted row of mountains in the sky, then it would make up the upper half of the jaw. The missing part in the center would be a missing front tooth.</p>
 <p>Of course, the majority wouldn’t believe that this was a row of teeth because it spanned across the Dragon Demon Sea for millions of miles. Its length was too long to be imagined.</p>
 <p>If it was truly the lower half of a jaw, then just how frightening was this monster? It could swallow the entire Heaven Spirit World!</p>
 <p>After going through these mountains, another ocean appeared before them. However, there was a distinct difference between this one and the previous.</p>
 <p>The water of the Dragon Demon Sea was incomparably blue with waves everywhere. However, the sea ahead was turbid as far as the eyes could see, making it seem to be a gateway to hell. A chilling sensation assaulted all spectators. This feeling was especially true while standing on the collapsed mountain.</p>
 <p>In fact, this analogy wasn’t unreasonable. Those who had been to the Bonesea before knew that this was only the entrance and not the Bonesea itself.</p>
 <p>The experienced crowd knew that one would only know what true fear was when they actually reached the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>There were many cultivators waiting at this gap between the mountains and the ridges nearby. This was because everyone was waiting for the boneships. Without them, there was no way of getting to the Bonesea regardless of the treasure used.</p>
 <p>The first-timers didn’t believe this statement too much. After waiting for a long time and seeing how none of the boneships have come, someone grew impatient and said: “Is this sea really that bizarre? My heirloom boat can travel across anything, I don’t buy that it can’t cross this sea.”</p>
 <p>This skeptic summoned his boat. It was indeed extraordinary since it was exuding a divine light. It slowly sailed into the muddy waters. However, it didn’t reach more than a hundred feet before it began to sink. Next, some clattering sounds came about. This treasure ship completely sank into the sea and disappeared.</p>
 <p>The cultivator witnessed the whole scene and was dumbfounded due to disbelief. His ship had an amazing origin and was capable of crossing through all seas, but it has now sunk. He quivered in horror and praised his fortune for not being on it when it sank, or else his life would have been forfeited.</p>
 <p>An older cultivator told the youth: “How could it be that easy to enter the Bonesea? Not to mention you, even a Godking would drown in those muddy waters.”.</p>
 <p>A sea demon added: “The Bonesea spares no victims. Even the most incredible ship would sink, and yours is no exception. In terms of evasion and purification, no one is better than the Immaculate Expanse. But its master, Daoist Lin, would still obediently wait here for a boneship. His Void Imperfection Physique is virtually invincible, yet he still doesn’t dare to test his luck. Don’t mess around without a boneship.”</p>
 <p>A cultivator stated: “I heard that outside of the Sea Conch, no one else dared to not use the boneships to enter.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, the Sea Conch is an exception.” A sea demon replied: “Rumor has it that their progenitor, the Conch God, obtained a bunch of Yin bones and crocodile wood. With them, he was able to create some vessels that could cross the Bonesea.”</p>
 <p>A charming spirit suddenly interjected: “Is Daoist Lin here right now?”</p>
 <p>“Not just the daoist, the Extreme Yang Monarch, the Swiftdao Celestial God, they’re all here too. This trip to the Bonesea will be very lively.” An old cultivator responded: “Towering waves will rise with the arrival of Meng Zhentian as well.”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, someone murmured: “A duel of geniuses?”</p>
 <p>A paragon chimed in: “That day will come, but Daoist Lin’s group should be fine. They don’t have a strong desire for the Heaven’s Will. However, the celestial god and his peers must have the Heaven’s Will. A great battle is inevitable.”</p>
 <p>A charming spirit master mused: “But who can compete with Meng Zhentian? The celestial god might be strong, but his current self can’t contend against Zhentian.”</p>
 <p>Many people pondered these words. Even though some people didn’t want to believe it, it was indeed the truth. No one was qualified to compete against Meng Zhentian, at least for now.</p>
 <p>“Fierce is here.” During the silence, someone with good vision spotted Li Qiye’s ship.</p>
 <p>Many turned around. Sure enough, the giant boat of the Evil Devourer School slowly drifted into the gap. The cultivators nearby quickly made way for them.</p>
 <p>Even if it wasn’t for Fierce’s notoriety, just the name “Evil Devourer School” was enough for everyone here to back off.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1330: Boneship</b></p>
 <p>The giant boat went into the gap and Li Qiye’s group came out to the deck. They gazed at the muddy sea in front of them.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators felt envious after seeing Ruyan and Jianshi standing next to Li Qiye. For many people, to have such beauties by one’s side was an incredible stroke of luck. Moreover, they were famous rulers of their respective regions.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Daoist Puresun was recognized by only a few people. Those who might have heard of his title had never seen him before.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye flatly commented: “How many existences have been buried here at the Bonesea...?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, someone suddenly called out: “The boneships are here.” Sure enough, several groups of ships were coming closer.</p>
 <p>They were ships seemingly made out of bones of varying sizes. The bigger ones could accommodate around ten people while the smaller ones were the size of a canoe.</p>
 <p>All of them had some skeletons lying onboard. They were wearing their own clothes that had rotted completely, but this indicated that they were once living beings or cultivators.</p>
 <p>“Time for us to board.” The cultivators in the gap grew restless and wanted to board.</p>
 <p>“Why do you get to go first? Our three sects arrived here before you, so we should be first.” An expert became unhappy right away.</p>
 <p>“Okay, let’s not argue. If we fight before we even get to the Bonesea, we won’t ever get there.” An influential paragon stepped out and said: “We’ll follow the rules. The three Cloud Ballads and the six schools from Shallow Waters were here first, so they get to board. Then the next groups...” The cultivators had no objections to this paragon taking charge of the situation and prepared to board.</p>
 <p>When the boneships finally arrived at the edge of the muddy sea water, they automatically turned around and headed back for the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>A senior immediately shouted once the ships were close enough: “Go.”</p>
 <p>Shortly after, many cultivators jumped and got on the closest boats. Many first-timers heaved a sigh of relief after boarding.</p>
 <p>“Get ready to fight.” However, the experienced cultivators turned serious and took out their treasures.</p>
 <p>At this time, the fallen skeletons’ eyes turned red as if something was fueling their soulflames. Their figures slowly stood up one after the other.</p>
 <p>They grabbed the mottled weapons next to them and headed for the cultivators near them. Some howled wildly and opened their mouths to take out some strange treasures before going on the offense.</p>
 <p>“Kill!” The cultivators retaliated with a battle cry. Even if they weren’t from the same sect, they worked together.</p>
 <p>Another old cultivator shouted: “Watch it, don’t sink the boat or we’ll be done for.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, how come these skeletons aren’t attacking you?” During this chaotic melee, some cultivators noticed that their peers weren’t being attacked and found it quite surprising.</p>
 <p>One of them happily gloated: “Heh, I bought some expensive talismans from Old Chu back at Bones Island so I don’t have to worry about them.”</p>
 <p>A strange-looking talisman was attached to him. The skeletons on the ships didn’t seem to notice him. Even if they attacked those next to him, they completely ignored him.</p>
 <p>“I also bought some from Old Chu.” After seeing this, many others calmed down and took out their wooden boxes then put these talismans somewhere on their bodies.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!” However, despite putting on a talisman, a skeleton still attacked them with its blade.</p>
 <p>He jumped and shouted: “What the hell? I also have a talisman.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, you don’t know? These talismans are very specific. If you bought a very expensive one, then there will be no problems. However, if you bought one for cheap, then you better change it for another.” An experienced cultivator found this quite amusing.</p>
 <p>The cheapskate immediately put on a different talisman. Sure enough, the skeleton stopped attacking him and went for other people.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! I’ve changed five talismans already.” A different cultivator put on many different talismans, yet he was still being attacked. His talismans were completely ineffective.</p>
 <p>“Ah—” A miserable scream sounded. One of the cultivators used up all of his talismans, but he was still being targeted. He couldn’t handle the attacks of the skeletons and was quickly disposed of by three of them.</p>
 <p>“Never be too stingy.” The old cultivator saw this and shook his head to say: “Even though one can buy some good items for cheap from Old Chu, the chance of them being effective is minuscule. Paying an exorbitant price guarantees the quality.”</p>
 <p>“Ah—” In the following moments, screams sounded left and right on these boneships. Some of the cultivators weren’t strong enough even when working together and were killed by the skeletons.</p>
 <p>“Push them into the sea!” An experienced cultivator loudly shouted and joined forces to take down these skeletons.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” With the help of this powerful cultivator, a group finally took over one of the ships after throwing the skeletons into the sea. They couldn’t swim at all and sank into the depths.</p>
 <p>“Crack!” However, some were unlucky. One cultivator inadvertently pierced the ship and the sea water rushed in.</p>
 <p>“You’re insane!” Everyone on the ship turned pale from horror after seeing this.</p>
 <p>One of the cleverer cultivators managed to jump to the closest boneship. The slower ones sank with the ship into the water without having the chance to even scream.</p>
 <p>More ships drifted towards the Bonesea while screams and battle cries echoed from them. The two sides were still vying for supremacy.</p>
 <p>After clearing the ships of skeletons, the cultivators could only sit there and let the ships take them away since no one could control the direction.</p>
 <p>“More are coming.” After the first batch floated away, another group came along.</p>
 <p>An old man commanded his disciples: “Get ready, don’t be disorderly once we board.”</p>
 <p>Another battle broke out on this second boarding as well. More ships continued to come. The majority of the cultivators could easily jump on them, but the weaker ones would be killed by the skeletons.</p>
 <p>After a few batches of ships, a large one finally came. It was several times larger than the previous ships and could contain several hundred cultivators.</p>
 <p>The presiding paragon immediately asked: “Whose turn is it?”</p>
 <p>The crowd looked around at each other. A schoolmaster explained: “We all know that the larger the ship, the stronger the skeletons inside. Even if it is our turn, we aren’t strong enough to seize this ship.”</p>
 <p>This schoolmaster was being very realistic. Even though this huge ship was very tempting, they needed to be strong enough to seize it.</p>
 <p>“We’ll go then.” This paragon worked with the other paragons and took their juniors up onto this ship. Another great battle broke out.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s group was still watching on the deck. Li Qiye smiled and told Liu Ruyan: “Get ready, we’ll board in a bit. This trip will be dangerous, so don’t take your disciples along.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan immediately sent the command. Even though the disciples really wanted to take a look at the Bonesea, they let go of this thought due to the nature of the trip. They didn’t want to drag their schoolmasters down.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye went back inside and told Xiong Qianbei: “Since I have promised to take you to the Bonesea, prepare yourself. Whether you can get anything is up to your own fortune.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Young Noble Li and schoolmasters, for leading the way.” After hearing this, the excited old man bowed and went to prepare.</p>
 <p>After sitting down, Li Qiye looked at the calm Daoist Puresun and smilingly asked: “What is your purpose for coming to the Bonesea?”</p>
 <p>The daoist replied with a smile: “I want to take a look at the mythical central area.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye shook his head in response: “You are indeed very strong and capable. However, you should forget about the central area. If something unfortunate were to happen to you there, it would be a great loss for the charming spirits, the Heaven Spirit World, and the four branches because of your innate talents.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye rarely praised others, so his words were indicative of the daoist’s strength.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll wait until I’m stronger.” The daoist easily abandoned this notion without forcing the issue.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye said: “There are other interesting places at the Bonesea. Just wait, you will come to find that this trip will not be in vain.”</p>
 <p>The daoist cupped his fists in response: “Then I’ll leave it to Brother Li to guide us.”</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1331: Profound Sea Monarch</b></p>
 <p>While Li Qiye was chatting with Daoist Puresun, a loud commotion came about. A person descended from the sky and aroused the attention of the crowd.</p>
 <p>This was a youth adorned with a dragon robe and an imperial crown. He carried great momentum just like an emperor on a tour of his kingdom.</p>
 <p>Countless God-monarch rings rotated around his body. Each of them had a god in the center, so it looked as if he had thousands of gods protecting him in addition to millions of citizens in worship.</p>
 <p>When his rings came together, a towering figure emerged. It gathered the faith of billions, allowing it to be enveloped by his blood energy. This boundless figure didn’t look like a shadow at all. Instead, it was more like a true god. It stood behind him and quietly protected this youth.</p>
 <p>This figure could instantly suppress all paragons and weaker God-Monarchs. The youth didn’t need to do anything, just this figure alone could sweep through all of his enemies!</p>
 <p>“Now this is a True Monarch!” The older paragons were slightly astonished. They understood the significance of the shadow behind him.</p>
 <p>When a cultivator reached a certain level within the paragon realm, they could think about opening up their own territory. This was especially true for those who were capable of entering the path of the grand era. They would contemplate starting their own sects or establishing a branch within the existing one.</p>
 <p>This was because at this particular level, they could accept the tributes of their citizens, allowing them to grow stronger with the blood energy of their vassals. This benefited both their cultivation and battle prowess. On the battlefield, there was a great difference between those who were receiving tributes and those who weren’t.</p>
 <p>As for paragons that reached the True Monarch level, not only were they worshipped by their citizens, they would have become deified, thus being nourished by a great amount of blood energy.</p>
 <p>Someone shouted after seeing the youth: “Profound Sea God-Monarch!”</p>
 <p>“The king of the Profound Sea Dynasty!” Even those who had never seen him before were shaken after hearing his title.</p>
 <p>This dynasty was part of Gu Chun’s four branches.</p>
 <p>An older knowledgeable cultivator with great insight saw the shadow behind him and emotionally stated: “This monarch is quite unfathomable. Not only is he decisive and ambitious, he is also blessed with good fortune. He wants to expand his dynasty’s territory.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I heard he could be considered an exceptional individual among the dynasty’s wise sages who have helped expand the dynasty.” Another charming spirit from the Abyss Sea movingly added: “He treats his citizens quite well, which is why he possesses this powerful visual phenomenon.”</p>
 <p>“With so much blood energy from his citizens empowering him, I don’t think anyone is stronger than him at the True Monarch level.” Another paragon from the previous generation made this verdict.</p>
 <p>Opening more territories was very beneficial to paragons of this level. Because of this, many great powers would have numerous branches erected by their own paragons. Of course, this alone wouldn’t be enough. It was not difficult for a True Monarch to expand their territory since they would have ample power to seize lands by force.</p>
 <p>Administration was required for these new territories. Only when one could let their own citizens prosper would they be rewarded during the ceremony for the divine investiture. Their citizens would offer even more vitality, relative to the population and level of prosperity.</p>
 <p>There was an old saying in the mortal world: if one’s belly wasn’t full, they wouldn’t be thinking about worshipping some random deities or devils. Only when your citizens are blessed by your rule would they grow stronger from a peaceful life. With that, their blood energy would invigorate the territory and the ruler. The stronger the citizens, the stronger the True Monarch after the inauguration process.</p>
 <p>However, it wasn't easy to run multiple kingdoms and bless them with prosperity. Because of this, many God-Monarchs would abandon their administration and choose to cultivate instead. They would, in turn, use spirit medicines and pills to make up for the lack of energy from their citizens.</p>
 <p>Even though this was an inferior method, it still gave them a chance to surpass the True Monarch level and perhaps even reach the Godking realm. Nevertheless, this had its disadvantages and shortcomings. With a sufficient amount of blood energy, these True Monarchs could become something even greater than an ordinary Godking. They could become entities praised as World Dominating Godkings, Nine Worlds Godkings, or even a mythical Emperor Assailant.</p>
 <p>“The Profound Monarch might not have the ambition to become the Immortal Emperor, but he is aiming to be an Emperor Assailant.” An experienced paragon commented after seeing the great amount of vitality strengthening the shadow behind the monarch.</p>
 <p>He was correct. Many talented prodigies could easily surpass the bottleneck of being a True Monarch. However, they couldn’t govern their citizens well enough, so during their divine inauguration, they would fail to receive a great amount of blood energy. Later on, they could still become a Godking, but they would be limited to the Grand Godking or Heavenly Godking levels.</p>
 <p>A cultivator who understood him couldn’t help but state: “His edge is far beyond that compared to the other True Monarchs. Look, he has the right hand of god!”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, many shifted their attention towards the monarch’s right hand. It was different from the rest of his body. His hand was as white as jade and even more exquisite and beautiful than a woman’s hand. It was as if it was carved from a perfect piece of jade; it gave off an unparalleled gentleness.</p>
 <p>Such a flawless hand was beyond criticism. It was no wonder why people would call it the right hand of god.</p>
 <p>Someone curiously asked: “What is the power of this right hand?”</p>
 <p>The cultivator who knew about it shook his head: “I’m not quite sure. I heard those who have seen the power of this hand are all dead. Some believe that it is quite mighty, others state that it could change something from being rotten to magical. It might even contain the mysteries of the gods.”</p>
 <p>Under the eyes of the crowd, the monarch boarded the Evil Devourer School’s boat and went inside.</p>
 <p>This garnered everyone’s full attention because the feud between him and Li Qiye was no secret. They all knew that Li Qiye killed his favorite concubine.</p>
 <p>He walked into the internal compartment in a domineering manner as if he was the sole ruler of the world. His eyes swept through the room and saw Daoist Puresun. Despite his imperious temperament, he still bowed and cupped his fists respectfully: “Senior Brother, long time no see.”</p>
 <p>He might be a preeminent character to outsiders, but he was still the daoist’s junior brother and showed no signs of arrogance in his presence.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, Junior Brother. Your divine ceremony was quite perfect, it has paved a straight path for you into the future. It is only a matter of time before you surpass me.” The daoist stared at the figure behind the monarch and couldn’t help but voice his praise.</p>
 <p>“I cannot compare with you, Senior Brother.” The monarch smilingly said. Despite his arrogant nature, this sentence was quite sincere.</p>
 <p>He thought very highly of himself, but he understood his limits very well when standing before his senior brother. Others might not have seen the daoist’s matchless talents, but after growing up with him, he knew of his brother’s invincibility and power more than anyone!</p>
 <p>The daoist only smiled in response.</p>
 <p>At this time, the monarch’s gaze fell upon Li Qiye. It turned quite cold like two divine blades, sharp enough to sever all creations.</p>
 <p>He lowered his tone: “You are Li Qiye!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smilingly replied: “That’s right.”</p>
 <p>The glint that flashed in his eyes gave off a commanding pressure. No one would question his power since he was among the top ranking members of the younger generation. He stated: “You killed my concubine!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye remained seated there leisurely: “If your concubine’s name is Gongsun Meiyu, then yes, I killed your concubine.”</p>
 <p>The cold aura of the monarch bloomed even more. He chillingly said: “Do you know the consequences of opposing me?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t.” Li Qiye was still all-smiles: “However, I know the result of those who antagonize me. A light sentence would be death, a heavy sentence would be sect destruction.”</p>
 <p>The daoist only sat there with a smile while watching this confrontation between the two.</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1332: The Profound Sea Monarch’s Decision</b></p>
 <p>After hearing Li Qiye’s response, the monarch’s eyes lit up with an oppressive bite. An imperial aura emerged. Even paragons would feel pressured under his momentum.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye was completely unaffected and nonchalantly sat there.</p>
 <p>The monarch slowly uttered while maintaining his glare: “It seems like you are full of confidence. Do you think you alone can sweep through the entire Heaven Spirit World?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “No. I know that with my own strength, it is more than enough to ravage the entire nine worlds!”</p>
 <p>Anyone else would find Li Qiye’s words to be blasphemously haughty. Ravaging the nine worlds was a statement no one would say outside of Immortal Emperors.</p>
 <p>The glint in the monarch’s eyes sharpened during this staredown. His whole mind was focused on Li Qiye, as if he wanted to figure out something by looking into his eyes.</p>
 <p>One with a haunting gaze and one seated leisurely — this went on for some time.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the monarch dispersed his horrifying momentum and converged his aura before speaking: “No matter how strong you are, there is always someone stronger. It was her lack of propriety for opposing you, she didn’t understand the immensity of the heaven and earth.”</p>
 <p>Many would be surprised to hear these words come from the monarch. One must remember that Li Qiye killed his favorite concubine, yet he wasn’t trying to obtain revenge right now. It was simply inconceivable.</p>
 <p>“Profound King, I actually thought you were here for revenge.” Ruyan came out after finishing her tasks. She smiled after hearing his response.</p>
 <p>Because the Profound Monarch was also the king of the Profound Dynasty, others called him the Profound King as well.</p>
 <p>The monarch faintly smiled in response: “Schoolmaster Liu, I will repay certain enmities. If my concubine’s killer was on the same level as me, I would absolutely kill them not only for revenge but also to establish my authority!”</p>
 <p>She charmingly quipped: “Then what about my Young Noble? Are you saying that you are not on his level?”</p>
 <p>The monarch gave Li Qiye a cold glance and snorted without answering Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye sat there and chuckled: “This is a bit surprising. Anyone else would have a hard time enduring this anger.”</p>
 <p>The monarch scowled: “Don’t be surprised. If it wasn’t for the fact that I am unable to see through your true power, I would have made mincemeat out of you. It was her fault for being blind and seeking her own death by opposing you.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan asked: “Hey now, Profound King, these words are too frank. Are you not afraid that your other concubines will be hurt from hearing this?”</p>
 <p>The monarch responded: “Schoolmaster, there’s no need to goad me. She was only a woman, this isn’t enough for me to involve the entire Profound Dynasty. Moreover, I gave her wealth and prestige. She, on the other hand, didn’t find me strong allies and instead only provoked a supreme enemy. Her death was her own fault.”</p>
 <p>The monarch betrayed all expectations. No one would be able to endure their favorite concubine being killed, yet he could let go of this grudge and not try to obtain revenge.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and told the monarch: “Interesting, sit down for a drink.”</p>
 <p>The daoist finally spoke at this time: “Brother, why not come with me to the Bonesea? We can support each other.”</p>
 <p>The monarch cupped his fists towards the daoist before glaring at Li Qiye to say: “Senior Brother, I appreciate your goodwill. However, my willingness to forego this grudge does not mean that I want to befriend him. Even though I do not want revenge, I still don’t like him. There’s no need for the drink.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye clapped his hands approvingly, quite pleased with the response. He said: “Very straightforward, how interesting. Because of this response, I will spare your life even if we become enemies later on!”</p>
 <p>The monarch didn’t reply to such domineering words. He gave Li Qiye one last side-eye before turning around to leave.</p>
 <p>However, he suddenly stopped after remembering something. He turned and asked the daoist: “Senior Brother, it has been a few years, have you made any progress with Senior Aunt?”</p>
 <p>“Brother, what are you saying?” The daoist blushed and shook his head.</p>
 <p>The monarch stared at him and pressed on: “Why bother hiding when it has reached this level? You aren’t the only one who knows this, even she herself knows about it! As the saying goes, don’t let one’s own fertile water flow into others’ fields. She is such a beauty, yet you still want her to marry an outsider? If you like her, you need to make a move!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t try to egg me on, I have my own discretion.” The daoist’s face became hot as he glared at the monarch.</p>
 <p>“Stop, Senior Brother, I know you too well. Everything about you is excellent outside of your lack of ambition! If I had your talents, I would have reached for the Heaven’s Will already. This Meng Zhentian or whatever, I would have cut him down! You are blessed with an unparalleled aptitude, yet you’re wasting it away by idling about!” The monarch showed a disdainful look.</p>
 <p>He continued on: “Nothing can be done about that, one does not necessarily have to become an Immortal Emperor. However, if you don’t even dare to chase after the woman you like, then you would be failing your supreme blessings even more! Senior Brother, you must reconsider. If you don’t court her, someone else will win her over. She has many suitors in Heaven Spirit, after all.” With that, the monarch finally left.</p>
 <p>The daoist only wryly smiled without responding to the monarch.</p>
 <p>Many eyes were staring at the giant boat outside. They thought that a fight would break out between the monarch and Li Qiye. However, they were surprised to see the monarch leave. How could such a prestigious character endure this anger?</p>
 <p>Nobody knew what was going on, but they didn’t dare to comment in the presence of the monarch.</p>
 <p>The monarch didn’t care for their opinions either and boarded a boneship to head towards the Bonesea.</p>
 <p>Back inside the boat, Li Qiye drank a nice cup of tea given to him by Jianshi. He smiled at the daoist: “Your junior brother is an interesting fella.”</p>
 <p>The daoist smiled back: “He has always been like this. We grew up together and he’s perfect outside of being a bit arrogant and competitive. The Profound Dynasty — in his hands — will be able to shine.”</p>
 <p>The daoist was much greater than the monarch in terms of talents and power. However, the two had a great friendship. The monarch never held any jealousy towards his excellent senior brother.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, he felt regret for his brother. In his opinion, the daoist could compete for the Heaven’s Will and perhaps be the most likely candidate as well.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the daoist didn’t have this ambition. He chose the path of the grand era instead of the heavenly path. More importantly, he never cared for fame and wealth, so despite holding immense power, he was relatively unknown.</p>
 <p>The monarch himself chose the path of the grand era because of his brother. If someone as matchless as his brother didn’t obtain the Heaven’s Will, then it would be too tasteless for an inferior person like him to reach for it.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smilingly said: “However, your brother is right. If you don’t dare to chase after someone you like, it would be an affront towards your innate gifts.”</p>
 <p>The daoist couldn’t find an answer to this comment and let out a hollow laughter.</p>
 <p>He liked the Golden Era Palace Master. However, as his martial aunt, she was one generation higher than him. This left him in a difficult situation.</p>
 <p>After all, they were a magnificent sect in Heaven Spirit. Countless lineages and charming spirits viewed them as leaders. If he married his martial aunt, it would indeed be improper given his sect’s reputation.</p>
 <p>“The Puresun Island Lord is incredible regarding cultivation, but unfortunately, you treat a few matters in the way women do.” Ruyan chuckled: “Just as the Profound King has said, if you waste this opportunity, won’t you regret it for the rest of your life?”</p>
 <p>Both the Void Imperfection Three Schools and Gu Chun’s four branches were leading charming spirit lineages as well as allies. The two powers mingled a lot, so Liu Ruyan also knew about the daoist’s love for the Golden Era Master. In fact, this was no secret in the four branches; any disciple with a bit of influence knew about it.</p>
 <p>The daoist quietly pondered for a moment before letting out a sentimental sigh. Shortly after, he said: “Morality and ethics, what can people say about them? Even if I can cross this hurdle, my aunt might not be able to.”</p>
 <p>“How can you say that without trying?” Li Qiye grinned: “Make an attempt before coming to a conclusion. Plus, your four branches aren’t that pedantic about morality. Your ancestors, Immortal Emperor Gu Chun, Immortal Emperor Chen Hai, and Immortal Emperor Yan Shi, aren’t so old-fashioned in the first place.”</p>
 <p>The daoist was still hesitant, not knowing how to voice his feelings.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye laughed and patted his shoulder: “Give it a try. The opportunity is in your hands. If you fail to grasp it, it won’t be there any longer. If such a day comes, you will regret it, and remember, there is no medicine for regret.”</p>
 <p>The daoist quietly nodded.</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1333: Meng Zhentian’s Enticement</b></p>
 <p>As the group was preparing to depart for the Bonesea once more, someone else came to visit.</p>
 <p>A boneship floated from the Bonesea with two people on board, one old and one young.</p>
 <p>The old man looked extraordinary with a sword on his back. This sword was thick and huge, a great contrast to his own stature. Though he hid his aura, there were sharp glints in his eyes like unstoppable sword strikes, evident by his suffocating sword dao.</p>
 <p>As for the youth, many people knew that it was Bao Yujiang from the Dream Empyrean.</p>
 <p>An older character immediately recognized the old man and blurted: “Cao Guojian!”</p>
 <p>“Cao Guojian?” Others shuddered after hearing this name.</p>
 <p>This was Meng Zhentian’s youngest disciple. Rumor has it that he became Zhentian’s direct disciple after joining the Dream Empyrean during the Difficult Dao Era.</p>
 <p>Although Meng Zhentian didn’t spend a long period teaching Cao Guojian about cultivation, his talents shined during this arduous generation. It was difficult to find a suitable opponent for him during his youth. Others praised him as the best swordsman in Heaven Spirit. Ultimately, he reached the peak by becoming an excellent God-Monarch.</p>
 <p>Keep in mind that it was exceedingly difficult to even become a paragon during the Difficult Dao Era, let alone a God-Monarch. After this era ended, he eventually became a Grand Godking.</p>
 <p>It has been said that if he hadn’t been born at the wrong time, he could have become an invincible Godking. Even if he couldn’t become a Nine Worlds Godking, he would at least be a World Dominating Godking.</p>
 <p>Cao Guojian disembarked his boneship and boarded the Evil Devourer School’s boat. He told the disciples here: “Dream Empyrean disciple, Cao Guojiao. Under the orders of my master, I am here to see Schoolmaster Liu and Schoolmaster Zhuo.”</p>
 <p>Many cultivators slightly trembled after hearing this, especially the experienced ones who smelled something different in the air.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Meng Zhentian has begun to recruit the heroes of this world?” A sect master murmured to himself after making this prediction.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that Meng Zhentian wanted to become the Immortal Emperor. These candidates didn’t need to antagonize everyone in the world. In fact, throughout history, many great powers were willing to form an alliance with promising candidates.</p>
 <p>This sudden visit from Cao Guojian under Meng Zhentian’s orders had a different feeling to it.</p>
 <p>An insightful elder murmured: “If the Void Imperfection Three Schools form an alliance with the Dream Empyrean, he will become a tiger with wings. His path towards Immortal Emperor will be even easier.”</p>
 <p>Despite being low-key, the Void Imperfection Schools were still a behemoth of the Charming Spirit Race and Heaven Spirit as a whole. It held a pivotal position in the worldly order.</p>
 <p>If they were to ally with the Dream Empyrean, then not far in the future, the four branches might do so as well.</p>
 <p>If it came down to this, Meng Zhentian would be completely victorious. No one would be able to stop his army.</p>
 <p>Inside the boat, Ruyan and Jianshi heard the message from the disciples. Their eyes darted at each other and then Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>In their opinion, their schools would definitely follow Li Qiye. He could make any decision in their stead.</p>
 <p>The daoist sitting to the side smiled and said: “The guest comes bearing ill-will.”</p>
 <p>The daoist was quite a character, so he naturally understood the reason for Cao Guojian’s visit.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and added: “I like this type of guest the most. Wouldn’t it be boring if everyone was agreeable all the time? Only blood and bones will paint the path of an Immortal Emperor, one full of passion and fun.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye’s nonchalant attitude left the two girls with helpless smiles. Even someone as restless as Ruyan, a demoness, wasn’t a match for Li Qiye in terms of bloodthirst and murder.</p>
 <p>Massacring and clan extermination was just an ordinary meal to Li Qiye. It was as if a day without war and blood would be a boring and lonely day.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look at me like that.” He shook his head after noticing the stares: “I’m not a murderous demon or butcher, I’m simply stating the truth. The path of an emperor will be paved with dried bones, and even after becoming one, the future will still be full of obstacles and death.”</p>
 <p>The daoist smiled in response: “Before knowing Brother Li, I might have felt some regret for not choosing the path of the heavens, but now, I think the path of the grand era is more suitable for me. With you here, there is no chance for me to become emperor.”</p>
 <p>These words were not uttered carelessly. He truly had the power and talents to reach for the throne. Even if Meng Zhentian came out, he just needed another three to five years before being able to compete all the same.</p>
 <p>“Let him in.” Li Qiye told Ruyan: “If Meng Zhentian won’t come, we can still listen to his disciple for a bit.”</p>
 <p>Ruyan followed his instruction. A bit later, Bao Yujiang and Cao Guojian were led inside by the disciples.</p>
 <p>Yujiang followed his master in. The moment he saw Li Qiye, his eyes ignited with rage. He glared at him as if this feud wouldn’t end until one of them died.</p>
 <p>Guojian politely greeted Ruyan and Jianshi. He found it a bit surprising to see Daoist Puresun as well: “So Puresun Island Lord is also here? It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about me, I’m just passing by.” The daoist smiled and left.</p>
 <p>Guojian cupped his fists before formally taking out a document. He solemnly handed it to Ruyan and Jianshi while saying: “I have been entrusted the task to visit Schoolmasters by my master.”</p>
 <p>The two took a look. This was a formal document of communication between great powers with the personal signature of Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>The three words “Meng Zhentian” were majestic and exuded a mighty aura that struck at the face; it was as if he was standing before them.</p>
 <p>Ruyan accepted the document and cheerfully asked: “What business are you here for, Lord Cao?”</p>
 <p>Guojian wanted to speak, but he refrained from doing so after seeing Li Qiye leisurely sitting there.</p>
 <p>Jianshi gracefully said: “Young Noble Li and our Void Imperfection Schools are on the same side. Lord Cao, you don’t have to watch your words.” [1. The raw would be “under the same household”, but you can see why it would be weird. This phrase works for allies/families/friends. You can see what Jianshi is implying with this.]</p>
 <p>Guojian looked at him a bit more before speaking: “Schoolmaster Liu, Schoolmaster Zhuo, my master’s emergence this time will certainly result in him becoming the Immortal Emperor. I am here to formalize an alliance between our sects in order to lead the charming spirits in Heaven Spirit to a new golden age with our immortalized contributions.”</p>
 <p>This was within the two girls’ expectations. Meng Zhentian wanted to become an emperor and actually thought about leading the charming spirits. He would be able to leave behind a great legacy in the future. This type of honor was an irresistible temptation.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the support of the Void Imperfection Schools meant that he would also garner the support of the majority of the Charming Spirit Race. Its might would wipe out some of the obstacles in his future.</p>
 <p>Jianshi smiled and slightly shook her head in response: “We appreciate Senior Meng’s high evaluation of us. However, our three schools have always been free and have no intention of competing against the world. Send him our regards.”</p>
 <p>Guojian was stunned after hearing this. He didn’t expect her to make a decision this quickly, and definitely not this frank of a refusal. He regained his wits and quickly replied: “Schoolmaster Zhuo, there’s no need to make a decision right now. My master hopes that your sect can carefully think about the alliance. You should consult the elders before making a decision.”</p>
 <p>Despite the guise of persuasion, this was also a veiled threat.</p>
 <p>“I can give you a serious response right now. Our schools have no intention of involving ourselves in this competition. I’m not just speaking on behalf of my Sacred Spring School, my words speak for all three Void Imperfection Schools.”</p>
 <p>This was not an impulsive decision or overstepping her authority. In fact, the ancestors from the three schools had already given her a clear answer, Li Qiye!</p>
 <p>In their eyes, picking a true whale rider was much better than joining hands with an Immortal Emperor. Their ancestral whale was already powerful enough, and a whale rider would be able to exert its true power. With this combination, they could sweep through the entire world.</p>
 <p>Instead of fawning over Meng Zhentian, it was better to pick Li Qiye. Moreover, they also thought that he had a great chance of becoming the Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>Spending these last few days together with Li Qiye only made Jianshi even more determined. Making Li Qiye stay with them was more important than anything else!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1334: Slap</b></p>
 <p>Jianshi’s firm attitude in her direct rejection astounded Cao Guojian. He came prepared. As long as the Void Imperfection Three Schools had any intention to form an alliance, many conditions would be negotiable.</p>
 <p>But now, Jianshi didn’t even bother discussing the conditions — this caught him completely off.</p>
 <p>Guojian tried again: “Schoolmaster Zhuo, you should take your time instead of answering right away—”</p>
 <p>Ruyan coldly interrupted him this time: “There’s no need to think twice. Sister Zhuo’s words represent my Evil Devourer School as well as the Void Imperfection Schools.”</p>
 <p>Jianshi’s refusal was one thing, but Ruyan’s words gave Guojian a hard time accepting the result.</p>
 <p>All of his preparations and calculations had been wasted. He took a deep breath and told them with great austerity: “Schoolmasters, you two should already know that when my master comes out, no one will be able to impede his path. I’m not self-praising or advertising needlessly, no one in this world is qualified for the throne outside of my master!”</p>
 <p>This tone carried great fanfare. However, it was not a shameless boast since it did contain some truth. Even in all of the nine worlds, few could compete against Meng Zhentian, at least for the next ten years.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh after hearing this. At this critical juncture, his laughter immediately changed Guojian’s expression. He already had quite a prejudice against Li Qiye, but he decided to set this enmity aside and prioritized the alliance instead.</p>
 <p>But now, this untimely laughter seemed to be aimed at their Dream Empyrean and his master, Meng Zhentian.</p>
 <p>Guojian was still quite a character. He didn’t immediately turn on Li Qiye on the spot and instead coldly asked: “May I ask why you are laughing, Young Noble Li?”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye chuckled in response: “Nothing, it was just a casual laugh, but since you have asked, I’ll answer you. Your master shouldn’t dream about the position of Immortal Emperor.”</p>
 <p>Guojian’s expression turned unsightly. Bao Yujiang, who had been posing calmly next to him, suddenly jumped up.</p>
 <p>Yujiang shouted: “Li, don’t be presumptuous! My grandmaster is invincible in the nine heavens, just these words alone justify your death without a burial!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiye didn’t bother glancing at the clamoring youth. Guojian slightly waved his sleeve to calm his disciple before lowering his tone towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble Li, I have heard of your feud with my disciple. As a senior, I won’t involve myself in this feud of the younger generation. I know that you are a great talent. If you join my master, I’m sure you will eventually become a great general. Your feud with my disciple will surely disappear as well. My master has a deep appreciation for geniuses, this is a great opportunity for you to rise…”</p>
 <p>Guojian was an eloquent man who gave off a very generous tone. This manner of conduct befitted his status.</p>
 <p>However, Li Qiye interrupted him and smiled: “Save these words for someone else. Your master alone isn’t qualified to recruit me.”</p>
 <p>“You!” Cao Guojian couldn’t endure this blatant disrespect.</p>
 <p>His master could deter the nine worlds. Who else would be emperor besides him? But today, a junior like Li Qiye provoked him to this degree, how could Guojian bear this anger?</p>
 <p>Yujiang shouted: “Ignorant fool, keep on running your mouth! Master, teach him a lesson—”</p>
 <p>“Pah!” Before he could finish, Li Qiye’s slap had already blown him away, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing!” Guojian eventually snapped with a grimace.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye faintly smiled: “He said to give me a lesson, so why do I need to be reserved any longer? As his master, is it time for you to teach me a lesson too?”</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye, halt your impudence.” Guojian was furious as he uttered: “I might not care about your troublemaking, but this doesn’t mean you can act arrogant before me!” [1. Guojian changed his tone here. His “I” shows that he thinks he is above Li Qiye. The “you” is informal/rude now too.]</p>
 <p>At this time, his eyes emitted a terrifying light. The divine sword on his back starting to ring. Even though it was still sheathed, it already exuded a horrifying sword intent!</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang climbed up from the deck and loudly shouted: “Master, avenge me, kill this little animal and flay his skin…”</p>
 <p>The cultivators outside didn’t know what was going on. To their astonishment, Bao Yujiang was suddenly blown away.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and came outside after hearing this. He leisurely replied: “Well, I haven’t exercised for a few days now. You want to fight, right? Come out then, don’t break someone else’s boat.”</p>
 <p>Bao Yujiang was frightened after seeing Li Qiye come out and staggered backward. Even though he was emboldened by his master as his backer, he was still quite scared of Li Qiye from the previous beating.</p>
 <p>“They want to fight!” The spectators weren’t sure what was going on, but they knew a big fight was about to break out.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye, that’s enough!” Guojian knew that his disciple was far from being a match for Li Qiye. He immediately stood before Yujiang and coldly said: “You might be strong, but you can’t do as you please! The Dream Empyrean’s disciples aren’t so easily bullied!”</p>
 <p>While hiding behind his master, Yujiang grew bolder and exclaimed: “That’s right! Li, you are nothing yet you still dare to talk about competing against my grandmaster? You aren’t even worthy of carrying his shoes, he could crush you with one finger!”</p>
 <p>He was still indignant about the previous beating and wanted to kill Li Qiye for revenge, but he knew that he was not a match. He wanted to egg his master into killing Li Qiye. This was the only way for him to wash away the humiliation from before.</p>
 <p>Cao Guojian frowned after hearing him. He came for the alliance, but his disciple’s words intensified the atmosphere. However, he wouldn’t scold his disciple in public.</p>
 <p>His disciple had been bullied by someone, so if he were to scold him right now, others would think that their Dream Empyrean consisted of pushovers.</p>
 <p>“Oh? I actually want to see just how powerful Meng Zhentian is. As the saying goes, kill the young and the old will come out, right?” Having said that with a grin, Li Qiye’s figure suddenly flashed and went straight for Yujiang.</p>
 <p>Guojian was surprised to see this attack. His divine sword left its scabbard in order to stop Li Qiye.</p>
 <p>“Lord Cao, if you want to fight, I’ll entertain you for a bit!” Jianshi’s sword swung straight for Guojian in response.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The two swords collided, causing sparks to fly everywhere. Their brilliance assaulted the sky.</p>
 <p>Guojian’s expression showed that he was now serious. His blood energy erupted alongside the murderous aura of a Godking. His sword dao instantly expanded and wanted to trap Li Qiye and stop Jianshi’s attack.</p>
 <p>However, Jianshi showed no weakness. With a buzz, her physique appeared with its dazzling light, the Sacred Spring Physique!</p>
 <p>In this split second, her blood energy surged like a storm. It became several hundred times or even thousands of times stronger while empowering her next destructive slash.</p>
 <p>Her attack instantly reached its limit like a group of stars exploding. It created an absolute sword domain that came down on Guojian’s sword dao.</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The two swords suppressed each other to a standstill. In the past, Guojian’s sword dao had the advantage, but it couldn’t advance under Jianshi’s absolute sword domain.</p>
 <p>In terms of cultivation, Jianshi was indeed not a match for Guojian who was a Grand Godking. However, she had a half-completion Immortal Physique.</p>
 <p>Once her Sacred Spring Physique activated, she would have boundless blood energy, allowing her power to soar wildly.</p>
 <p>Even the most ordinary move would become the most domineering and vicious attack due to her endless blood energy.</p>
 <p>This Sacred Spring Physique could boost one’s blood energy to undepletable amounts and last forever. This meant that a cultivator with this physique might not be the most powerful on the battlefield, but they would definitely be the most resilient!</p>

</div><div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><b>Chapter 1335: True Power</b></p>
 <p>While Jianshi’s absolute sword domain confronted Guojian’s sword dao, Li Qiye had already swept Yujiang off his feet and held him by the throat.</p>
 <p>Yujiang’s eyes turned white as he gasped for air. Li Qiye maintained his grip and chuckled: “If an ant continues to crawl beneath my feet, wanting to bite, I won’t mind stomping it to death.”</p>
 <p>“Ma-master, save me!” When death was this close, Yujiang finally felt fear as he turned pale and begged his master for help.</p>
 <p>“Li Qiye, do you really want to become enemies with our Dream Empyrean?” Guojian was alarmed as well. Even though he was a Grand Godking, he couldn’t quickly defeat Jianshi. Moreover, she herself had an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure!</p>
 <p>He had no choice but to shout and reveal his backing when his disciple’s life was hanging by a thread: “Li Qiye, rethink things over! If you kill my disciple today, you will become our enemy! At that point, there will be no place for you left in this world!”</p>
 <p>Guojian’s threat was blatant, but it wasn’t just an arrogant rhetoric. Many cultivators shuddered after hearing this, including paragons from the previous generation.</p>
 <p>Killing Meng Zhentian’s granddisciple in front of this many people was something unforgivable. Meng Zhentian’s power was as clear as day. If he actually became the Immortal Emperor, one could easily imagine the consequences of being his enemy. Just as Guojian has said, the world might be vast, but there will be no place for them to hide!</p>
 <p>Thus, one needed to weigh their own ability after hearing such a threat. However, this didn’t seem to apply to Li Qiye who only smiled in response.</p>
 <p>Ruyan also chuckled and emotionlessly said: “Lord Cao, is this your personal opinion, or are you representing your master’s will?”</p>
 <p>“I’m speaking on behalf of my master!” He immediately replied: “Li Qiye, if you seek self-preservation, let go of my disciple right now or face the consequences!”</p>
 <p>He was afraid of breaking the vase while trying to kill the mouse. He couldn’t kill Jianshi in a short period of time and knew that even if he tried to save Yujiang, it would only be pushing him further towards death. Thus, he had to borrow his master’s prestige to intimidate Li Qiye into sparing his disciple.</p>
 <p>This was met with a carefree smile from Li Qiye: “I actually want to see Meng Zhentian’s will and if it can save his granddisciple or not.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, he clenched his fingers. A cracking sound resounded along with Yujiang’s scream. His soul almost left his body from fright as he yelled: “Master, save me!”</p>
 <p>Provoking Meng Zhentian this blatantly left everyone stunned silly.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Behold my master’s decree!” Having said that, Guojian unrolled a scroll.</p>
 <p>The word “pardon” was written on it. The character was written in a majestic manner; every stroke contained the rhythm of the dao. It also contained the invincible will of Meng Zhentian since it was handwritten by him.</p>
 <p>Someone at his invincible level could impart their will into their writing that would then cause others to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>Many people’s knees uncontrollably shook after seeing this word.</p>
 <p>It had yet to come down, but its divine aura alone was already enough to instill fear into their souls. One could extrapolate just how powerful Meng Zhentian was from this decree.</p>
 <p>Everyone held their breaths after Guojian took out the scroll. The atmosphere instantly became oppressive.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just a decree that represented an invincible will. Keep in mind that Meng Zhentian was still alive and would become the Immortal Emperor. This meant that anyone who chose not to give him any consideration would be opposing him — an unforgivable feud. No matter who they might be, they must think twice before making this decision.</p>
 <p>The dignified atmosphere made someone as great as Cao Guojian feel a bit smug. After all, his master’s prestige could still threaten the world like before. This will, his master’s glory was simply unstoppable, so of course he was proud and arrogant.</p>
 <p>He had quite a momentum going as he declared: “Schoolmasters, this is my master’s inviolable will! If you wish to oppose my Dream Empyrean and my master, then invite your own masters first. This relates to your schools’ future, an existential crisis!”</p>
 <p>At this time, the two sides were about to abandon all pretenses. Earlier, Guojian was still quite polite, but he was now furious after the quick exchange. Their Dream Empyrean was on the rise while his master was the sun at noon. Why should he tolerate such disrespect from the Void Imperfection Schools?</p>
 <p>“What’s so great about Meng Zhentian’s decree?” Jianshi was much more graceful, but the demoness Ruyan didn’t share this personality.</p>
 <p>She became irate towards Guojian’s threats: “Not to mention that he has yet to become emperor, even if he was one, his will does not represent everything! A decree, right? Very well, take a look at my Evil Devourer School’s will!”</p>
 <p>Having said that, a scroll appeared in her hand. With a loud blast, four words showed up — “World, be exonerated!” They flowed as smooth as dancing dragons and phoenixes. Even though the style was refined and graceful, they had an aura capable of assaulting myriad ages.</p>
 <p>It was an ancient scroll, yet its momentum didn’t wither in the slightest. Ruyan was already an unrestrained individual, so in her rage, she directed the decree straight at Cao Guojian.</p>
 <p>This exoneration decree suppressed the entire region. An ethereal beauty capable of devouring the world seemed to be standing there among the characters.</p>
 <p>A paragon who knew what it was shouted: “The decree of the Evil Devourer progenitor!”</p>
 <p>Guojian didn’t think that Ruyan would immediately fight after a little argument without leaving any room for deliberation. He was shocked and had no choice but to also unleash the decree in his hand against the divine prestige of a grand completion Immortal Physique user.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” The word “pardon” pierced the sun and flew across the world. A figure emerged within, stealing the brilliance of the celestials as it looked down on all existences!</p>
 <p>“Meng Zhentian’s will!” Everyone knew who this figure was right away.</p>
 <p>It represented his unstoppable will. Not only was he powerful, he was still alive. This meant that his will would be even stronger. It made everyone think that the real deal was standing before them.</p>
 <p>Weaker cultivators couldn’t stand straight and had to kneel on the ground as they were unable to handle his pressure.</p>
 <p>“Yet to be emperor but already acting like one!” Ruyan sneered. She fearlessly unleashed all the power in her scroll.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” This decree seemingly vanished, giving room for a terrifying black hole to appear. The ethereal figure standing in the black hole had her hair fluttering in the wind. She looked around and was ready to devour gods and devils!</p>
 <p>This was the will of the Evil Devourer progenitor. Even though she didn’t become an Immortal Emperor, she was an Immortal Physique user that could assail one!</p>
 <p>With her will crashing down, Meng Zhentian’s figure also erupted and grew incomparably tall. He could seize the stars as well as the entire world in his palm. It was as if his stomp could flatten all things. However, this will couldn’t hold up against the physique user.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Under the constant suppression of the progenitor, Zhentian’s mighty figure suddenly dimmed. His sky-wearing body slowly shrunk.</p>
 <p>A big shot murmured to himself: “This is a real grand completion master at the summit. Even if she didn’t have this physique, her cultivation back then must have been stronger than Meng Zhentian. This is a real existence capable of hurting an emperor!”</p>
 <p>Both were decrees, but Meng Zhentian’s was inferior compared to the Evil Devourer progenitor’s. Despite the fact that he was still alive, his decree couldn’t resist her will.</p>
 <p>After all, it was exactly what that cultivator said earlier, she was a true existence at the Emperor Assailant level. Her cultivation on top of her grand completion Immortal Physique granted her unfathomable might!</p>

 <p><b>Chapter 1336: Merciless Slaughter</b></p>
 <p>“Rumble!” Meng Zhentian’s gigantic figure was being pressed down and became smaller and smaller. The word “Pardon” was fading away because of Ruyan’s decree.</p>
 <p>Guojian’s expression turned ugly after seeing this. However, he was riding a tiger and couldn’t get off. He cried out and summoned a treasure. Under the strengthening of his blood energy, it emitted a powerful battle intent that fused with Meng Zhentian’s will, causing it to become much stronger. It was now able to withstand the suppression.</p>
 <p>This was a treasure personally created by Zhentian. It contained both his powerful merit laws and battle intent.</p>
 <p>“Meng Zhentian really is strong.” Many people were trembling after seeing this.</p>
 <p>Although it might look like a fight between Ruyan and Guojian, it was a confrontation through time between the Evil Devourer progenitor and Meng Zhentian. Of course, the progenitor won the first exchange even though she was no longer in this world.</p>
 <p>However, Zhentian had a treasure combined with his will. This allowed his shadow to stabilize the situation and withstand the pressure.</p>
 <p>Jianshi elegantly asked in the back: “Lord Cao, you wish to test our arsenal?”</p>
 <p>“Clank!” A sword appeared in her hand. In the blink of an eye, an Immortal Emperor’s aura went on a rampage as if an emperor had personally arrived.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Meng Zhentian’s figure couldn’t withstand this development and collapsed right away. The decree in Cao Guojian’s hand suddenly turned into ashes while he staggered backward. His blood energy was churning from the suppression now placed on him.</p>
 <p>Jianshi’s sword was an imperial weapon left behind by Immortal Emperor Wu Gou. The result had been determined the moment it came out. Meng Zhentian’s will was no match for an Immortal Emperor’s!</p>
 <p>In this brief moment, the scene went silent. Guojian was livid. Jianshi was right, they were comparing their arsenals!</p>
 <p>“Your sect’s resources are still too weak.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Meng Zhentian himself might be able to do something, but you are only a fox borrowing the might of a tiger by coming here like this. Go back and tell Meng Zhentian that it doesn’t matter how strong he thinks he is, he better start acting smart or else during the imperial preselection, I will take off his head and hang it in the highest location in Heaven Spirit!”</p>
 <p>With that, he twisted Bao Yujiang’s neck. The boy didn’t have time to scream. His eyes were wide open in astonishment since he didn’t expect Li Qiye to dare kill him in front of his master.</p>
 <p>“You!” Guojian’s anger was unrestrainable. He wildly howled and wanted to rush forward, but Jianshi and Ruyan blocked his path.</p>
 <p>One person had the decree of the Evil Devourer School while the other had an imperial sword. They activated their half completion Immortal Physiques as well — the Evil Devourer Physique and the Sacred Spring Physique.</p>
 <p>It was easy to imagine their battle prowess when they had these artifacts with them.</p>
 <p>Jianshi slowly said: “Lord Cao, we have heard of your prestige as a Grand Godking for a long time now. If you want to fight, we’ll entertain you!”</p>
 <p>Ruyan was even more domineering. She grinned and said: “Lord Cao, I’m not intentionally belittling you, but even with your great cultivation, you are no match for us without an imperial weapon and only something given to you by your master.”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere became serious and tense to the extreme. It was unfortunate that someone as strong as Cao Guojian had to face Ruyan and Jianshi.</p>
 <p>The two sisters were already quite mighty and had stepped into the path of the grand era. Moreover, they also had their physiques to back up their cultivations.</p>
 <p>In the contemporary, they weren’t necessarily weaker than the Seashield Prince, the Swiftdao God, or the Seven Sea Goddess at all! It was that they preferred to keep a low profile.</p>
 <p>Guojian didn’t have an imperial weapon, so he didn’t have an absolute advantage over the sisters. At this time, it was clear to see which sect had more resources. Even though the Dream Empyrean’s progenitor was quite mighty, the sect itself never had an Immortal Emperor.</p>
 <p>Li Qiye smiled and threw Yujiang’s head to Guojian while flatly declaring: “This is my warning! In this generation, no one but me is qualified to be called emperor!</p>
 <p>With that, he ignored Guojian and went back inside the boat.</p>
 <p>Guojian was trembling from anger. He initially came for an alliance, but it ended in a feud with the Void Imperfection Schools on top of his disciple’s death. In fact, this could have been avoided if it wasn’t for Bao Yujiang’s remark. Alas, there was nothing he could do since the wheels had been set in motion. He had no choice but to fight at that moment.</p>
 <p>Everyone was holding their breaths. The scene of Li Qiye challenging Meng Zhentian was too shocking. Zhentian was currently untouchable, yet Li Qiye had no qualms at all with his domineering and arrogant style.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Jianshi spoke in a serious tone: “Lord Cao, please return.”</p>
 <p>Guojian gritted his teeth and said: “Schoolmaster Zhuo, you will regret your choice one day! The destruction of the Void Imperfection Schools will be because of this!”</p>
 <p>“Lord Cao, thank you for worrying about our schools.” Ruyan chuckled: “Our choice is our own business. Moreover, you should wait until your master actually becomes an Immortal Emperor before talking about destroying us because with his current status, we can still easily suppress him!”</p>
 <p>This was a grand declaration! It showed the true power and hidden aces of the Void Imperfection Schools! Many people suddenly realized something! Perhaps the schools still had existences capable of assailing Immortal Emperors right now!</p>
 <p>It would be too shocking if this was true. Assailing emperors was a very serious topic! If they still had this type of existence, their schools would be completely unfathomable.</p>
 <p>Guojian angrily stomped before leaving, not wanting to stay any longer. He would repay this humiliation one day, but his experienced self told him to endure for now.</p>
 <p>The crowd was contemplating what had just transpired in silence while checking each other’s expressions.</p>
 <p>Someone murmured: “Fierce is domineering and ferocious enough. Cao Guojian won’t be the only one angry, I’m afraid Meng Zhentian won’t swallow this very easily.”</p>
 <p>An older character wondered: “Is this the prelude to the contest for the throne?”</p>
 <p>An older paragon from the previous generation explained: “If Li Qiye wants to be emperor, he had to take this step. Meng Zhentian’s appearance meant that he would become the greatest rival to all the young geniuses who want to be emperor. It was just a matter of time before someone came out to challenge him. Since Zhentian has experienced the last competition, he has an advantage over the other geniuses. Nevertheless, Li Qiye is the first challenger.”</p>
 <p>The knowledgeable people knew just how cruel the path towards emperor was. Countless geniuses had been buried, their bones paved the way for the next ruler! Meng Zhentian was an unavoidable mountain for all those who want to become emperor. However, no one expected Li Qiye to be the first challenger, and this soon at that.</p>
 <p>Someone couldn’t help but speculate: “What is Li Qiye relying on in order to compete? Will the Peacock Tree be his dao protector, or perhaps an invincible ancestor from the Void Imperfection Schools?”</p>
 <p>In their minds, Li Qiye was very powerful, but he still wasn’t a match for Meng Zhentian. He was too young; his cultivation wasn’t at that level just yet.</p>
 <p>Given the circumstances, this meant that Li Qiye had people strong enough to protect him. Otherwise, he would be killed before being able to do anything.</p>
 <p>The daoist commented with emotion after Li Qiye came back: “Your domineering style is something I won’t ever be able to learn.”</p>
 <p>“If you had chosen the path of the heavens, you would have a chance as well.” Li Qiye glanced at the daoist and smiled.</p>
 <p>The daoist shook his head in response with a wry smile: “No, I am glad to have picked the path of the grand era. My talents might allow me to compete with others, but after meeting you, I learned that I would have only become dried bones that pave your path towards invincibility. And I’m sure your path will have more than enough bones, so there’s no need to add mine to the pile.”</p>
 <p>He spoke with great confidence while revealing the current balance of the competition!</p>

A few big characters from the previous generation couldn’t help but lick their lips. Everyone knew that the bigger ships were safer. Of course, the first condition was to take down all the skeletons.</span></p>

However, the creatures were stronger on bigger ships. If one wasn’t strong enough, it would be a foolish endeavor to board. Thus, as this huge ship approached, people only kept on watching.</span></p>

Sure enough, the skeletons didn’t move at all; it was as if they didn’t notice the intruders’ presence. The crowd felt quite envious after seeing the successful boarding. However, it stopped at envy since they didn’t dare to follow them.</span></p>

It looked like a giant bird. Even though countless years had passed and its bones had been charred, its divinity was still flashing on the broken fragments.</span></p>

It is a priceless and invincible creature, after all.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “It is already remarkable enough to have some of a phoenix’s bloodline.”</span></p>

Are there any differences between the skeletons here and the ones at the Bonesea? Why are they on these ships that follow this pattern of going back and forth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled at this question: “This is a key question. Your four branches, starting from Immortal Emperor Gu Chun all the way to Immortal Emperor Yan Shi, could be considered the lineage who has explored the Bonesea the most. You might not know about this, but they certainly were aware of many things.”</span></p>

In a certain sense, these skeletons on the ships want to flee from the Bonesea. Alas, it is but a pipedream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They want to escape?” The group was astounded after hearing this. Xiong Qianbei had to ask: “But they’re already dead. Is it out of a desire to return to their home to be buried there?”</span></p>

To be able to get up from the bottom of the sea and onto this ship means that they were extremely powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where did these skeletons come from then?” The daoist’s heart skipped a beat as he thought about some old records from his sect.</span></p>

Because of that, you can see this scene right now — these boneships drifting in the Bonesea. Some just travel aimlessly while others might make it to the edge, but in the end, escape is not their fate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi asked: “Not even one can escape?”</span></p>

The formation of the Bonesea had always been an unsolved mystery.</span></p>

She didn’t only look at the skeletons but also tilted her head in contemplation. Her beautiful eyes became incomparably bright and enchanting. However, this flash only lasted for a moment before her pupils became dazed again. She thought quite hard, but nothing came of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you remember anything?” Li Qiye gently patted her hair as she stood there in a solitary daze.</span></p>

It wasn’t good to tell her before the time was ripe, so he softly said: “There is always pain and parting in this world. Countless calamities have fallen, and experiencing too much can torture the heart. When you understand why things come and go, you will be able to understand everything.”</span></p>

It would require many steps as well as certain necessary items.”</span></p>

He was surrounded by one layer of foes after another, but their mad onslaught couldn’t wound him.</span></p>

Don’t fall down or even I can’t save you.”</span></p>

Li Qiye activated his World Seal and turned into the Yin Yang Immortal Refining Mirror. Two rays that consisted of Yin and Yang rushed out and struck the area next to the daoist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the might of the bright Yin and Yang, bones began to crack. All the skeletons were blown into the sea, even the daoist was knocked away.</span></p>

He rushed back against the current as the mirror’s light pierced his body. His body was cracking apart as pieces of flesh flew with the wind. Without a doubt, this light was able to harm him.</span></p>

The daoist heaved a sigh of relief after making contact with the deck once more. He revealed a forced smile and said: “Brother Li, you almost killed me there with that move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye glanced at him and replied: “Just that can kill you? You have the Ancient Purity Blade; if you can’t even survive that, I would be very disappointed. Unless those old geezers are crazy, they wouldn’t have let you run around with it if you weren’t strong enough.”</span></p>

She tilted her head and curiously asked: “Is your body very tough?”</span></p>

He wasn’t one to brag, but he ended up saying: “It’s not bad, I can handle one or two cuts!”</span></p>

Even though Fairy’s beauty was matchless, no matter how he looked at it, she was only a delicate girl who couldn’t even catch a chicken. Moreover, those innocent eyes were completely harmless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She reached out with her finger and pointed it at the daoist’s shoulder.</span></p>

He was completely aghast the moment he saw her finger touch him.</span></p>

Even an attack from a God-Monarch couldn’t hurt him, let alone a weak girl like Fairy, so he calmly accepted this “attack”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” With a loud blast, he was instantly blown away. Blood spattered everywhere as a horrifying hole appeared where his shoulder should be.</span></p>

With the cultivation of a Godking on top of his diamond physique, he should have been unbeatable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the weak touch of Fairy immediately pierced his shoulder. His physique couldn’t withstand this blow, so he was blown away into the sea.</span></p>

Otherwise, he would have fallen in there for good.</span></p>

Not to mention Xiong Qianbei, even the two girls were astounded with their eyes wide open.&nbsp;</span></p>

They would have to resort to their extraordinary Immortal Physique Strikes.</span></p>

Just how horrifying was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daoist forgot to say thanks to Li Qiye for saving him. He stared at Fairy as if she was a ghost. The experience just now was too much for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t one for loud fanfares, but he had great confidence in his abilities. For example, Meng Zhentian. This was someone famed for being powerful, but this type of existence still wouldn’t be able to break his physique this casually with one finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Meng Zhentian could carry out such a feat, he wouldn’t be Meng Zhentian but a real Immortal Emperor!</span></p>

Is this an Immortal Emperor?” Even his elegant self resorted to vulgarity at this moment while staring at Fairy in fear.</span></p>

As for Xiong Qianbei, his butt was already on the ground.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone else were to say this, Puresun would think that they were mocking him. However, her serious expression and pure eyes made it clear that she wasn’t being rude on purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others weren’t qualified to mock someone as strong as him, but he didn’t feel angry when it came from Fairy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m really weak indeed.” He wryly smiled while bandaging his wound. He had no choice but to face his own weakness at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and said: “Losing to her is nothing to be ashamed of. If she truly becomes angry, only a handful of people in the nine heavens and ten earths could survive ten moves from her. Even if the old men crawl out from their graves, they still won’t be able to do much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daoist had nothing to say about this defeat. There wasn’t much to think about when she could break his physique with a single finger. The two girls carefully observed Fairy once more. From her appearance alone, she didn’t look like an invincible existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her attack from earlier proved otherwise. She was truly invincible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, on the deck, Qianbei swallowed his saliva. He felt a bit thirsty and didn’t know whether he should feel regretful or scared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With respect to regret, it was because he sold such an invincible fairy for the price of a cabbage, relatively speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for fear, he actually carried the wooden coffin in secrecy for so long. Moreover, he slammed it more than just once or twice. If during this process, Fairy were to come out and found him annoying, he would be rendered to dust in just one strike — a death without a burial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of such terrible consequences made him break out in cold sweat. He had narrowly and unwittingly avoided a disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is everyone this weak now?” Perplexed, she asked Li Qiye while looking at him with a hint of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were speechless. Most of the groups here could travel through the world proudly, especially the daoist who was stronger than Ruyan and Jianshi. However, Fairy made it sound like they wouldn’t be able to withstand a single strike, as if they were as insignificant as ants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the daoist had no desire of refuting her. Fairy was indeed qualified to call him weak after the earlier event. Xiong Qianbei, on the other hand, was indeed a minor character. If the daoist’s group was weak, then someone like him wasn’t qualified to even be an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled wryly after hearing this. He gently stroked her hair and said: “Times are different. Some people will have to face a few things in the end. Across the eras, many invincible existences have died, so the inhabitants of all races are no longer flourishing at the apex. What we have now is reasonable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fairy contemplated this answer.</span></p>

However, this isn’t a good thing at all. When that day comes, the calamity will come once more. Wane comes after the zenith, this is an inescapable natural order.”</span></p>

They couldn’t understand many things he spoke of. Fairy kept on thinking with her eyes flashing brightly. Ultimately, she became confused again since these short bursts of elucidation weren’t enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and returned to the rudder. His hands lit up with narrow runes that formed a stream of light. They slowly flowed like time itself and seemingly had their own life. These runes wrapped around the shudder and drilled inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ship’s speed increased while giving off a difficult-to-describe sensation.

The common belief was that these ships couldn’t be controlled. Those who board could only let the ships drift wherever they wanted; of course, they also had the option to switch ships during the journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled in response: “That depends on the person. If you understand the mysteries and fundamental essences of the Bonesea, then you can remove its restrictions and control the ship regardless of one’s strength. Of course, the stronger you are, the stronger the ship will be after the takeover. It is quite a big mystery within the grand scheme of things.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, the entire ship lit up.

They were quite delicate and exquisite, making the entire ship look like a carved masterpiece. Upon closer inspection, one would find that these runes were quite complex. There was vegetation as well as rare beasts. They carried a natural and vast aura of antiquity. It seemed that something was recorded in these patterns.</span></p>

Outside of surviving and looking at other sentient beings, I have never explored other matters as I have missed the best era. In such an era, I failed to pursue the true meaning at the end of the world.”</span></p>

In your heart are other living beings, compassion, and mercy — all of this changed the era itself. I am different from you. You have too many worries and things you care about in your heart while I only think of myself and the answer, nothing else. Thus, on this path, other existences are only fleeting passersby. I show no mercy to anyone or anything that tries to block my path, and I will never stop for any reason. If I am ruthless incarnate, then you are the embodiment of compassion.”</span></p>

Runes in the shape of gears of different colors emerged near the rudder. It looked like each gear was made out of bronze. Their appearance issued a cranking mechanical sound. Li Qiye was glad to see these runes and immediately moved the rudder. Under his influence, the gears shifted and the ship began to move towards his desired destination.</span></p>

The boneship was now traveling at an unbelievable velocity through the winds and waves. It was actually jumping in the air above the water due to Li Qiye’s control. Their ship quickly passed by many other boneships, leaving them in the dust.</span></p>

Along the way, there was a boneship with a single passenger going back. This was indeed quite rare. Right now, the reason why everyone was rushing towards the Bonesea was because of the object of immortality. The feast was just beginning, so who would be willing to leave this early?</span></p>

Looking forward, they seemed to be heading towards the sky vault. This area was simply too empty. There was no end in sight, making it seem as if this place was unimaginably vast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Li Qiye’s ship, all the other ones lost their weight as well. In this particular state, everything floated upward with the bow on top.</span></p>

They looked like meteors with their screams echoing across the entire area before disappearing into the dark expanse.</span></p>

They subconsciously held onto the ships even tighter to avoid falling off.</span></p>

He grabbed onto the deck as well since he felt that the rope alone was not safe enough.</span></p>

It is up to your own fortune whether you can obtain anything or not.”</span></p>

Eventually, they made it to the end. Many cultivators looked curiously around with greed in their eyes…</span></p>

A seemingly endless amount was scattered in this void.</span></p>

They came from imperial lineages and were no strangers to treasures, but this was their first time seeing so many floating around in the void like this. There were all kinds of them, not limited to just weapons and jewels. Some were simply indescribable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far from Li Qiye’s ship was a large palace made out of gold. It was lit up in flames as if it was the palace of a sun god. Its gates were shut tight, so who knows what treasures lie beyond them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that over there?” Jianshi pointed at a spectacle in the distance. There was an active volcano in this void, spewing out bubbling magma. However, this magma was actually a golden liquid.</span></p>

They consisted of seals, bright jewels, disks, and mysterious vessels. However, after gushing upward, they would fall back into the volcanic crater.</span></p>

One started drooling and had to lick his lips: “If you obtain this volcano, you could feed an entire great power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled while looking at this volcano: “In the distant past, there was a divine beast who devoured treasures from all over the world. The more it swallowed, the more powerful it became.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi immediately inquired: “This volcano is a divine beast?”</span></p>

The most precious part of its body should be its stomach. Even though it has died with nothing left, its stomach was too precious and was able to be preserved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because all the treasures are stored there.” Jianshi understood what happened. This gigantic volcano-shaped stomach contained numerous treasures.</span></p>

After a while, a treasure floated by Li Qiye’s group. It was a wooden chest that made strange vibration noises, as if there was something alive inside that was occasionally shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan heard a phoenix cry from the chest and asked: “Is something alive in there? A phoenix, maybe?”</span></p>

The treasure inside doesn’t matter, the chest itself is the important part. The phoenix hymn you are hearing and why it is shaking has nothing to do with the treasure inside. It is the wooden chest itself.” Li Qiye shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan asked: “What kind of treasure is it?”</span></p>

Rumor has it that in the ancient times, if one used Immortal Phoenix Wood to make a chest, it could change rotten items into magical items, a common pheasant into a phoenix.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A pheasant into a phoenix? Really?” Daoist Puresun’s eyes lit up.</span></p>

I haven’t tried it. If you can get it, then you can give it a shot.”</span></p>

It was a long rope that aimed for the chest at lightning speed in order to pull it back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when it almost wrapped around the chest, it failed to make contact. The rope fell into the dark expanse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Interesting.” The daoist turned serious. He stretched out one hand that had a golden glow; it was empowered by his Immortal Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of bones breaking immediately came when he almost touched the chest. He was aghast and withdrew his hand with his fastest speed. He saw his arm bloodied and completely broken, a truly horrifying scene. The girls took deep breaths after seeing this. Even under the power of the diamond physique, his arm was still shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the other cultivators saw a few treasures drifting by and became tempted just like the daoist. They quickly took action, resulting in screams. All the ones who tried to grab the items failed. The good cases ended with grievous injuries while those who were worse off ended in their deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of them still didn’t give up. They tied their bodies to the ships with rope and flew out in order to reach some treasures.</span></p>

These cultivators and their ships fell into the darkness along with all the other passengers.</span></p>

It looks like the one on your back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daoist looked over and found a sword floating in a faraway corner of the void. It looked exactly like the one he was carrying. The only difference was that his sword looked much older while the floating one still emitted a dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He subconsciously touched his Ancient Purity Blade and wondered if that was an identical blade.</span></p>

He would never believe that there was an identical sword to his own if he didn’t see it with his own eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your sword is quite good. Of course, that one over there isn’t bad either.” Li Qiye looked at the sword and smiled at him.</span></p>

Even though it was said to be his ancestor’s true treasure, they, as the younger generation, didn’t know whether it was created by him or if it had some other origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiong Qianbei suddenly shouted and pointed far ahead: “What about that?”</span></p>

It seemed to be a terrifying black hole capable of devouring all light. Not a single glimmer of light could escape from its maw.</span></p>

Onlookers would be confused by this scene from not knowing whether if it was the skull that gave birth to the black hole or vice versa. Perhaps it was the skull that was absorbing all the light instead. People couldn’t distinguish the fundamental cause of this phenomenon.</span></p>

It was too bizarre for description. In short, its particular awkwardness was not in tune with the common perception of skulls. Because of this, the spectators became instinctively uncomfortable; it was as if the eye sockets were peering into their inner darkness. As one gazed longer at this black hole, they would eventually notice the skull even though it blended in so well.</span></p>

Only truly powerful cultivators could detect this anomaly. The power of this space seemed to be suppressed.

In this place, even Godkings would tread carefully without taking any risks lest they die. As for forcefully seizing a fortune, it was something they didn’t dare to even think about. But today, a junior like Li Qiye has done just that. This was incomparably domineering and unexpected.</span></p>

In a certain sense, the crystal physique is more of a trick while the diamond physique is true physical prowess! The latter is eternal. As long as you are alive, your physique will continue to be there. It will protect you for a lifetime while the crystal physique has a time limit. In the beginning, the crystal physique is truly enviable with great advantages because it can evade many powerful enemies. However, it can’t compare to the diamond physique at grand completion.”</span></p>

Even if you lose, the emperor would find it exceedingly difficult to kill you. An ordinary emperor might not even be capable of doing so. Will you still envy the crystal physique then?”</span></p>

Not far from where they were, a group of eight eyes could be seen. They were large like the eyes of bulls. The eight eyes made strange noises before floating towards the group.</span></p>

All eight blinked at the same time and tumbled down onto Xiong Qianbei’s hand.</span></p>

He didn’t expect to obtain this fortune when the others were much more excellent. He thought that if it wasn’t Li Qiye, it would be the daoist or someone else instead.</span></p>

This was an era with ferocious beasts everywhere, but this type of bull was a king among kings; they were extremely fierce and powerful. They have eight eyes, each with a different ability. Even though this particular one died here, its eight eyes have survived. Thus, you can just imagine how powerful it was during the ancient time.”</span></p>

Even though this bloodline is very thin at your generation, it still flows through you nevertheless.”</span></p>

Many cultivators on the other ships were envious of him. Alas, fortune always went to others instead of themselves.</span></p>

There were more than just weapons and artifacts left behind by people of the past. The most precious parts of the bodies of some creatures were preserved till this day.</span></p>

The Bonesea has many amazing things. I can take everyone there, but it will be up to you to get the treasures.”</span></p>

Their treasury was something outsiders could never even begin to fathom, so for the daoist, experience was more important than treasures.</span></p>

In fact, Jianshi was staring at him with her clear eyes as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They came with great hope because he previously said that their Windchase Break was located at the Bonesea.

Even if it isn’t meant to be, I will forcefully seize it! Yes, you two sisters have served me quite well in the recent days, so I can’t mistreat your school.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi blushed from this teasing while Ruyan smiled without any bashfulness at all: “If you stay at our schools, we will treat you like a living god.”</span></p>

That doesn’t sound bad, but I was born a poor man and unaccustomed to the lavish lifestyle. I should stick to my poverty-stricken ways instead.”</span></p>

Jianshi, on the other hand, only sighed in her mind. She knew that her school couldn’t keep someone as great as Li Qiye, a true dragon that will soar in the sky. How could a small pond like theirs contain such a beast?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a good while, Li Qiye looked at the sky and said: “Get ready, we’re about to arrive at the watery area. Hold your breath or you will look quite ugly from choking.” The group held their breaths after hearing this.</span></p>

The boneships struck the surface right away and began to float. This process was too fast. It wasn’t a process of floating up from the bottom of the sea, it was entering from another world.</span></p>

Because of these piles, this sea seemed to be divided. It was difficult to see the whole ocean due to these bony protrusions. The visible water looked like narrow rivers, allowing the little ships to pass through the ghastly hills.</span></p>

The more timid crowd would forever be stained with this shadow for the rest of their life. Stray bones were also floating among the cold splashing waves. The majority of the skeletons here remained relatively intact, making it seem as if something had eaten the flesh while leaving the bones behind.</span></p>

Their varied shapes exceeded one’s imagination. Some were unreasonably large while others were wonderfully small. Looking around, one would see a small pheasant-like skeleton next to a mountain-sized skeleton. The large ones came in a variety as well. There was an elephant head with its ivory tusks stretched out for dozens of miles, and another looked just like a dragon. This might be an ancient python; it spanned for several thousand miles just like a mountain range. One could easily imagine just how large and mighty it used to be when it was alive.</span></p>

A single glance wasn’t sufficient to discern the creature. However, upon closer inspection, one would find that this sky-piercing peak was only part of a finger, so just how large was the hand below the sea?</span></p>

Jianshi quietly asked: “Is she an Immortal Emperor?”</span></p>

If there was an empress present, there would be no chance for everyone to be unaware of her presence. Moreover, this was a new generation with an upcoming Heaven’s Will, so how could there already be an empress?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at her and flatly stated: “No, she’s something even greater.”</span></p>

No one else in this world would say such a thing outside of Li Qiye in this specific circumstance. Moreover, the existence mentioned should not exist! How could there be something greater than an Immortal Emperor?!</span></p>

Back then, Immortal Emperor Yan Shi made a very famous statement, commenting on the differences. I’m sure your four branches have recorded this.”</span></p>

In her words, if there are nine levels to Immortal Emperor, I would place her at the eighth. Of course, this was a matter to be discussed later on.”</span></p>

I’ll take everyone somewhere where there is a real treasury, but just like before, whether you can get anything or not will depend on your own fortune.” Having said that, he maneuvered the ship towards a particular direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They swiftly traveled through countless bone mountains on this sea. In the beginning, the group thought that there was nothing except bones, but they soon found out that this was a misconception.</span></p>

These things aren’t that strong, but once we go deeper into that place, it will be a fight with your lives on the line.”</span></p>

A giant eagle approached them from overhead. To be exact, it was the skeleton of a giant eagle. It spread its ten-meter-long wings and came out of nowhere only to dive towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its beak was immensely sharp and its hook-like claws were equally deadly. One could hear the wind howl as it dived down with a momentum capable of tearing this ship into little pieces.</span></p>

His quick-draw was impeccable. Others could only see a flashing glint followed by a clank that came from the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With one slash, the giant bird was split into halves and fell into the sea. His Ancient Purity Blade had already returned to its scabbard. No one actually had a chance to see it clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the unsheathing to the sheathing motions, it was a continuous and flawless flow. This was indicative of his wondrous mastery. Soon after dealing with the bird, the water down below began to splash all over the place. Countless skeletal monkeys sprang up onto the ship. They squeaked and screamed before lunging at the group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come!” Ruyan chuckled and activated her Evil Devourer Physique. A black hole appeared right away and started to grind away at the bones. Virtually all of these skeletal monkeys were rendered into dust in an instant.</span></p>

However, a few of them remain unyielding and turned into skeletons on these ships in order to escape from the Bonesea. There is another group that have been morphed into evil spirits by the death energy here. They consider this sea to be their home and would attack any intruders they see.” He sighed at the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi noticed these shadows hiding in the sea.

Remember, you can abandon ship and jump to the bone piles if necessary, but never fall into the water no matter what happens. If you do, it will be the end of you; escaping would be even more difficult than reaching the heavens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group memorized his warning. Even though there was still a lot of spirits around, Li Qiye didn’t mind too much. His focus was on Fairy, evident by his occasional glances. In fact, he was very worried about her emotional instability because it could end in an eruption. As he had said before, dealing with a furious Immortal Emperor would be very problematic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the situation was looking fairly optimistic since she remained stable just like the glowing moonlight that’s encompassing her body. She even had a smile on her face, as if she was recalling some happy memories.</span></p>

They didn’t get too far before another ship came by. An old man was glad to see them and called out: “Young Noble Li, may I have an audience?”</span></p>

What kind of conditions are you bringing with you this time?” Ruyan chuckled after seeing the old man.</span></p>

As the Puresun Island Lord, it was not his place to eavesdrop. Xiong Qianbei didn’t dare to stay even more. He followed the daoist and kept guard on the deck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Bonesea is too large, it wasn’t easy to find you, Young Noble.

He was much more polite and respectful compared to the last time. Keep in mind that the pavilion was an incredible lineage in Heaven Spirit. One sect with three sea gods was enough to let them talk proudly to any other power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an elder, he commanded great respect, so his courteous act towards Li Qiye was quite sincere. Of course, Li Qiye showed him respect as well, contrary to his usual nonchalant act.</span></p>

This was the belief of many people. Until now, these moves were top secrets and were never passed on to outsiders. In the pavilion itself, fewer than few were able to see the styles, but now, they were willing to give him the first three variations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quite bold and ambitious.” Li Qiye was surprised as well: “It looks like your pavilion is going big this time.”</span></p>

The seven styles might be amazing, but it wasn’t to the level where he must have them. At the same time, he didn’t think they would ever give it to an outsider. Thus, this concession from them was truly astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third elder quickly smiled and added: “Thank you for your kind words.

If you are willing, our Seven Seas Goddess is willing to marry you. At the same time, our dowry will be two sea god weapons. Feel free to put forward more conditions if you would like.”</span></p>

If she was only a disciple, then she could follow her own desires. However, it was different for a lord whose responsibility was to shoulder the rise and fall of their lineage. They were also schoolmasters, thus they understood the heavy responsibilities that ensue.</span></p>

He wryly smiled and said: “Nothing can hide from your keen sight. In this generation, the goddess is indeed the most promising to become the next sea god. Logically speaking, her promotion to being our lord is a grand matter. It should be a magnificent feast, but the Hallowed Ancestor’s situation is not good, so we didn’t want to draw further attention to ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye lightly smiled: “Since you already know that I’m observant, just get everything out in the open. Outside of the life renewal, your pavilion also wants my seed, an imperial bloodline! Thus, you are willing to do everything to succeed so that your goddess will ascend to godhood and have me become the next Immortal Emperor.”</span></p>

You are exceptionally gifted, so wouldn’t it be a great pity if you don't ascend to the throne?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third elder chuckled as well and said: “Ah, well, our pavilion hopes that you can become Immortal Emperor and our lord, the next sea god.”</span></p>

So, Third Elder, let’s cut to the chase if you actually wish to negotiate.”</span></p>

Who can actually be in charge of using the seven styles as a bargaining tool? Who has such guts? If it was any other ancestor from your pavilion, they wouldn’t be willing to bear this mark of a sinner, the full burden of the blame. In your entire sect, only your Hallowed Ancestor dares to make this grand gamble!”</span></p>

Third Elder, I trust the two of them. If I am no longer in Heaven Spirit one day, the Void Imperfection Schools will act as my representatives, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Excuse me, I worried too much, I hope Schoolmasters will forgive me.” The elder quickly cupped his fists and apologized to the two girls.</span></p>

What you truly want is to use my bloodline to give birth to an unfathomable descendant! This will be the revolution of your bloodline, the wish of your Hallowed Ancestor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He only wishes for change.” The elder let out a hollow laugh.</span></p>

He wishes to produce more offspring with my imperial human bloodline. He’s not a fool, so I’m sure he has already explained everything to you beforehand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” The third elder found it difficult to respond because they didn’t have things planned to this point yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye speculated: “I know what your ancestor intends to do. The reproduction of our bloodlines will be the last part of the negotiation. As for your pavilion’s plan, that is even further into the future. He wishes to bring this up after our marriage, when our marital bond and love becomes stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh…” The third elder lost control of this deliberation because it was proceeding too quickly. Both sides hadn’t talked about cooperating just, yet but they had gotten to the latter points already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder quickly said: “Young Noble, if you would like, you can talk to our Hallowed Ancestor about these future plans some other time. If you form an alliance with us, we will not hide anything from you since we will be a family connected by bonds!”</span></p>

The Hallowed Ancestor was someone who had trained two sea gods. He definitely was unmatched in certain aspects. If he was willing to bet on Li Qiye, it showed that he had an even greater plan than just grooming another sea god. The two girls wondered just what was it that he wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and said: “I won’t force you since it is a confidential matter. However, do you mind if I take a guess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” The elder wryly smiled. He was fairly helpless because Li Qiye had guessed correctly twice already. This youth was too devilish.</span></p>

He went on: “There is only one thing your Hallowed Ancestor wishes to do, and that is to sever the sea demon root from all of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third elder was aghast after hearing this! Even though the ancestor didn’t explain in detail, he could extrapolate that this was indeed the case from their conversation. So now, when Li Qiye pinpointed the crux of the matter, it truly frightened him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye faintly smiled and continued: “If I am not mistaken, your ancestor wants to move the Seven Martial Pavilion out of Heaven Spirit! Even if the entire sect cannot leave, at the very least, a portion of your disciples must do so! Because of this, your pavilion wants my imperial bloodline. Only my powerful human bloodline will help your pavilion take root in a different world!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared straight at the elder and declared: “Your ancestor’s target is the Mortal Emperor World’s Northern Grand Sea!”</span></p>

The two girls were surprised as well since this was outside of their imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some sea demons have left Heaven Spirit before, but ultimately, they would return to their roots unless it was an untimely death.</span></p>

This was because in the nine worlds, no other location would be more suitable for their race, especially the Dragon Demon Sea. This was truly their home territory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a living creature, there was no better place than home. Sea demons were simply happy fish in water here. As for the Seven Martial Pavilion, wanting to relocate should be even stranger. They were the leaders of the Dragon Demon Sea, an untouchable behemoth among sea demons. However, they still wanted to leave Heaven Spirit. No one would be able to imagine their thought process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be considered ridiculous if one didn’t hear it with their own ears. It wasn’t easy for a lineage to establish their own base. It required countless efforts from their ancestors. Just imagine, three sea gods have contributed to the pavilion, resulting in them having the largest territory in the Dragon Demon Sea. No one would be willing to give up such a solid foundation and inheritance.</span></p>

Sea demons can’t leave and they definitely can’t cut off their bloodline, their connection to Heaven Spirit.” Ruyan found the statement incredible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled and said: “This depends on their bloodline. If I become an Immortal Emperor and breed with a sea god, the descendants will be able to sever this root due to my ancient bloodline! After several more generations, the pavilion will be able to implement their plan! The Golden Isle has tested my bloodline... it looks like your pavilion is quite good at getting reliable information.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both the girls glanced at each other then stared at the elder whose face has become cloudy and uncertain. He didn’t know what to say for a while.</span></p>

It’s not that simple to have both an Immortal Emperor and a sea god at the same time. Plus, an Immortal Emperor might not give your pavilion any face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, the elder bowed his head and earnestly said: “Young Noble Li, your wisdom is as vast as the sea. You have grasped everything. Your knowledge can only be described as matchless.”</span></p>

Both the girls shivered. As schoolmasters, they thought about a deeper issue. Just why did the pavilion want to abandon their inheritance here and leave Heaven Spirit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more they thought about it, the more afraid they got. An existence like the Hallowed Ancestor was not able to alarm them. The reasoning behind his actions must be earth-shattering.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” The elder awkwardly backed away after being disappointed.</span></p>

Be honest, what is the bottom line of your ancestor? Four styles or perhaps five? In my opinion, five is his limit. The seven styles are indeed unbeatable, but I’m only interested in the last three. The first four might be incredible, but that’s all they are. This is not the case for the last three. Their profundities are worth pondering, especially the final style. This style, for any cultivator, is truly worth researching; even Immortal Emperors are no exceptions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder was tongue-tied once more. None of his thoughts could elude Li Qiye’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye continued after seeing his expression: “If necessary, your ancestor could bear trading the first four moves. The fifth is the limit while the sixth is something he absolutely doesn’t want to put up. Due to his mastery of the styles, he knows more than anyone just how priceless the last two are. The sixth is a sure-kill attack; the moment it comes out, it can determine the outcome of the battle. As for the seventh, it can reverse the tides of the universe. Because of this, he absolutely won’t trade the last two.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having said that, Li Qiye waited for the third elder to answer.</span></p>

Even as an elder of the pavilion, he knew less about the seven styles compared to an outsider like Li Qiye. At the same time, Li Qiye was undoubtedly correct. The Hallowed Ancestor gave permission for the first four styles. If Li Qiye insisted on the fifth, he must personally talk to the Hallowed Ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you wish for the fifth, our ancestor is willing to talk with you about it.” He honestly revealed the bottom line.</span></p>

He truly wished for a successful negotiation. After all, this would be considered a great merit for him.</span></p>

It is simply impossible for us to give you all seven, absolutely impossible. It might be bad news, but it is the truth. I am being sincere this time, so I won’t lie to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye said: “I know.

It is impossible to see him since we can’t revive him.”</span></p>

Everyone knew that the Prime Sea God wasn’t alive. Their pavilion had never tried to hide it. In fact, if they had a living sea god, they wouldn’t need to ask Li Qiye for this favor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Li Qiye insisted on seeing Prime which was shaking the elder’s mind. Could the pavilion’s Prime Sea God actually be alive? He carefully thought about it and dispelled this notion. If Prime was still alive, then it meant that the Trident had always been in their possession.</span></p>

Even though they had never left Heaven Spirit, they knew from their readings that outside of their world, other people never mentioned the sea demons and treants as part of the great races.</span></p>

Even though a treefather might be dead, he will still return to the origin and take root in the earth. A tree controller will be able to communicate with an ancestral tree.” The intelligent Ruyan immediately connected sea gods and treefathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye answered: “Right and wrong. The process treefathers undergo is unique to them. However, returning to the origin is something similar between the two types of existences.”</span></p>

He had given them too many surprises, but in this split second, she thought about a terrifying matter. Her heart trembled and she had to ask: “What about us, the charming spirits?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye gave her another look and cheerfully praised: “You sisters are indeed amazing. If you work together, what will your limit be? Ruyan is sharp while Jianshi is wise. Your ancestors electing you two as schoolmasters prove just how far-sighted they are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan coquettishly said: “Young Noble, there’s no need to praise us, just tell us the answers.” They weren’t happy from his praise since they were hellbent on understanding what was behind all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at them and finally chuckled: “I shouldn’t be telling you this, but we have already reached this point. Out of consideration for your hard work and hospitality, I can tell you a little. In the sense of your origins, your three races are quite similar and are interconnected. At the very least, you were all part of the same race in the beginning…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“... However, charming spirits are different from the other two. Your race will have a better future than them. It’s just as people say, you are the favored children of the heavens.”</span></p>

The villainous heavens will never favor a race or any person. If it did, it would be a bunch of devils! So, with regard to that phrase, even if your race is loved and adored, this affection isn’t coming from the heavens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two quietly listened to Li Qiye. He didn’t explain everything clearly, but they found themselves to be lost in a reverie of thoughts.</span></p>

After all, knowing might not necessarily be a good thing. It can even affect your dao heart.” Li Qiye smiled: “But the answer for your race lies in the great maelstrom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The great maelstrom!” They couldn’t help but shudder after hearing this all-too-familiar name again.</span></p>

What was it that made you change your mind?” Ruyan had this question brewing in her mind the entire time. Jianshi was just as curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The status of sea god was a different matter. It could be said that in the beginning, he could have made this request. It showed that he didn’t have any interest during the first meeting. However, on this second meeting with the elder, Li Qiye changed his mind; he didn’t even want the seven styles. Thus, the two girls wanted to know what the catalyst behind this change of heart was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me, am I a good person?” Li Qiye asked a sudden and strange question instead.</span></p>

Some people have said that I am a good person while others argued for the opposite. I have always wanted to be a bad person, but time and time again, some still think that I am good. This world, it can make a person feel very helpless at times.”</span></p>

They were slightly moved and instantly realized something at the same time. Intuition told them that his change of heart might have something to do with Fairy. However, they recalled the events and found this to be implausible.</span></p>

For example, some skeletons were swimming in the sea while others were soaring in the sky. There was something different about these skeletons and spirits. As for the exact disparity, the group couldn’t tell. However, the intuition of a master was telling them so.</span></p>

Their fangs were hundreds of meter long like two sharp blades. After countless years, they still had a flashing glint. Another resembled a giant crane with only one leg left half submerged in the water. The single leg looked like a pillar upholding a gigantic city of bones.</span></p>

It was not a giant like they imagined but a skeletal monkey no different from an ordinary monkey. Anyone would find it unthinkable to see such a skeleton have this big of a palm. How could it grow on such a little body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan asked while still surprised: “What is it this time?”</span></p>

With lightning speed, she slashed towards the monkey with a billowing aura that rampaged across the sky!</span></p>

Despite the visual oddity of the size disparity, its attack was seamless, smooth, and even faster than lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” She couldn’t block the attack despite being covered in an imperial aura. She was blown away through the sky but luckily fell onto a different giant skeleton.</span></p>

Her blood energy instantly erupted.</span></p>

However, he was inferior with regards to blood energy. Under the Sacred Spring Physique, her blood energy was as vast as an ocean and seemingly saturated the entire Bonesea beyond its limit!</span></p>

A ten-thousand-meter tall wave was created by this force.</span></p>

The exchange went even, but she didn’t want to let up at all.</span></p>

Her most powerful weapon was this axe, not her imperial sword or some true treasure. This was due to its tailored suitability for her. An elegant and graceful beauty carrying an axe larger than a mountain was simply outrageous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” She swung her axe once again at the divine monkey’s palm. Under her wild blood energy, the axe crazily accelerated with more weight and power behind it! Its sundering blow left a scar in the sky.</span></p>

Nevertheless, its endless blood energy made each move quite invincible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monkey screamed. Its palm turned into a fist that could seal the six dao and headed straight for the axe.</span></p>

He couldn’t imagine a slender girl like Jianshi wielding such a great axe. Li Qiye was amused at the scene but continued forward without thinking too much about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t get far before he batted an eye and smiled towards Ruyan: “Your turn to protect the ship, don’t destroy it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan charmingly smiled in response: “Don’t worry, Young Noble.

The moment she opened it, a bunch of smoke came out along with endless fire. In a split second, this heat incinerated the entire ship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it turned out that strands of bone had come out of the sea and suddenly spread across the entire ship as if wanting to grow on it. At this moment, Ruyan controlled her fire and burned all of these silk-like strands off the ship. Even though it was ruthlessly burning these bone strands away, it didn’t harm the ship at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oddly enough, under the gushing torrents of fire, these bony strands sizzled but weren’t burn to death. The stronger the flame, the faster they grew. In the blink of an eye, they filled the entire ship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A bit interesting.” Ruyan smirked and controller her cauldron. Her body suddenly lit up with the activation of her Heaven Devourer Evil Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, a terrifying vortex appeared inside the cauldron as black flames came out. This new flame burned countless bony strands to ashes. Don’t underestimate her cauldron, its name was the Evil Physique Immortal Cauldron, personally cast by her school’s progenitor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a grand completion user, this progenitor actually used her own bones to create this cauldron! It had an extremely terrifying power. If a disciple who trained in the evil physique controlled this cauldron, its power would be amplified multiples times.</span></p>

Qianbei could only sit on the deck and watch Ruyan resist this crazy bony growth. His cultivation was too weak, so he couldn’t help her at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zzz—” In the midst of his daze, a very quiet noise came about.</span></p>

It crazily grew and appeared all over his body, scaring the soul out of him.</span></p>

He couldn’t cry out anymore as his body convulsed. It was very painful. Eventually, his struggling weakened. It was obvious that he would die to these strands.</span></p>

A blood energy swelled as if a thousand dragons were roaring in his body. His bloodline instantly grew stronger.</span></p>

They shattered all of the bony strands that were wrapped around his body!</span></p>

He sat planted his butt on the deck. The howling dragon aura was nowhere to be found, and his blood energy had returned to its usual level. He was still an insignificant human cultivator.</span></p>

The ship headed deeper into the Bonesea. Along the way, they met more skeletons that attacked them, but they couldn’t stop Li Qiye’s advance. Under his control, the ship moved as fast as a soaring dragon.</span></p>

Qianbei saw a skeleton that resembled a dragon lying on the sea. There was a jumping flame by its stomach akin to a blossoming flower. It was in a perpetual cycle of blooming then withering then blooming again… Upon closer inspection, people would find that it was not a group of flames but an ancient rune. It was unreasonably complicated with flashing lights, as if stars were being created inside.</span></p>

This posture made it seem that even during its last moment, it didn’t give up. However, this was not the case, it simply had a sun in its mouth.</span></p>

This was quite a rare sight. It was full of mists, giving it the appearance of an immortal land. If this island appeared in a blue ocean, people would actually think that immortals lived there.</span></p>

People couldn’t see it completely due to poor visibility. Nevertheless, they could still tell that the tablet was made from a completely black metal. There were markings on it that could be text or morphing runes. It was impossible to see what the marks were due to the mist.</span></p>

Despite being the Evil Devourer Schoolmaster and seeing countless treasures while growing up, she was still very interested in this tablet that was capable of improving her physique.</span></p>

She activated her immortal physique instantly. An evil energy floated around her body, causing a demoness like her to look even more seductive.</span></p>

From afar, he already looked monstrous in size. They had no choice but to look up as they got closer, but no one could see the top of its head. Anyone would feel as insignificant as an ant before such a giant, regardless of their status and ability.</span></p>

Some of them do not have a true fate weapon at grand completion since they refine their bodies into unique weapons. Some refer to this phenomenon as an Immortal Physique weapon. Of course, there are those that think this type of art is considered part of the foreign dao.”</span></p>

Even though some treasures could grow as large as a galaxy, they were simply illusions or avatar forms; their true size wouldn’t be that large, unlike this sword. Only a divine sword of this size was worthy of being this giant’s weapon.</span></p>

Its value and power are not weaker than any Immortal Emperor true fate weapons. Its mysteries far exceed what you can imagine.” [1. The raw is Colossal Immortal Imperial Blade, but that’s a mouthful. Just remember that the word imperial is there, so its previous master might have been a king/emperor.]</span></p>

As a schoolmaster, not only was her cultivation powerful, her knowledge was vast as well. However, the tales of this sword eluded her.</span></p>

I’m afraid no sect in this world has any records about this sword that belonged to the Colossal Immortal Race.” After seeing her puzzled appearance, Li Qiye laughed and gently shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Colossal Immortal Race?

They are too ancient to be traced as their origin is even older than the charming spirits.”</span></p>

This existence in front of us is comparable to Immortal Emperors, but death was still the final outcome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An existence comparable to Immortal Emperors?” She was shaken once more after this terrifying revelation.</span></p>

Nothing in this world could compare to Immortal Emperors, but one of them was dead right here. This was beyond his imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at the contemplating old man and answered: “It was an unbelievable war. This race was unbelievably strong; they lasted until the very end of that war during their era. Unfortunately, they failed in the end and faced genocide; this great existence before you was no exception.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such words made the two listeners shudder.

It is better than your Myriad Earth Axe, especially if you can refine it. Your Sacred Spring Physique offers unlimited blood energy, so with this sword, you will be able to meet god, slay god; meet devil, slay devil!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianbei stared at the sword without its hilt in sight. He had personally witnessed Jianshi endless blood energy. If she could wield this sword, her empowered slash would be unbelievable and more than enough to destroy a lineage or even a race. Perhaps even the Dragon Demon Sea would be split into two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi’s heart started to beat faster while looking at the sword. It was indeed suitable for her Immortal Physique. She understood the strength of this type of weapon due to her axe. Obtaining this sword would raise her fighting power by several levels instantly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s yours if you can pull it out.” He grinned and said: “This is a test for your physique. Can it support such a huge sword?”</span></p>

However, not just anyone could use it. It was one thing to be strong enough to lift it, but to treat it as a weapon was prohibitively difficult. Just swinging it a few times could squeeze a paragon dry, and using it effectively in battle was even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others would find it impossible, but this only stimulated her desire. After all, her physique had a unique advantage. Even a Godking might not have more blood energy than her. She could surely sustain this sword with her circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, she took a deep breath and leaped forward to land on the giant’s feet, then she began to climb up its leg. She looked exactly like an ant. Just imagine, an ant climbing up a gigantic pillar — this was no easy task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was quite fast and made her way to its wrist by jumping. The giant’s hands were gripping the hilt. They looked like two mountains holding up another mountain. It was easier said than done to pull out such a great sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her inner physique emerged with her soaring blood energy.

Nevertheless, she didn’t give up. Her energy soared for a second time and her inner physique turned incomparably bright. It was several times greater than the previous time she activated it! She was determined to obtain this sword no matter the cost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye watched from a distance for a bit before smiling and sailed his boneship away again.

I can’t compare to the island lord or the schoolmasters, so I don’t have any foolish wishes about these legacies. Following you here and obtaining these eight eyes is more than enough for me.”</span></p>

If a powerful cultivator were to open their heavenly gaze, they would see a shocking scene. The tablet on that island was opening its jaws and swallowing the darkness in the sky.

With efforts from your branches, you will still be able to train an incredible existence. It’s not like this egg’s bloodline is bad. The only reason is why it can’t evolve into a true divine beast is that in this world, the conditions for it to reach atavism can’t be met.”</span></p>

In theory, the more effort you spend trying to cultivate it, the higher the chance for atavism.

Okay, so let’s say that such a world exists. It would be very simple, every single existence and citizen of the four branches will have to use their blood energy to gestate it on top of utilizing all possible treasures. In other words, every ounce of your resources. However, this isn’t worth it. Then what if a world allows for this? Do you think it’s worth the effort of an entire race and all of their resources to create a true dragon or phoenix? With your resources, it is possible and more efficient to train three Immortal Emperors instead of a single divine beast.”</span></p>

His ship drifted wherever the seawater flowed. This atmosphere was one of rumination; everyone had their own thoughts.</span></p>

A treasure? Is there one at the bottom of the sea?”</span></p>

Throughout history, many emperors have been here before, and some made it to the deepest location of the Bonesea. Do you think people in this generation will still have a turn in this?”</span></p>

Who could be stronger than Immortal Emperors? In fact, even sea gods and treefathers had been here before. These characters would have taken away the item of immortality if it actually existed.</span></p>

In a distant era, some passages regarding this legend were written, but they are very few in number so not many are aware of it. It goes like this: ever since the Bonesea was known to be, there has been a shadow in the waters here. It is just like a ghost, appearing and disappearing for millions of years. Generations passed, but this shadow continues to be. It is an eternal existence in the Bonesea.”</span></p>

According to his sect’s records, the Bonesea was beyond traceability. Some even said that it was impossible to try and figure out its beginning.</span></p>

Immortal Emperor Gu Chun was the first emperor and lived during the Desolate Era. However, even his sect didn’t have any clues on the origin of the Bonesea. From this, one could see just how ancient it was.</span></p>

Some believe that it is an existence, others say that it is just a projection of the Bonesea. Another speculation states that it is an unrelenting ghost… In short, no one has seen what it is, or at least what its true form is.”</span></p>

It was very cloudy, and some of the regions even had water as black as ink. How could anyone see a shadow within these waves?</span></p>

We can’t take too many treasures and fortunes from here. There are many places to visit at the Bonesea, so there’s no need to waste too much time here. If we’re lucky, maybe we can find the missing item from your schools.” He laughed loudly after mentioning this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Jianshi’s eyes lit up, accentuating her mature allurement even more.</span></p>

However, the chance is quite high in this generation. Your luck can be said to be very good from having met me. The Bonesea is different this time too, so some items that should appear will appear!” His eyes flashed at this point.</span></p>

The group made preparations to kill the powerful skeletons at a moment’s notice. However, contrary to their expectations, this dangerous zone was strangely calm. There were no flying skeletons or anything that came to attack them.</span></p>

Outside of the large skeletons on the surface, nothing else could be found. The whole place gave an empty and silent feel.</span></p>

Even when countless treasures presented themselves, he didn’t bother batting an eye as if indicating that they were nothing.

Even though it has been quite a long time since his departure, they still believed that he would be back just fine.</span></p>

Loud explosions came about as if it was the end of the world.</span></p>

At first, they thought an evil spirit was attacking the ship. However, they quickly found that this trembling wasn’t caused by the region but the ship itself.</span></p>

The initially calm Fairy was now emitting an immortal brilliance like a sun that was about to erupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her light seemed to be forming its own world. The most frightening part was that the power within was completely matchless. It seemed that this was an everlasting power that had been slumbering for countless years. However, it was waking up at this very moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even scarier was her unstable status. Her expression kept on changing from happy to sad. Her unstable mood made this boundless immortal light unstable as well. This matchless power was about to explode at any moment. Even though it was still contained within her body, the escaping plumes of light were already frightening enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were mere insignificant strands of power. If the entire force of her world were to escape, it would be completely invincible and world-destroying. Not even an Immortal Emperor could top this.</span></p>

Who can stop her?” His diamond physique couldn’t even withstand a single strike from her. The physique that was supposedly indestructible seemed as soft as tofu, so who could try to stop this invincible woman? This was an existence on the level of emperors, so attempting to stop her was equivalent to courting death.</span></p>

She was shocked and unleashed her blood energy in order to block the force, but it was futile. She was blown away and spun several times in the air before landing on the deck. Nevertheless, her churning blood energy made her spit out blood.</span></p>

He took a deep breath as his body lit up with a golden light. At this moment, he has channeled his diamond physique to its limit.</span></p>

His body began to deform as if there was a great boulder on top of him, but he didn’t give up and gritted his teeth to continue forward. Alas, this force from Fairy was too powerful; it continued to destroy his diamond physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this physique was capable of swift recovery, it was of no use under this pressure.</span></p>

A long crack appeared on his body. He continued to advance, but more cracks appeared with blood seeping out of them. The diamond physique was now unable to heal his wounds at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Ultimately, he failed to reach Fairy. His body was blown away in a worse fashion than Jianshi. He flew out of the ship like a shooting star.</span></p>

They didn’t dare to approach, so they wanted to escape. However, there was no way of bringing her with them. If she were to die with the sinking ship, they wouldn’t be able to face Li Qiye. They glanced at each other in this difficult moment of powerlessness.</span></p>

However, the same thing happened to him. The moment he approached, a bone-crushing sound came about. Blood immediately stained his robe as her invincible power began to grind him down!</span></p>

With a loud blast, he used his Pentadao Timeless Seal on this entire region. He sealed this boneship not to protect himself, but to separate her from the Bonesea. His initial goal was to use it to restore her memories, but its effect on her was too great so he had no choice but to isolate her from the Bonesea.</span></p>

This is not a seal, it is simply sleeping. Perhaps it was due to her own choice, or there might be other reasons, but regardless of the reason, she definitely has the power of an Immortal Emperor. Even if someone in this generation were to accept the Heaven’s Will and ascend to the throne, she will still be able to contend against them!” The daoist sighed after saying this.</span></p>

The moment they went inside, they saw Li Qiye slumped over with blood everywhere on his body. There were countless cracks on his figure, making him look like a broken piece of ceramic.

The distant era it came from is not the same as our current nine worlds. Even though that era was truly exceptional, a creature like a Kun Peng would rarely appear. This was unexpected to the inhabitants of that time as well. Many things remain unclear about the past, but our nine worlds can no longer give birth or even handle the existence of a creature at this level!”</span></p>

Even if an emperor dies and turns into bones, it doesn’t mean that they are weaker than a Kun Peng. A divine beast is unique. Plus, there are gaps between emperors as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group pondered a bit.

The emperor did it in order to understand the attack even more so that he could fuse it perfectly with his Immortal Physique. Because he enlightened himself with the technique from watching the Kun Peng’s bright totem, he wanted to feel its power through its bone. Only with that would he be able to truly cultivate the Windchase Break. Without doing so, even if you forcefully learn it, the power of the strike would be greatly reduced and your Immortal Physique itself would be injured after using it.”</span></p>

Unfortunately, these ancestors embarked on a path with no return.”</span></p>

He wanted to comprehend the dao just like the wise emperors more than anything because his sect already had enough treasures. Comprehending the dao, on the other hand, would benefit him for a lifetime.</span></p>

Some chose to abandon their ships while others used the rivers to float through it. The majority came here for treasures because the sudden appearance of this continent sounded promising. Moreover, the object of immortality might be hidden here as well.</span></p>

Some dug up every corner of the earth in order to find hidden artifacts, but they were disappointed very quickly. There were no signs of treasures. It was as if only mud and soil were to be found, not even a blade of grass could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when many cultivators felt upset, some people finally found places that spewed out a brilliance. In just one day, there were two known locations that people started running over to. They assumed that there were supreme treasures hidden underground or even possibly the object of immortality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this excitement didn’t last long. One of the locations was instantly occupied and no one could interfere.</span></p>

The brilliance here made it seem like a magnificent portal to an immortal realm. It looked like a long belt that haunted the entire mountain. Little particles would fall into the ground and turn into profound ancient runes. Each of these dao runes was like flowers and plants since they would blossom then wither. This whole process was very short as if they were deriving a supreme grand dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people started to palpitate before this scene. A knowledgeable paragon realized something right away and exclaimed: “This is not a place to find immortal treasures. It is meant for dao enlightenment.”</span></p>

The area was occupied immediately, and those who occupied it had no intention of sharing. The person who took over was Meng Zhentian. His carriage slowly climbed to the top of this mountain. His generals and soldiers immediately drove all the cultivators away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This land initially didn’t belong to anyone. A dao land like this should be shared with everyone, but Meng Zhentian took it for himself. This made many people unhappy, but their discontent remained unvoiced. No one dared to oppose Meng Zhentian, so they quietly left after being chased away. His regiment surrounded the whole mountain, not allowing anyone to get close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cultivator couldn’t help but mutter against this overbearing action: “Why so arrogant? This isn’t your house. Everyone should have a share, so on what basis is he chasing us away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could finish, his seniors had covered his mouth and quietly scolded: “Are you tired of living?! This is the future Immortal Emperor, opposing him is the same as courting death. Even if you want to die, don’t drag the sect down with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this senior, everyone was angry but didn’t dare to speak out. They all knew that in the current generation, Meng Zhentian will be undefeated. Nothing can stop him. His momentum to reach the Heaven’s Will was unstoppable already. Smart people would obediently make way for him lest a disaster strikes them in the near future.</span></p>

When it emerged from the Bonesea, the seawater flowed back which made up many rivers and lakes in the area. This lake with the brilliance was one of them.</span></p>

Standing on one side and looking forward made it seem like an ocean. Of course, because the water was the same as the currents in the Bonesea, one required a boneship in order to enter the lake. Because of this, the cultivators who chose to remain on their ships were much luckier than the ones who abandoned them.</span></p>

Its progenitor was lucky enough to find some of this wood and began the construction of these vessels. Of course, this sect wasn’t the only one who had them right now. For example, Meng Zhentian was sitting on a vessel gifted to him by the Roaring Conch.</span></p>

Despite his soaring blood energy, he was the one bending down instead. He was like a true dragon in the sky and tried his best to stand upright.</span></p>

His body bent down again. He was only inches away yet it was impossible to reach. Eventually, he let out one more roar. The divinity of the sword radiated a dazzling light as he unleashed a heaven-defying slash at the miniature tower.</span></p>

They knew that there was a matchless treasure inside the tower, and even if there was no treasure, this was probably a great place to learn the dao. However, what was the point of this great location if no one could enter? There was no one else for them to rely on. Even a Godking might not be much stronger than the Swiftdao God.</span></p>

Their combined effort failed to withstand a single move from the daoist. At this moment, they finally understood that the daoist was already a Godking. The difference in power was too large.

If he didn’t beat Li Qiye today, he would lose all of his reputation as a Godking.</span></p>

He realized many things after seeing this weapon, that Li Qiye didn’t only have all twelve Immortal Physiques, he also possessed their true mysticisms! This was someone who could collect all of them at grand completion!</span></p>

Those who were more cowardly would find their legs give way. No one would dare to look down on Zhentian, the most promising candidate to be emperor. Moreover, his strength was at its peak. In all of Heaven Spirit, there were only a few from the older generation who could match him.</span></p>

His palm seemed to be that of the heavens, grasping the universe as the ruler of all. It seemed that all existences in the nine worlds belonged in his hand. This single hand could crush all lives.

A huge portal opened on the mountain where Meng Zhentian was. The moment it opened, a loud blast resounded like a heavenly thunder.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Godkings found it difficult to resist and could only resort to fleeing!</span></p>

He withdrew his palm and the same immortal brilliance that contained the four divine beasts gushed forward on the mountain. This power from Meng Zhentian engulfed the entire Bonesea. It was as if he had suddenly turned into an Immortal Emperor capable of dealing with all tribulations. Anyone would be in awe of this display of might.</span></p>

The majority of the Bonesea was open. Even though there were dangers, the powerful or lucky could still survive. However, the central area was a forbidden zone. Even Godkings could die at any moment in there. Rumor has it that only Immortal Emperors could invade that area and come out alive.</span></p>

He used Space Connection to draw the power of the forbidden zone, but this was greatly restricted.</span></p>

Even if Li Qiye had great mastery over this art, he would need to make preparations and expend a tremendous amount of effort because the Bonesea itself was a sealed space. It had an eternal and invincible defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was much easier to connect the space when inside the Bonesea. Because of this, he was able to draw the power of the forbidden zone relatively easily. Of course, he was still subjected to the suppression within, so he could only direct a little bit of this power. Otherwise, its full force would have rendered Zhentian to ashes in an instant. This was a force that not even emperors could necessarily challenge!</span></p>

His deep and fierce eyes changed quite a bit. Despite his enmity with Li Qiye, he chose against seeking revenge for his concubine. Prior to this, he couldn’t see through Li Qiye’s strength but still knew that he wasn’t a match. At this moment, he learned that it was quite a far-sighted choice.

Everyone was waiting for the boat to appear once more to see if they could have a chance after Li Qiye enters. After a long time, a light finally came down and turned into a little boat. Li Qiye sat down, letting it take him towards the tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even Ruyan and Jianshi were anxious for Li Qiye’s success because their Windchase Break was inside. When the boat finally arrived in front of the tower, Li Qiye went out without hesitation.</span></p>

He flung his sleeve and spread his palm. In the blink of an eye, he formed more than ten mudras. They were mysterious and indescribable. Even the talented Puresun couldn’t understand all of these hand seals.</span></p>

No one could see through them at all. Li Qiye himself didn’t bother giving them a second glance. It wasn’t strange for him to know this particular method since this was not his first time here. He had brought Immortal Emperors to this place to comprehend the dao.</span></p>

Many strands of dao laws began to swim in his palm. They floated to the tower like water. A long while later, ancient profound runes emerged on the door itself. They would sometimes look like a Kun Peng diving into the sea or leaping towards the sky. They were quite agile and lifelike.</span></p>

He said that he was the only one qualified to enter the tower. At that time, many thought that he was arrogant and wanted to monopolize the tower for himself.

Nevertheless, Puresun was quite talented and could be praised as the one who has read the most within his sect. Not only was he the most powerful among the younger generation, he was the most knowledgeable as well.</span></p>

From the outside, it looked like an ordinary building, but it was completely different once inside. People would find that they have entered a new world. Looking up would result in a vast sky full of stars. It seemed like it was night time for Li Qiye.</span></p>

They would also be astonished not because of the vastness of this place, but due to the two rows of giants standing to the left and right. They towered to the sky with both hands placed on hilts of giant swords in front of their chests.</span></p>

If Ruyan’s group was here, they would be quite shaken to see the two giants because they looked just like the corpse from the Colossal Immortal Race.</span></p>

It contained the origin of the Windchase Break. Because of this, he traced it all the way back here and finally found this place. He tried to use it in order to learn the Windchase Break again.

This sea of stars could support countless lives. Even the nine worlds seemed trivial in comparison.</span></p>

If this Kun Peng was still young, then it could only be said that it was born in the wrong era. If it had completely matured, it wouldn’t have died in this place. This would have changed the wheel of time. Countless eras would have been different, and the same goes for all of the inhabitants. History itself would have to be rewritten.</span></p>

They spun like thirteen stars and derived a supreme grand world. Inside this world was the inhabitants of the universe, billions and billions of them basking in the brilliance of the sun and moon…</span></p>

The only thing left in their place was a vast emptiness with a primordial force. This energy pervaded the area without dispersing.</span></p>

It wasn’t particularly loud, but it seemed to travel from the past to the future — a force capable of crossing one era to another. The primordial chaos was finally opened. If anyone was standing here, they would feel that this was the beginning of a new world.</span></p>

It was simple and unadorned yet very real and coarse. A pure energy slowly came by while the impurities descended. A light flashed everywhere in this new dawn. This energy turned into stars and the flow of water turned into an ocean. The quaking of the chaos turned into the sounds of the world…</span></p>

A cultivator could create a grand dao. However, to a large extent, it would only be grasping the heavenly dao and using its rules to create a new dao. Because of this, the path of the heavens became a popular belief. A dao creator could eventually be recognized by the Heaven’s Will and compete for it to become emperor.</span></p>

If this dao failed to be recognized by the Heaven’s Will, the user wouldn’t be able to enter the competition to be emperor. Only grand dao recognized by the Heaven’s Will would earn this opportunity to vie for the throne.</span></p>

This was not only the start of his dao, it has taken a step further towards improvement. Although there was still a long way to go before perfection, this step made him understand his dao even more. He knew what path he was taking and what was needed.</span></p>

Although none of them knew how to enter, no one was willing to give up. This was especially true for the stronger crowd.

His eyes flashed upon seeing Li Qiye. In the past, he saw Li Qiye as being unfathomable like a slumbering beast that could devour all enemies at any moment. But now, he felt that Li Qiye was too simple, as if nothing was there. Finally, he noticed an ephemeral glimpse, one where Li Qiye was the world and the world was Li Qiye, an all-encompassing and omnipresent being.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their boneships eventually left the lake and sailed deeper into the main area in the sky.</span></p>

One spoke with a hint of regret: “What a pity, we won’t see a fight between him and Zhentian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone looked over at Zhentian’s mountain and replied: “It will happen. Once Zhentian comes out of his cultivation, he will probably come and seek Li Qiye for revenge. Just stay at the Bonesea and we’ll see the fight for sure.” The immortal energy was still faintly showing on the mountain so Zhentian was surely still meditating.</span></p>

Their eyes turned towards the tower. Some were quite excited and even thought about trying to enter.</span></p>

He was the first to occupy the entrance. Even though he gave it to Li Qiye earlier, logically speaking, he should be the first to enter now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, reason faltered to strength in the cultivation world. The only “justice” right now was that he was too powerful and no one here dared to oppose him. Thus, as long as he was here, no one tried to compete. He looked at the tower and gently sighed. He decided against entering and drifted away instead.</span></p>

He wasn’t one to underestimate himself and was even confident in catching up to Meng Zhentian in a few years. Nevertheless, he understood the gap between him and Zhentian right now. Furthermore, the one suffocating him was actually Li Qiye; he was even more deterring than Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gap between him and Zhentian was discernible, but Li Qiye was completely unfathomable. He simply couldn’t see through Li Qiye’s true strength at all.</span></p>

He has become quite complacent recently, but now, he had no choice but to admit that Heaven Spirit was full of talents. If Puresun was also on the path of the heavens, he would definitely be a great rival in the future. The Swiftdao God left, exasperated from knowing that there was still a long way to go. He must work even harder.</span></p>

She contained her excitement and bowed towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble, this is the greatest kindness you have given to our Void Imperfection Schools. We will never forget and hope that we shall be able to repay you one day.”</span></p>

You want to marry him anyway, so why be hesitant about a kiss? If he actually becomes emperor one day, it will be you taking advantage of him. Not just anyone in this world is qualified to kiss an Immortal Emperor.”</span></p>

Even the mighty Zhentian wouldn’t easily tread into that area. He had the ambition to become emperor, so he would still be confident about coming out alive. However, an indelible wound was a real worry. This was something that could shake his dao heart.</span></p>

Everything could have been different.”</span></p>

The power of this large funnel was too powerful. Even though it was inferior to the maelstrom back in the Abyss Sea, it was still quite terrifying and dangerous. Even a Godking would be torn to pieces if they fell inside.</span></p>

Li Qiye couldn’t see anything due to this darkness, but he could feel the shuttle falling down with increasing velocity. Occasionally, it would violently quake back and forth as if it was about to fall apart at any moment.</span></p>

The main difference was that there was a large taiji diagram that looked like its own world. Even though it was rotating slowly, it was the core that dragged everything else along.</span></p>

He was different back then since he used to be a ferocious demon dragon. He launched an assault on this place and, under his relentless fury, he destroyed a part of the Yin force and brought it back home to be sealed.</span></p>

Another reason was that he didn’t want others to obtain this particular item, so he destroyed half of this diagram.</span></p>

This was an unthinkable move. With his dao foundation sealed, even if he was stronger, he wouldn’t be able to retaliate. This turned him into a defenseless bookworm; even a mortal could kill him at this moment.</span></p>

Even though this rendered him helpless, there was one particular advantage — his dao foundation wouldn’t suffer any damage. This left him completely vulnerable, but his core would be able to withstand a world-destroying attack and remain intact.</span></p>

He opened his eyes with a faint smile on his face. This new world with rosy clouds in the sky was magnificent. It seemed that this location was spewing out divine mists and clouds. Everything seemed incredibly soft. Walking in this land gave a strange comforting feel as if there was a pretty flower field beneath their feet.</span></p>

He released his own true fate while converging all of his blood energy into his dao foundation. Like this, his true fate was left defenseless.

The aura here was very rich with life. Those who immersed themselves here would get the feeling of nirvana and rebirth, a fluttering sensation of living again.

It seemed capable of destroying all things. Even Godkings would prostrate in horror before its coming.</span></p>

Only Immortal Emperors would be able to withstand this will. However, Li Qiye was still all-smiles before it. He opened his arms and said: ”Come, kill me! If you can’t kill me completely, I will exchange my life right here! I highly doubt that there is another existence in this world besides the villainous heavens that is capable of killing me!”</span></p>

Of course, if there’s something or someone that thinks they can destroy me or trap me here, I welcome all attempts. I actually want to see how hard it is to challenge a world. Back then, I suffered long enough at the old villainous heavens’ place, but the taste of defeat has escaped me. Will you allow me to feel this sensation again? To see if this place can handle me?”</span></p>

I have taken the little girl outside. The truth is that I actually hope to cause some trouble today so that the Bonesea will be livelier and that she can regain her clarity soon. This is who I am. I will never let those who trouble me off so easily! Haha, the Maelstrom, the divine ridge, and me as well... will the Bonesea be able to wait till that day?”</span></p>

He continued to talk to himself with a grin: “Time is up. Either I leave the Trident here or it is time to play! In that case, let the disaster come a bit earlier to Heaven Spirit. An early arrival means an early end. Regardless of the outcome, I will take what belongs to me! After the disaster, the creatures of this world can be even more prosperous!”</span></p>

It actually occupied more than half of this lake and didn’t look special at all. Who knows how many years it has been here for? There was no metallic luster to it, as if it was just a piece of scrap metal that had been thrown out.</span></p>

The majority of people would see it as rubbish. Even Immortal Emperors that could tell just how precious it was wouldn’t be able to understand its magical uses. In fact, he only finally understood its mysteries in this generation.</span></p>

The two of them entangled each other like two little flood dragons and floated around.</span></p>

The golden ray was obtained from the golden maelstrom back at the Stone Medicine World where the three ancestral veins collided, and the silver ray was obtained from the silver maelstrom back at the Ancestral Domain. After the acquisition of the silver ray, he finally connected all the dots and understood everything.</span></p>

That’s the dark hand behind the curtains controlling the nine worlds for you, the devil king that can slaughter Immortal Emperors!”</span></p>

In the nine heavens and ten earths, this was probably the only entity that could forcefully seize the trident. What seemed impossible would always be proven otherwise by him. Alas, Bones didn’t have much time to think right now since he had been waiting for this moment. He knew better than everyone else; the moment Li Qiye obtained the Trident was the safest moment in this location due to the earth-shattering changes.</span></p>

They were slightly moved by her words. Not many would dare to refuse Zhentian in Heaven Spirit, especially among the younger generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Jianshi had no qualms in doing so, making people realize and remember that Void Imperfection was a top lineage in this world, a beacon of the charming spirits. Despite knowing that Zhentian could become emperor, she still dared to oppose him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should know that if I want to board, the two of you can’t stop me.” He reiterated with a calm voice. Zhentian didn’t put on an aggressive tone or needlessly postured. His insipid words were enough to show his great confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She clearly uttered: “I know. We can’t stop Senior if you wish to do so, but we will still try!” Her attitude didn’t change from its initial firmness. She didn’t give the slightest leeway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t afraid of Zhentian, only the slumbering Fairy. There was still room for redemption if Zhentian were to take action, but if Fairy were to do something, everyone would die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An existence of the emperor level, once berserk, wouldn’t only kill everyone here. She might even slaughter everyone in the Heaven Spirit World! They didn’t wish to see this at all, especially in Li Qiye’s absence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Zhentian movingly spoke: “Void Imperfection is indeed a leading lineage of the charming spirits. Schoolmasters, there’s no need to be so hostile towards me. We are part of the same race and I do hope that it can flourish. The two of you should know that we all have the duty to revitalize the charming spirits and let its prestige spread far and wide.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people here understood what he was implying. Why was Void Imperfection siding with Li Qiye, a human?! Many spirits were unhappy with this choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our actions will also strengthen the charming spirit race. Alas, we picked a different path to Senior Zhen.” Ruyan faintly smiled.</span></p>

He peacefully said: “Different paths will seek different things. However, today, I just want to talk to Daoist Li. I shall board regardless of whether the two of you agree or not.” His conduct was appropriate for a true master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian’s rhetoric was winning people over. A supreme individual was indeed different. He spoke with admirable elegance without aggressiveness or an imperious attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an Emperor Reserve, he was a genius infinitely close to an Immortal Emperor. He could feel something strange in the boneship. Despite not knowing the details, his intuition was telling him that it was extraordinary. This was the reason for his actions, wanting to wait for Li Qiye was only secondary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jianshi replied: “I’m afraid you will be disappointed. You must get past us if you want to board!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her answer made people think that they were overstepping their bounds. Of course, no one dared to criticize them because the Void Imperfection Schools was still a top power. Moreover, it wasn’t shameful at all for the younger generation to lose to Meng Zhentian. Even a commendable loss was still worthy of pride. Not everyone was qualified to become his enemies.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speaker was Daoist Lin from the Immaculate Expanse!</span></p>

Their sects were in full support of him as well and felt that he was the most promising candidate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you two want to play, I’ll play along.” A steady voice answered the two of them instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two people drifted through the sky. One of the youths had a regal aura while the other looked ordinary. When they walked together, all attention would be on the regal youth!</span></p>

It was easy to tell which was which just by their conflicting auras.</span></p>

They considered themselves to be very strong among the younger generation, but after the previous exchange with Puresun, they realized the great gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu Chun’s four branches...” People began to murmur to themselves, especially the charming spirits. They simply didn’t understand why their lineages would choose to go with Li Qiye instead of Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extreme Yang Monarch and Daoist Lin couldn’t respond right away. Eventually, Lin spoke with a hint of anger: “Puresun Island Lord, we are not afraid of you since we aren’t afraid of anyone. It is just that we don’t wish to go all out against you just yet. Otherwise, we still have the means—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just be frank about being inferior to someone else, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.” Profound sneered after seeing Lin trying to gain some face: “Losing to my senior brother is an honor, so why bother prop yourselves up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun was too honest and nice, but Profound wasn’t like that at all. He was an aggressive bully that would never miss the chance to mercilessly suppress his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The expressions of the other two turned ugly after hearing this, but they didn’t know what to do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The four branches have many outstanding geniuses.” Finally, Zhentian replied from his carriage: “Fellow Daoists, I have already heard of your thunderous fame long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People glanced at Puresun and Profound. It was absolutely a great honor to be praised this highly by Zhentian. Their worth would rise by quite a bit after this. Some would feel as if they were walking on air if Zhentian were to praise them like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brothers had different reactions. Puresun simply smiled with a carefree demeanor as if Zhentian was just another person praising him, but Profound became much more cautious of Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the future war for the Heaven’s Will, Profound’s attitude was very clear. He would support whoever his brother chose. It was apparent at this moment that Puresun had chosen Li Qiye, so despite his general annoyance towards Li Qiye, Profound still stood by his brother’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case, it meant that Meng Zhentian would become their enemy in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puresun gave a leisurely smile and said: “Daoist Meng, you are matchless, so is there a need to make it difficult for juniors like us? How about letting this go? When Brother Li returns, I will let him know so that the two of you can talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew what was in the boneship right now, so he felt the same way as Ruyan and Jianshi. If he had to pick between Zhentian and Fairy as an opponent, he would definitely pick Zhentian. If Fairy were to take action, the outcome would be unpredictable. It could even bring about destruction to Heaven Spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His reply and address towards Meng Zhentian made many people gasp! Daoist Meng — who would dare to address Zhentian in this manner? Not to mention the younger generation, even the previous wouldn’t dare to speak to Zhentian like this! Keep in mind that this was someone who even Immortal Emperor Ta Kong called “older brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Puresun spoke in such a natural and idle manner even when facing Meng Zhentian. This was another reason why Profound respected his brother so much. Regardless of the situation, his brother was always confident like this, someone with an invincible bearing and mentality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People had to take a second look at Puresun. There was a lack of public condemnation, but they felt that this man was being too careless. It was strange to consider himself to be on the same level as Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Zhentian refused to take no for an answer: “Since I’m already here, I should just wait for Daoist Li to come back. His heaven-defying means have completely impressed me. I shall wait on the ship.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was all too curious about what was on the boat. Even a powerful existence like him felt that whatever was on it, it was absolutely unfathomable and without equal in this world!</span></p>

In their eyes, an invincible existence was finally challenged by someone from the younger generation even when the older cultivators would refrain from doing so. They were breathless due to Puresun’s audacity.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some felt great fear after hearing this.

Others would be elated after hearing the praise, but Puresun simply chuckled: “There is always a higher step even at the highest level of enlightenment. In terms of cultivation and mastery, I am not your match as you have walked further than me, but there are things in this world that are too unpredictable. Only through fighting will the victor be known. But then again, even Immortal Emperors have lost. Both victory and defeat are merely methods of honing oneself, there’s no need to look at them as the deciding factor.”</span></p>

No one thought that Li Qiye would be so ready to accept. He looked like he was trying to get this over with or sending away a stray dog. There was no sign of caution at all. The charming spirits felt a little lost after witnessing this scene. Since Zhentian was quite powerful, Li Qiye should at least put up a more cautious front, but he simply didn’t care at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

Li Qiye spoke as if he was facing a nobody who was completely at his mercy, but this was Meng Zhentian! The greatest genius of the charming spirits! His nonchalant attitude was a blatant showing of disdain towards everyone here. The charming spirits glared at him since they felt slighted by his replies!</span></p>

Their feud with Li Qiye had gone past the point of reconciliation long ago! There was a promising future on the horizon, they thought, after joining Zhentian’s camp. Once Zhentian becomes emperor, their future would be boundless.</span></p>

We don’t share the same urine pot, so I don’t need to invite you onboard. If you want to fight, just come out and we’ll do fight, there’s no need for a tea party. If not, then you should go while I’m still in a good mood.”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></span></p>

He would need at least ten years before fully absorbing it. Alas, he was currently enraged.

In his mind, it was either him or Li Qiye who was going to die!</span></p>

No one could open their eyes and look at him directly. He emitted a boundless immortal light that engulfed his body completely.

He only looked around eighteen or nineteen years old while exuding a horrifying aura that could suppress the heavens. While greatly resembling a true god, the opening and closing of his eyes were akin to the changing of day to night. People were awestruck and some even felt the urge to worship him!</span></p>

This was because he represented the charming spirits’ glory in this generation, their hope.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for his aura assaulting the sky vault, no one would connect this youth in front of them to the invincible Meng Zhentian. His disciple, Cao Guojian, was an old man with gray hair. This created quite a gap between reality and what the people had in mind.</span></p>

He understood the gap between the two of them and realized he wasn’t Zhentian’s match. Jianshi and Ruyan were the same. As the saying goes, seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. This first meeting made them realize that his fame was completely well-deserved.</span></p>

Not only was the statement fierce, it was also extremely overbearing and didn’t give Zhentian any face at all. Nevertheless, no one dared to mock or correct Li Qiye for making this comment. He had the qualifications to do so.</span></p>

One camp was slightly regretful because it was only an avatar. At the same time, the charming spirits were especially excited and clenched their fists. Remember that an avatar, regardless of how powerful it might be, would be weaker than the real body. So if Zhentian’s avatar was this strong right now, wouldn’t the arrival of his true body carry a momentum akin to the arrival of an Immortal Emperor?</span></p>

Alas, this wasn’t very surprising considering that he had understood some of the mysteries of the forbidden zone. This allowed him to control this water for a short period of time. Of course, its full power was unattainable for him. Not even Immortal Emperors could do something like that!</span></p>

Back in the octagonal tower, Li Qiye had researched this particular gift. At this moment, he didn’t summon a dead Kun Peng with his Death Chapter, he was using his own knowledge to replicate the dao. Since he has understood its innate gift, it was an easy task for him to borrow its power!</span></p>

Just this nonchalant strike made everything turn gray and feeble. All was incredibly fragile before this behemoth.</span></p>

He roared and his dao turned into myriad laws to seal this area again. One had to admit that Zhentian was quite formidable. He could borrow the power of the gods up above and control the devils from hell below. His simple gestures could shatter the stars and slay galaxies! Plucking the moon and refining myriad realms was a piece of cake to him.</span></p>

No matter what, our four branches will always open our doors to you. Feel free to come any time. Even if I’m not there, my junior brother will represent our sect to take good care of you, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll receive him.” Profound coldly stared at Li Qiye and nodded his head. It didn’t matter how powerful Li Qiye might be, Profound still hated him all the same and didn’t wish to be his friend. Alas, Profound was an interesting person. Despite not seeing eye to eye, he wouldn’t act rude to Li Qiye.</span></p>

It was the least he could do.</span></p>

Puresun didn’t worry either because he was confident in his junior brother being sensible!</span></p>

Profound also said goodbye to the two schoolmasters but ignored Li Qiye.</span></p>

Fairy was still peacefully sleeping inside. She had a gentle smile as if she was having a nice dream.</span></p>

Li Qiye reached out and gently caressed her wondrous face and then sentimentally sighed. This was the most perfect work of art in this world. In the end, he held her right hand and their fingers intertwined before he closed his eyes to fall asleep as well.</span></p>

However, they heard a heartbeat after a while. They thought they were just hearing things, but after paying more attention, there were two separate heartbeats coming from Li Qiye and Fairy in complete harmony!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This heartbeats made the world sound quiet and seemed to be slowing down all of a sudden. They thought they were now in a whole different world.</span></p>

A boundless aura existed alongside an exceedingly pure and vast primordial atmosphere. This breath left others extremely energetic and feeling much younger. Moreover, they would feel their bodies being filled with power as if they had rose several levels.</span></p>

A mythical realm of immortals wouldn’t be much different from this. Alas, such a beautiful world had a crisis unknown to others, a potential existential eradication.</span></p>

Maybe I’m too used to being evil and suddenly got the urge to do something good. Who can really understand people? It is human nature to be perplexing.”</span></p>

Nevertheless, they still attentively listened.</span></p>
 <p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1">[1] This is a term that makes more sense for wuxia because of shorter lifespans. Death cultivation just means a meditation session until death, until they receive a great injury, or they reach the end of their lifespan before they manage to break through.

That place is where I belong, just like how you have your own place that you belong.”</span></p>

Eventually, she stepped off the ship and casually tore apart the void to reveal a portal. The inside of the portal was full of immortal shimmers and mysterious floating laws. It looked like a portal to the immortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She entered it and disappeared right away.

Her pretty features were beyond the capabilities of the pen. Any man would want to make her stay. Moreover, she had a power comparable to Immortal Emperors.

Your futures are very bright, so in just a few years, you will reach grand completion for your Immortal Physiques. At that time, the two of you will be the pride of Void Imperfection, making it even stronger. Being an enemy against an emperor or sea god wouldn’t be an issue then.”</span></p>

Li Qiye happily smiled in response: “I know, this is how it is for the grand dao. I had a good time with you two following me in the recent days. The truth is that if you want to follow me, I would be glad to take you along. However, that would be too selfish of me since I haven’t left anything for your school.” He shook his head and refused.</span></p>

But be ready, there is no beautiful world full of immortals or a peaceful paradise. What awaits us is a larger and crueler world.”</span></p>

She actively wrapped around his neck and kissed him on the lips. Though her actions seemed amateurish, she was still bold and persistent and let caution to the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye simply smiled and held her face while gently sucking on her lips. Ruyan’s lady soul nearly left her body as she felt a numbing sensation throughout her body; it was as if she was melting.</span></p>

This scene felt like the coming of spring.</span></p>

Ruyan was a cheerful woman. Even though the parting was coming, she maintained a cheerful demeanor.</span></p>

We may never meet again in the future after all.” After leaving his embrace, Ruyan winked at Jianshi.</span></p>

Her entire body trembled for she was at a loss for what to do. In a split second, her complexion looked like the sunset in the sky. This demure look would intoxicate others as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ruyan chuckled and whispered next to his ear: “Don’t worry, Young Noble, leave big sis to me. When you return, just get ready to take her in.”</span></p>

The two women watched the whole process. After he disappeared, they felt a strange sense of loss and had a hard time calming down.</span></p>

Bones was still lying around lazily and basking in the sun when he spoke: “It looks like you got unexpectedly rich this time.”</span></p>

He excitedly said: “Of course not, of course not, this is all thanks to Your Excellency’s blessing. I only picked up some leftover soup in the Bonesea to live on, that’s all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and lied down on the chair to say: “Okay, I’m not here to take your stuff so there’s no need to be a sycophant. The items there aren’t ordinary and are more than enough for you to eat for several generations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones let out a fake laugh before handing Li Qiye some nice wine. He stood there respectfully as if ready to listen to a lesson.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones took his time musing this question. Eventually, he sighed and answered: “Your Excellency, so much time has passed that it allowed me to open my eyes. Back then, the truth is that the two of us knew that only one would make it out. Even though that brat tricked me, it didn’t matter too much since I would have done the same given the situation…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones always gritted his teeth and talked about how he wanted to peel Bu Si’s skin. Alas, the reality was that they used to be close brothers.</span></p>

They were able to have different perspectives due to the changing of times.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye looked at him and answered: “Soon. Even though I haven’t been to the Divine Tree Ridge just yet, it won’t be long according to my calculations. The withered have been there for a long time so I believe their experiment is very close to success.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it the same with the Bonesea?” Bones felt a bit frightened.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones smiled wryly and shook his head: “That’s only in the past. My connection with it grows weaker with every passing year. It isn’t because I’m growing weaker but because the Bonesea is becoming stronger to the point where I essentially can’t sense anything. From this, we can assume that the Bonesea is almost ready too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became serious after stating this. In fact, he himself was an incredible being. Alas, even if he was stronger, he was nothing before the Bonesea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. In my opinion, it’s just a step away.” Li Qiye slowly said: “When I seized the Trident, the Bonesea was still able to show restraint. There is a great saying: a little impatience spoils the great plan. Even losing the trident is considered a trivial and endurable matter, so what is it planning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones was gripped by this speculation. He had spent a long time in the Bonesea and many generations in this place. He understood the implications behind all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This won’t just be a generation but an entire eon.” Li Qiye took another sip: “When it actually comes... I don’t know about others, but you will definitely be able to see that day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t have that much time left.” Bones forced a smile.</span></p>

It must have had a breakthrough for the initiation, but who knows if it will be the Bonesea, the Maelstrom, or the Divine Tree Ridge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones fell into deep thought. Regardless of his wish, that day was inevitable. However, to be able to see its arrival could either be good or bad for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you worried about?” Li Qiye smiled: “I don’t even need to see your treasures to know how much you have harvested this time. To be a bit harsh, you better work harder with all of these things to get a chance to leave this place. That is when the sky will open its doors for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe.” Bones murmured and sighed: “Leaving here will definitely be nice. No, abandoning this damned place is better than anything else, there’s no need to be anxious all day long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to leave?” Li Qiye smiled while looking at him.</span></p>

Am I suitable to run errands for you?”</span></p>

Without taking into account whether you can leave or not, even if you could, you still wouldn’t be able to drop everything. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones turned silent. At his level, very few could talk to him on even footing. Li Qiye was naturally one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones wryly smiled: “Right… am I willing to leave? After being tricked by the brat, my biggest dream was to leave this hell hole! Alas, I have been here for so long that I don’t know where else I can go. Even though this place has all sorts of annoyances, I still kinda like it! Perhaps it is because I was born here that I am destined to take root here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The place that gives me life and raised me!” Li Qiye emotionally sighed as well: “Indeed, many people love this place with all their heart. Countless unfathomable characters knew that a disaster would come one day to Heaven Spirit, yet they still chose to take root here! This is a profound love for this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bones smiled and commented: “Maybe I will die in this damned place one day. Being born and buried in the same location isn’t such a miserable fate.” It looked like he has accepted his fate.</span></p>

There is still hope in this world due to the numerous wise sages that took root here. Both treefathers and sea gods have yet to give up. They have tried their best, but since that day still hasn’t come, the world has yet to see their efforts.”</span></p>

There are a few things that no one really wants, but they have no choice other than to make a decision. This is true for these great existences. Despite making concessions, they still tried regardless of success. Some of them didn’t give up on this world and their children.”</span></p>

You have to start somewhere to build a castle from sand; this is not a bad start. If, one day, the world finally knows the truth, they might not sympathize with a few concessions. However, this is quite normal. After all, for generations, not anyone could go all out regardless of the cost. There are things in life that hold people back, forcing them to stop no matter what.” He sighed at this point.</span></p>

In his mind, anyone with the tiniest trace of sensibility would decide to run away as far as possible. However, some things couldn’t be decided by reason. Was he willing to leave this land? It would be full of reluctance since he loved it! Li Qiye didn’t force him to do anything and simply told him the news. In the past, he really would run away given the opportunity, but now, he wavered with hesitation.</span></p>

It might be a little crowded, but the possibility was there. Land was worth as much as gold, so a place this large should have been lively and bustling with people everywhere. However, this was far from the truth. The population here was so scarce that it was pitiful. One could go for thousands of miles without seeing a single soul!</span></p>

Some said that there were devils living here. Others believed that this place shortened people’s lives, and the life expectancy here was much shorter. Another belief was that this place was suppressed and not suitable for living beings. Perhaps there were other unknown reasons as well.</span></p>

The moment he stepped inside, he suddenly felt a boundless atmosphere suppressing him.</span></p>

However, it would be mistaken to think that this land was barren. In fact, it wasn’t desolate or barren at all. On the contrary, this vast place had treasures everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>

It seemed that since the beginning of time, Godhalt had never experienced destruction or development before; it has stayed the same all this time. This was a feeling unique to this place. Other locations might have the same vast aura with dense worldly energy, but it was different from Godhalt’s primordial sensation.</span></p>

This was a common belief across Heaven Spirit, but even those who chose to take root here would have to leave eventually. Even Immortal Emperors wouldn’t want to establish their sect here outside of one exception, Immortal Emperor Bu Si.</span></p>

A force of suppression existed. Anyone who came would be subjected to this. A paragon visiting Godhalt would be dropped down to Heavenly King or an even weaker cultivation.</span></p>

For example, in the Jade Sea, one could take ten years to cultivate one level, but it would require several decades or even centuries to replicate this task on Godhalt.</span></p>

Unfortunately, it isn’t your turn to have it. We can take a step back and say you all take root here. One day, after growing to an unmatched level, you will find that all of this would have only been benefiting someone else… This place already has a master.”</span></p>

What is special about this one?” The influential characters didn’t understand why the fairy chose to come out. One of them said: “First Meng Zhentian and now Lunargrasp. Will more Era Evaders come out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It makes sense why Zhentian came out. He only appeared during Immortal Emperor Ta Kong’s era, so he wants the Heaven’s Will this time. It’s different for the fairy though. I simply don’t understand it. She has been away from the world for a long time but she came out without any prior signs.” Someone was quite puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Lunargrasp Fairy isn’t considered an Era Evader, she is just more reclusive in nature. If she was an evader, she would have come out long ago for the Heaven’s Will since no one would be able to stop her. So why this generation? I don’t understand at all!” An elderly ancestor with great knowledge was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of these sealed ancestors realized that there must be a reason, and it wasn’t the Heaven’s Will. The secret in this matter was completely unknown, others couldn’t figure it out at all.</span></p>

Zhentian coming out has already left us in despair, but the Lunargrasp Fairy too? Should we just go kill ourselves?” Young geniuses cried to the sky after hearing this news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the fairy came out for the Heaven’s Will, who will be unbeatable and become the next emperor? Zhentian or the Lunargrasp Fairy?” Some grew excited and began to speculate.</span></p>

It won’t be easy for him at all with her around. I’m sure he won’t be sleeping too soundly from now on.” Others gloated about Zhentian’s misfortune.</span></p>

They shook their heads and lamented: “If Lunargrasp is out for the throne, Zhentian won’t be able to do anything. Even Emperor Assailants aren’t willing to oppose her! Her old rival was Empress Hongtian!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The storm of her coming raged across Heaven Spirit, resulting in an uproar with countless people discussing this matter.</span></p>

In the end, he came out early and ordered: “Prepare some gifts for a trip to Godhalt. It is time for us to visit the Spirit Abyss.”</span></p>

He was still walking through Godhalt one step at a time as if he was enjoying the beauty of this continent.</span></p>

It was Sima Yujian, the famous assassin. She appeared out of nowhere and showed her bloodthirst. She was still as calm as ever with an aura that made others shudder uncontrollably in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glanced at her and flatly said: “So? Still haven’t given up? I spared your life last time for a reason, but I won’t be so merciful this time around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She glared at him and coldly said: “I’m not here because of you!

However, after arriving, she found Li Qiye here. An assassin shouldn’t have a curious mind, and she was indifferent to everything else besides killing. Alas, his sudden entrance piqued her interest so she couldn’t help but follow and find out what he was up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After the failure last time, I thought you would be in closed cultivation. I didn’t expect for you to run out again.” Li Qiye smiled.</span></p>

Ever since embarking on this journey, she had never answered anyone. Nevertheless, she committed a taboo of the assassination doctrine. Not only did she track him for no reason, she also chose to answer him. In fact, there were some questions looming in her mind. However, due to her proud personality and occupation, she wouldn’t ask Li Qiye for advice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye nodded: “That’s true. An assassin should accumulate experience from a baptism of blood and death in order to improve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he looked at her and smiled: “Since you are here to train, who is your target if not me? Who is paying the high price?”</span></p>

He smiled and said: “If I wanted to, I can find the answer even if you don’t tell me. It all depends on my whim.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such words made Yujian raise her eyes. She didn’t doubt Li Qiye’s abilities. In fact, she was fully aware of his superiority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Spirit Abyss!” In the end, she finally revealed her goal.</span></p>

Your dao of assassination hasn’t reached perfection just yet. If you were qualified to have the Coiling Dragon Sword, then I’m sure you would succeed even if the target is inside the Spirit Abyss. But you right now? You are only going to meet your demise, there is zero chance of success. The abyss is not only strong, it also makes it so that you will have nowhere to hide. A single misstep and you will certainly end up dead!”</span></p>

What are the rules of an assassin? The first is to stay alive, the second is to complete the mission. Only by staying alive would you be able to complete your mission.”</span></p>

For example, knowing the target’s identity, strength, habits, weaknesses, and so on and so forth… By knowing the enemy, you will emerge victorious one hundred times in one hundred battles. It is meaningless to sacrifice oneself to complete a mission. That would render you a puppet, a tool for murder. You would be unable to go further on the dao of assassination…”</span></p>

It is not only about killing the target regardless of the price. The most important aspect about this dao is whether the user can carry out the overall strategy while evaluating whether it is worth doing. This is the rule of the Godslaying Night Corps and the reason for its glorious exploits!”</span></p>

Not only was this person familiar with assassins, the scary part was him revealing her lineage! In Heaven Spirit, no one knew their name anymore! Li Qiye’s knowledge has shaken her completely.</span></p>

I don’t know who is in charge of the corps right now either, but your information regarding the abyss is lacking. Entering it means that you can easily expose your whereabouts. Assassinating their members in their home isn’t wise either. This abyss holds unbelievable power in Godhalt, outsiders simply can’t understand this.” Li Qiye well-meaningly advised her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stared at him coldly and left without saying anything.

Like you said, I am your husband, so do you think I will plot against you? I can do whatever I want already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah! Bah!” Xiaoxiao spoke with disdain: “Don’t daydream so much, who would want to marry you? Please, I don’t like you at all. I’m only doing this to make Jianshi and the others mad. Hmph, trying to steal my man? Don’t even think about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite her tender age, this little girl had a fiery temper and would dare to back her words up in a lawless manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good, that’s good. I’m really lucky that we aren’t married.” Li Qiye acted completely relieved while patting his chest: “I would be incredibly miserable if you kept on crying and begging. Aizz, look at you, no figure at all and no hint of gentleness. As for the allure of a woman... where? If I marry such a deficient girl, the remaining half of my life would be very sad.”</span></p>

She rushed over and arched her slightly visible cleavage while glaring at him.</span></p>

Please, I am the prettiest girl in the Jade Sea and loved by the people. Even flowers bloom at my sight…” She was speaking while poking his chest. Her hot temperament was made clear as day from the first glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was that Ye Xiaoxiao was indeed very pretty. Even though calling her the number one beauty in the Jade Sea might be an exaggeration, she still grew up quite well with a pair of clear, moist eyes and a flawless nose. Her young age didn’t prevent a valley forming between her breasts. No matter how one looked at it, she was an incredible looker and enough to be praised as kingdom-toppling even if she wasn’t going to be the most beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye didn’t mind her outburst and rubbed his chin while quipping: “I’m a person who likes girls with big breasts. Of course, a gentle nature is a win as well.”</span></p>

Pervert! Watch how I’ll deal with you to rid the world of your evil!” The livid girl turned red and unleashed a barrage of punches and kicks at him. She detested hearing people talk about her modest chest the most.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should I tell you?” She gave him an annoyed side-glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nevermind, I don’t want to know anyway.” Li Qiye shrugged with a smile.</span></p>

Sure enough, I found that there are many interesting things here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye joked: “Are you sure you didn’t get lost and run to the wrong place?”</span></p>

You’re the one who’s lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye guessed correctly. Xiaoxiao heard that the Bonesea was very lively, so she initially ran there to play. Alas, she didn’t expect to enter the wrong coordinates into the portal so she was directly teleported to Godhalt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t seem to mind going to the wrong place and decided to have her fun on this continent by robbing people. Many cultivators fell victim to her, especially the disciples from the Spirit Abyss.</span></p>

Didn’t you go show off at the Dragon Demon Sea? I heard you were being accompanied by beauties all day long, why willingly run to Godhalt, a place where even birds don’t want to lay eggs at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Jealous?” He leisurely looked at her and grinned.</span></p>

Is a treasure about to appear at Godhalt? I heard there were some at the Bonesea too, did you obtain any?” She unleashed a barrage of questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First of all, my name is not ‘ey’.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and replied: “I suppose I don’t mind you calling me husband since I’ve been dabbling in romance recently. Letting you have this honor is still acceptable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bah, have you no shame?” She stomped on his foot before changing her mood right away with a coquettish blink: “I won’t call you ‘ey’ from now on. You will be Ego King instead since all you do is act all domineering and narcissistic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye chuckled. He didn’t mind what Xiaoxiao addressed him with since he only wanted to tease her.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You find it particularly fun because you aren’t being suppressed.” He commented with a smile after noticing her expressive demeanor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know!” She was shaken and looked at him in astonishment.</span></p>

In your mind, you can even defeat a Godking in Godhalt. How does it feel being the king of bandits?” He amusingly stared at the startled girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him up and down before skeptically asking: “You weren’t spying on me, right?”</span></p>

Everyone said that outsiders would be suppressed on this continent, but she was completely untouched. Moreover, she was even able to summon extremely magical and powerful trees that she couldn’t in the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After discovering this secret, Xiaoxiao grew quite excited and stayed behind to be a robber since she felt that no one here could be stronger than her.</span></p>

Just like that, she became addicted to this lifestyle and didn’t even spare the disciples from the Spirit Abyss.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Calculate? This is something that relates to my bloodline and you know about it for sure, that’s why you were able to figure this out.” She gave him a nasty look.</span></p>

However, he agreed in his mind. This was indeed related to her bloodline that contained a great secret.</span></p>

The Golden Isle had two treefathers, so they understood their race very well. Alas, even the most knowledgeable ancestors failed to figure out her bloodline.</span></p>

There, you might be able to comprehend the mysteries of your bloodline to its full extent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She remained skeptical: “Really?”</span></p>

Newcomers would come to find that the vast aura of Godhalt came from the Divine Tree Ridge. This aura was as boundless as an ocean. More importantly, an abundance of lifeforce could be found here. People would feel as if they were bathing in its energy at any corner of the ridge, resulting in an indescribably pleasant sensation.</span></p>

Such a spectacular scene was out of this world and could only be found at the Divine Tree Ridge. Any cultivator who comes here would be astounded by this sight.</span></p>

Of course, there were numerous speculations. One stated that the ridge itself was created by the fusion of a gigantic tree and the earth which resulted in this magical scene.</span></p>

Their version was that in an untraceable era, there was a war between immortals. In the great firmament, an immortal uprooted one mountain range after another and used them as spears against his enemies! From then on, these peaks were pinned into this place. Either way, it was impossible to draw an exact conclusion since no one could give a definitive answer.</span></p>

It was a fair-sized village with only around one hundred people. Smoke from cooking pots was flying with chickens and dogs making their noises — a life of simplicity. Such an ordinary village could be found everywhere in Heaven Spirit.</span></p>

Thus, this was their world! As for the reason why they were spared from the suppression, this remained a secret even until now. The Spirit Abyss would never tell an outsider. One could only speculate that this might have something to do with their bloodline.</span></p>

If it isn’t a very dangerous location, then one will only turn into withered after death. However, if it is indeed a dangerous place, then this might not necessarily be the case. For example, if you are slightly injured and your blood drips onto a seed, then this seed will begin a hunt as if it was your shadow. It could dig into your forehead at any moment and turn you into a withered.</span></p>

A tree is still only a tree in the end. In a stricter sense, it can’t be considered a creature. At the very least, it can’t have intelligence like us.

A human has three souls and seven spirits by nature, such a thing can’t be taken over on a whim. Because of this, do you still think a seed can truly take over a body? They must kill the host.

The first generation might be able to ignite their own life force, but in the end, they still can’t escape their shell that was initially a corpse. In a sense, they are still dead or someone on the verge of death. Such a status renders it nearly impossible to give birth to a new life. This probability is low enough to be ignored completely and, given the circumstances, the second generation won’t be an intelligent being.

However, they are very powerful. Meeting them will put you in great peril. Remember, they do not have intelligence and are just moving corpses.”</span></p>

It means that they will have their own soul — this is the biggest difference between them and their parents! The second generation is probably the first form of a race. Of course, all of the prerequisites must be met.”</span></p>

Of course not.” Li Qiye smilingly said: “Think about it, with just some seeds and corpses, how could they survive for thousands of years? They aren’t just parasites in host bodies. To a large extent, they still rely on their origin. If they leave this place, they wouldn’t be able to survive for long or pass down their offspring.”</span></p>

Of course, not all of them can inherit these things, and even if they do, it would only be a fragment of the whole.”</span></p>

It was difficult to imagine that these withered used to be corpses. They didn’t look much different from the other races since they also had emotions. It was a bizarre and very frightening spectacle!</span></p>

In my eyes, a remarkable improvement has been made in the last one or two generations.” Li Qiye smiled and explained: “Look, the village head’s soul clearly grew all the way to every part of the body from instinct. Meanwhile, this new withered is different. Even though it is still trying to grow to the rest of the body, it is mainly situated in the brain, very similar to our three souls and seven spirits.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength of their former bodies isn’t why they’re scary. Them being able to rely on the ridge itself is the most powerful force.” Li Qiye flatly responded: “In fact, the withered aren’t evil, they just want to survive. Even though they don’t mingle with other creatures and even deny cultivators from integrating with them, they do not attack people under ordinary circumstances. The scary beings are the treecorpses. They are even stronger than the withered and have greater numbers as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Treecorpses? Aren’t they the offspring of the withered? How come this failed generation doesn’t live together with their parents?” She was a bit stunned.</span></p>

The dead and the near-dead won’t live together, so the treecorpses stay together far away from the withered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She asked: “How come we haven’t seen any yet?”</span></p>

If you go close to them, they will attack you first.”</span></p>

Li Qiye seemed to be measuring the area during the trip. What was even stranger was that he looked to be refining this place. Each of his steps aimed to leave behind an imprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also took his time observing every village and town that had the withered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After having to stop by each village and city, she eventually asked: “Ego King, why are you researching? What is your goal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What goal? I’m just researching.” Li Qiye casually smiled: “In fact, the withered are great references. From nothing to something, they are seeds that will give birth to a race. Even though they have all kinds of deficiencies and shortcomings, there is a lot of value in studying them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And then?” She was still puzzled. In fact, most cultivators wouldn’t care about this issue even if they knew that the withered started from seedlings. The majority of them would worry about how to obtain treasures or how to cultivate certain merit laws. Thus, who would care about this trivial matter of the withered and their origin?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s nothing.” Li Qiye smiled: “Just an interesting and valuable reference for the start of a race. What experience they need, how to change — this information is all priceless. They start by borrowing a body, so there is a huge issue right away. However, after transforming and changing, they become something unimaginable. Such a shift requires millions of years that cannot be exchanged.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became solemn as he went on: “Humans and treants don’t have the same strange origin as the withered. After all, the withered weren’t blessed by the heavens like the other races, especially the charming spirits. The other races were born and relied on the world. In contrast, the withered are not protected by the world and not loved, so they have no choice but to be born with this strange method. Nevertheless, from birth to forming groups — a gradual process of becoming a race, this is all interesting and worth exploring.” He sighed at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It sounds like you are trying to create a race.” Her demeanor shifted while looking at him.</span></p>

Like Li Qiye had said in the past, creating life is the business of the high heavens!</span></p>

Not even Immortal Emperors have accomplished this.</span></p>

As a frog at the bottom of a well, I want to understand what the damned heavens is thinking by exploring the creation of the withered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such casual words would cause others to be astonished.

This has exceeded their scope of comprehension. Only characters that have reached the emperor level would ponder about this issue.</span></p>

An ultimate state of indifference is nothing pleasant. However, some tasks need to be explored and accomplished in the end.” No one could see through Li Qiye’s unfathomable eyes at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many towns and villages along the way. However, they were antagonistic towards outsiders and refused to allow any integration. Of course, there were exceptions, such as the Divine Tree Citadel! This city accepted everyone, even outsiders. It permitted all-inclusive trading as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, this was the largest establishment of the withered and one of the largest cities in all of Godhalt.</span></p>

If one could see the city with their own eyes, they would definitely be shocked by the spectacle. This place had two mountains pierced into the earth and crossed each other all the way to the sky. The city itself was built in this intersection by the withered, so it was hanging spectacularly in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaoxiao grew excited at the sight of the city and cultivators coming and going: “So the Divine Tree Citadel is built here. I had always thought that it would be on the ground.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye smiled and brought her to climb along the mountain range. There were a few withered heading for the city along the way as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao asked Li Qiye: “Why do the withered here interact with outsiders and even trade with them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until now, she had always asked Li Qiye whenever a question came up. She found that he knew much more than the ancestors of her sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled: “This is a process that a race must go through to advance from a low to high-level civilization. Village to town to a great city... For these withered, the small villages are for recently transformed withered. Once they are independent, they can head to a town or even a big city like this one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can one become a true race without trading and interacting with others? For example, even if they could stay independent like the charming spirit and human sects, they would still choose to communicate with others. This is a necessity in order to grow stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She nodded repeatedly while listening to Li Qiye. After all, she was still too young and, despite her vast knowledge, she couldn’t grasp all of it and the topic he was commenting on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, they arrived outside of the city gates. There was a great tree protecting this citadel. It towered all the way into the sky with four extremely old roots supporting the base. Each root guarded one of the entrances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looking upward, an old face could be seen on the tree. It looked very benevolent and had a long, gray beard. Its features were friendly just like a neighboring grandpa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, its eyes were closed as if sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She felt inquisitive and asked: “What is that? Another withered?”</span></p>

It can be said to be a withered but also something else entirely. It is the city lord of this place as well as the divine guardian of the withered.” He smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They have a divine guardian too?” She was surprised by this revelation.</span></p>

The other withered all transformed from corpses. Before becoming a divine guardian, it was already famous and was referred to by others as the Terminus Divine Ancestor. Its prestige once deterred the rest of the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Terminus Divine Ancestor!” Despite not knowing this withered ahead, she was all-too-familiar with the name Terminus after hearing it many times in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She asked with astonishment: “Isn’t this one of the most powerful geniuses during the generation of the Golden Bamboo Ancestor?”</span></p>

Since she grew up in the Golden Isle, she had heard of the progenitor’s tales, hence her familiarity with the name Terminus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, that’s the Terminus Divine Ancestor, your progenitor’s rival.” Li Qiye smiled: “After failing to become a treefather, he voluntarily merged with a seed here at the ridge. The most incredible part of this whole thing was that he stayed alive after fusing with one. Ultimately, he took root here and became the guardian of the withered and this city!”</span></p>

As for the feeling? It feels pretty good, like leaves returning to the earth. People will have to die in the end, but as for where and how... the choice is different for each individual.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you chose to stay in this place?” Xiaoxiao curiously perused the ancestor. For treants, only the treefathers would be able to take root in the earth. However, Terminus’ current status was quite strange. He accomplished this magical task without being a treefather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Despite being a famous character, he was still talkative like an old man: “There is nothing bad about this place.

She then showed a fiery glare while placing both hands on her slender waist and said: “Ego King, did you do something bad again? Hmph! You must have done something behind my back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye only leisurely responded: “Something bad?

Earlier, he clearly wanted to tell me about a place, but now he’s all quiet. Who else but you could have caused the mischief? Tell the truth right now, what are you trying to do?” She gave him an ugly stare. Despite her young age, she was far from being stupid and understood that there was a reason for the sudden change in Terminus’ attitude.</span></p>

Who is the Terminus Divine Ancestor? He took root here and isn’t afraid of anyone, will he actually change his tone just because of a junior like me? I can’t believe that you are suspecting a kind-hearted man like me, is there no justice in this world?”</span></p>

This was a horrifying secret only privy to characters of his level. The more one was exposed to this type of secret, the more they understood about the inviolable taboo of this world. Because of this, despite knowing full well of her great bloodline, he still didn’t dare to teach her!</span></p>

Although the Divine Tree Ridge was one of the twelve burial grounds, it wasn’t a threat to everyone. A few people would consider these burial grounds to be a treasure trove.

She looked around constantly and found that this city hanging in the sky wasn’t much different from the other cities in Heaven Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the buildings and mansions here weren’t exquisite, they were much better than the rough structures back at the villages.</span></p>

They lived ordinary lives in this city. However, the withered here were actually very skilled at conducting business. One wouldn’t be able to tell that they were a new race at all compared to the other races.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The withered at the Divine Tree Citadel seem much smarter than the ones back at the villages. They can do anything.” Xiaoxiao carefully observed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their speech was also excellent relative to the other races. The duo had been to many villages before, but the withered there simply didn’t speak. Even if they could, only simple sentences came out. The ones here spoke in a very pleasant manner without any impediment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye answered: “It’s pretty normal. The rebirth and transformation require some time for adaptation, and how long depends on the individual’s talents. For example, when we are born, none of us could talk. The next development is a personal one based on the latent potential which could yield different results.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They casually strolled through the many stores at the citadel. The owners were all withered selling all types of goods. The most common commodities were spirit pills and grasses.</span></p>

Is it because the Divine Tree Ridge has them in abundance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s one of the reasons.” He smiled: “There is another one, the withered are gifted at finding these materials — quite an extraordinary talent indeed. Moreover, there are also many treecorpses here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do the treecorpses have to do with this?” She was puzzled.</span></p>

Their numbers are often proportionate, so that’s why there are corpse nests and lairs around here.” He paused a moment before continuing: “Despite the treecorpses being failed creations, the withered are still their parents so they can easily find these treecorpses. From this, it is easy to understand why the withered can also find alchemy ingredients at the ridge better than anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s the case.” It dawned on Xiaoxiao right away after hearing the explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, alchemy ingredients weren’t the only items for trade at the citadel. Some withered even sold weapons, but they were in the minority.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s hard to say.” Li Qiye understood why she thought so: “In fact, each generation, these withered are improving themselves, so the question regarding cultivation is still quite mystifying. They transformed by borrowing someone else’s corpse, so the seals and traces of their host are still there. For example, they can remember a few merit laws and techniques.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued the explanation as they walked around the different shops: “These merit laws are collected in different manners. Some are from old memories so despite the quantity, most are imperfect and incomplete. They might be useful for the withered, but if cultivators try to train with them, it will inadvertently lead to qi deviation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao was slightly dazzled by how big the citadel was. She found it much more interesting than the other places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Li Qiye and Xiaoxiao weren’t the only two cultivators present in the city, there were other cultivators around. Some came from the Spirit Abyss while others from all other the world. There was no lack of experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside of coming to satiate their curiosity, they also wanted to buy some alchemy ingredients. As a burial ground, the ridge was full of medicines and grasses. Some even believed that this place had immortal medicines. Without a doubt, the market for alchemy was among the best across all of Heaven Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the withered weren’t especially powerful and lacked resources compared to imperial lineages and sea god inheritances, no one dared to cause trouble in the citadel. Everyone obeyed the rules for trading.</span></p>

To cause trouble here was equivalent to courting death. It was such an unwise move that even the Spirit Abyss would behave despite being able to do whatever they wanted in the rest of Godhalt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye purposefully observed the city. Because of this, they didn’t only wander around but also looked for a place to stay so that he could peruse the withered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, across the long years, whenever he came to Heaven Spirit, he would visit the Divine Tree Ridge in order to make a comprehensive record of his analysis. He found them worth researching, unlike the other cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, creation was a matter left for the high heavens, but due to all sorts of reasons, the Divine Tree Ridge caused a new race to come into being. Even though this race had all kinds of flaws and wasn’t protected by the heaven and earth like humans or charming spirits, they continued to live on and have survived for generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So far, they still haven’t fully developed a third generation withered and couldn’t escape the constraints of their bloodline, thus being unable to leave the ridge. However, in each of his records, Li Qiye found immense changes with an inclination towards improvement. With ample time, a third generation would eventually appear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On that monumental day, an entirely new race would be born. They would no longer be withered but something entirely new that wouldn’t be inferior to the other races. It was completely unfathomable that something like this could happen without the involvement of the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, these records of the withered would help Li Qiye understand the mysteries of life. Moreover, he knew one more thing. If the third generation could successfully appear, a shift will occur within the ridge that shatters the balance of Heaven Spirit, helping it gain an advantage over the Maelstrom and the Bonesea!</span></p>

It was quite deep with old vines and pillaring trees resulting in a verdant scene. No one had a panoramic view of the valley due to the abundance of vegetation blocking their sight.</span></p>

The majority had human forms with some wooden parts. Of course, there was a clear distinction. A treecorpse’s wooden parts were natural unlike the withered that have undergone a change from flesh to wood.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing in terms of appearance.” Li Qiye answered: “Treecorpses might be dead, but from another perspective, they aren’t really corpses. Their bodies still have a hint of life in them. Of course, it is easy to distinguish a second generation withered and a treecorpse. Look at their eyes, the ones without life belong to the treecorpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his reminder, she carefully looked and found that the eyes of the treecorpses were different. They were hollow as if nothing was there; a pair of eyes engulfed by death energy. Logically speaking, only corpses would have this type of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She murmured while watching: “They don’t have a soul!”</span></p>

After all, the probability of meeting one was exceeding low in the Divine Tree Ridge. Moreover, rumor has it that these second generation withered were heavily protected, so outsiders couldn’t see them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, they don’t have a soul.” Li Qiye nodded: “People say that the eyes are windows to the mind. One just needs to look at the eyes to see if a soul is present. For example, why is it that animated skeletons have red eyes? That’s their soul flame. Treecorpses might have a body that isn’t too different from the other races. The issue is that they do not have souls. Without souls, there is no need to talk about bloodlines and reproduction, they are only moving corpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had to ask: “Why are they born with a body but no soul?”</span></p>

These first generation withered are born from corpses due to the seeds taking root in the brain that eventually turns into a soul. Despite possessing this type of soul, they still can’t be considered a complete form of life, they’re merely a near-dead existence. Because of this, the odds of producing offspring with souls are negligible.”</span></p>

It made it clear just how difficult it was to start a new race.</span></p>

It is impossible to create life just by creating a body. Like many cultivators, a body can be rebuilt, but if the true fate is destroyed, that will be certain death. One would have nothing without their true fate since it is impossible to rebuild because they’re not the heavens! There is no way to reshape the true fate because this is something that belongs to the realm of life creation.” Li Qiye had a rare, solemn expression.</span></p>

They are the favorite children of the Divine Tree Ridge and can take root anywhere here even without souls. They are infinitely connected to the ridge, so they can stay in their lair forever without coming out, unless someone attacks them. Once a lair is formed, the members could stay there until death. This is one of the reasons why lairs are so difficult to find. Under normal circumstances, treecorpses won’t leave their lairs unless the lairs are destroyed or are under heavy attack. But now, this many are coming to this valley — this is indeed a bit strange.” He began to speculate after seeing this.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye laughed and replied: “Don’t worry, even the most powerful seed wouldn’t dare to touch you since you have the supreme bloodline. You are completely untouchable at the Divine Tree Ridge. Your blood will absolutely crush them!”</span></p>

You surely know the answer, just tell me already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye only responded with a smile: “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you, but the time isn’t ripe. After a couple more days, I’ll take you to a place. At that time, you will find out your bloodline even if I don’t say anything. A few things can’t be expressed with words, you will need to feel it.” Having said that, he pointed at his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only with that will you be able to know what your bloodline is as well as its true mysteries. Otherwise, you won’t be able to understand what your bloodline is carrying even if I speak one thousand or ten thousand phrases. It is all useless.” He spoke with sincerity and didn’t lie to her at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, whatever.” She glared at him and stepped on his foot again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye cheerfully spoke: “Okay, little girl, get ready, we’re going in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he grabbed her tiny hand and rushed into the valley with incredible speed. The Soaring Immortal Physique had no equal in terms of speed. Even Xiaoxiao couldn’t react in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh! Buzz!” His intrusion was met with attacks from all the treecorpses. Some roots flew like arrows while others used their signature fire and ice elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye’s speed was countless times faster than them as he invaded the valley. Not to mention harming him, they couldn’t even touch his sleeve. In one moment, Xiaoxiao could still see herself standing outside of the valley, but in the next, the scene changed completely. It only took the blink of an eye due to a speed that surpassed time and everything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep in the valley was a small flat ground with a boulder in the middle surrounded by many treecorpses. The ones that were able to sit here were clearly older than the other corpses and much more powerful as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more than ten of them sitting near this seemingly common stone that looked like a table in this flat area. Perhaps the treecorpses didn’t know what a table was and used this boulder as one by chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was quite strange. They weren’t protecting any alchemy ingredients at all. Judging by their expressions, this seemed to be a debate. This was quite an unbelievable scene because they didn’t have souls or intelligence and only relied on their instinct the majority of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, this looked like a high-level meeting as well. Even Li Qiye found this surprising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While looking at the dozen corpses, Xiaoxiao curiously asked: “What are they doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked as well and murmured: “Until now, I have only been researching with a great emphasis on the withered while overlooking the treecorpses. Along the years, they have undergone changes as well and have obtained a certain level of intelligence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene made one thing clear, the treecorpses weren’t soulless creatures like before. Regardless of what this meeting was about, they have evolved as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Until now, Li Qiye thought that only the withered had a chance to become a new race. His research was lacking for the treecorpses because of their inferior characteristics. A soulless creature had no chance to develop intelligence. In terms of turning into a new race, the withered were a hundred times more likely compared to these corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his study, if the second generation withered can’t successfully produce a third generation, they wouldn’t be able to become a new race. If that was the case, it was simply impossible for these corpses. The dead can’t become a new race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, this scene took him by surprise. He didn’t expect for some corpses to have a little intelligence. Although it looked quite limited, this was still a good start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpses stood up and stared at the intruding duo. Li Qiye noticed and smiled: “A bit interesting, do you want to fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were far stronger than the ones outside. Moreover, the rest of the corpses surrounded this area completely and seemed to be ready to pounce at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone else would be scared out of their minds under this perilous situation. However, Li Qiye was still calm and could speak normally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short amount of time, countless gazes were on them. Xiaoxiao felt a bit frightened from all the unwanted attention. This wasn’t due to her being timid, it was because this scene was too bizarre and creepy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was one thing to be stared at by the living, but staring at her were countless eyes from the dead. It was a completely different sensation. Their hollow eyes carried a ghastly energy. There was nothing but death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Right when Xiaoxiao thought that these corpses were about to attack them, they dug into the ground and disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong with them?” She found this astonishing and didn’t know why they didn’t attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They fled.” He chuckled and walked towards the boulder that they were sitting around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fled?” This took her by surprise: “Why did they flee? Are they afraid of us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she felt that this wasn’t plausible since they attacked all the other cultivators that entered the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soulless they might be, their instincts are quite keen. They know who they can and can’t mess with.” Li Qiye understood what she was thinking and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was suddenly attracted by something on the boulder and carefully observed it as if it was a supreme artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?” She found it strange to see his focus and quickly looked over as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing on the boulder outside of a few shallow traces. These traces had been carved by a small stone. Moreover, they were quite new, so it was apparent that the corpses from earlier drew them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was completely indiscernible and abstract. They weren’t dao runes or magical runes and were very few in number as if the corpses just drew them randomly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaoxiao failed to understand them while Li Qiye relished this moment as if it was an earth-shattering mystery. He circled around the boulder, seemingly turning a deaf ear to Xiaoxiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She found his current expression incredible. These faint marks were nothing, a drawing from a child would be much more interesting in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just what is it?” After a good while, she couldn’t help but ask again while Li Qiye was still immersed in his observation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He eventually regained his wits. However, he didn’t turn his gaze away from the marks as he replied: “They’re writings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Writings? The corpses’ writings?” She was a bit startled to hear this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can put it that way.” He continued to study them carefully: “In fact, it is still a bit early to call them text. However, in addition to instinctive expressions, these corpses have another way of communicating. These words are still very simplistic. This is only the inception and it still hasn’t fully formed yet, but maybe a real system will come out from this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The withered also had writings. However, their system came from the other races in the nine worlds. They studied and used the common texts like the others. Alas, it was different for the treecorpses. They started from scratch, and so did this particular writing system. These shallow markings on the rock were the corpses trying to express something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is written here?” She simply couldn’t decipher the intent.</span></p>

This type of text is still in its early stages, it’s not even finished yet. I’m afraid no one can truly understand what they are trying to say.”</span></p>

No matter what, they are evolving and showing great improvements outside of their innate skills, such as this type of text. It looks like the stronger ones have a better chance of changing. Hmm, I might have been neglecting them all along.”</span></p>

Surely, the treecorpses were the ones who made these items.</span></p>

Despite the simplistic and rugged nature of these items, they were still the culmination of the treecorpses’ effort.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wondered: “What are they going to do with these things? Will they be using them?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A new life? What kind of life? Another generation of treecorpses? Can they actually reproduce?” Xiaoxiao was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that the withered could give birth. However, this remained a mystery for the treecorpses since they were only failed products.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe.” Li Qiye pondered a bit: “This world has too many unimaginable things, even the villainous heavens can’t expect everything. Maybe this is the earth-shattering event that they were alluding to. After all, a new life is about to be born!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of life will the next generation of treecorpses be? How does it compare to the withered?” She took a deep breath and murmured: “Didn’t you say the dead can’t reproduce? The withered are already near-dead and can barely produce life. Moreover, their second generations are mostly failures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the villainous heavens can miscalculate sometimes. The world is just full of surprises, if the dead can actually reproduce…” Li Qiye turned quiet again.</span></p>

Even after this much time passed, these tales went on about how this race was produced by the dead! Therefore, if a completely new life can come from the treecorpses, it would be a monumental change and an unfathomable development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpses brought along all kinds of items to the deepest region of the valley where there was nothing other than a cliff.</span></p>

Any spectator would think that they were going to collide with the cliff, but in reality, they all disappeared inside.</span></p>

In principle, only these moving corpses can enter this particular world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A world where only the dead can enter?” Xiaoxiao was surprised: “Then why don’t they just stay there if there is such a world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not as simple as you think. You can’t just stay there on your whim, it is an inner world.” He shook his head in response.</span></p>

The other one was the Spirit Abyss. It would be inconceivable for this to happen on any other continent.</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, this person fell down from the sky and landed right in front of Li Qiye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who?!” Xiaoxiao was startled and shouted.</span></p>

Normally, her expression would be cold and emotionless like ice itself. However, the paleness this time was due to her injuries and a considerable loss of blood, making her unstable condition clear. She must have sacrificed some longevity blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was also covered in blood. Who knows if it was her own or her enemies’?</span></p>

After seeing Li Qiye, her mouth slightly opened as if wanting to say something, but no words came out. She wanted to walk away, but her steady pace nearly made her fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately helped her and pressed his palm to her head to pour an endless amount of blood energy into her.

Moreover, they didn’t try to hide their power at all and let their blood energy soar to the sky in an overbearing manner. They looked as if they could do whatever they wanted with wanton regard for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their leader was an old man with an even more terrifying blood energy.

They even looked ready to attack at any moment without caring about who Li Qiye was. Just the slightest sign of disobedience would prompt them to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where are you going to run to now?” The leading old man stared at Sima Yujian and sneered.</span></p>

Not to mention the fact that he wouldn’t let anything happen to Yujian, even if he didn’t know her, he would meddle anyway just because of the old man’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After recognizing the group based on their clothing, Ye Xiaoxiao told Li Qiye: “They’re from the Spirit Abyss.”</span></p>

She had prepared sufficiently this time around. Even though her cultivation had been suppressed, she thought that success was still within reach. Alas, she underestimated the abyss. Like Li Qiye had mentioned before, there was no stealth play in that location. Even the escaping art she was most proud of had lost its power.</span></p>

Nevertheless, she was still a fierce assassin; with her plethora of techniques and traps, she managed to kill her way out. However, there was no way of running out of Godhalt due to her grievous injuries. In this helpless situation, she thought about Li Qiye and used the blood he left behind in order to find him!</span></p>

It is no longer up to you at Godhalt. I’ll let you think about meddling in other people’s business once I break your legs and make you kneel on the ground!”</span></p>

It’s too bad that this isn’t any other location in Heaven Spirit. I don’t care who you are. At Godhalt, even dragons have to coil before us and tigers must lie down obediently or else we’ll break their tendons and take their marrow!”</span></p>

Not even in his wildest dreams would he expect for something like this to happen. It was simply impossible. Without the abyss’ help, everyone would be suppressed by Godhalt. Immortal Emperors were exceptions, of course. However, Li Qiye definitely didn’t get any help from the Spirit Abyss yet he was doing just fine — simply inconceivable.</span></p>

Actually, your coven of bastards isn’t even qualified to do so.”</span></p>

However, he had seen more than enough in the past, some even more beautiful and seductive than Yujian. Thus, she was only average in his eyes.</span></p>

She was puzzled as well. As an assassin, she never paid attention to her own appearance. However, she felt a sense of loss, a sense of defeat after being stared at by Li Qiye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite not caring, she was still a supreme beauty after all and could definitely be placed among the top ten in Heaven Spirit. However, he only gave her a nonchalant glance when she was standing naked before him as if she was no different from all the other existences in the world, as if she was another trifling and common spectacle. In any case, she felt a bit frustrated. It was more difficult to calm down from this compared to the failed assassination earlier.</span></p>

After a while, strands of light rose from the water. To be more exact, these strands seemed to be crumbling. They had been hiding in her body, and the cauldron’s fire finally expelled them.</span></p>

At this time, these meticulous lines dragged out an item from her body. This was a tiny dao rune that was locked by the fiery lines so it couldn’t move at all.</span></p>

She had been struck by someone’s dao rune without noticing at all!</span></p>

Without the abyss’ permission, this light left an indelible mark on you. Because of this, you can’t hide there. It didn’t matter what kind of techniques you employed, they could see you clearly.”</span></p>

The radiance of spring filled the room. The water beads dripping down from her white breasts were too temptatious.</span></p>

She wanted to say thanks, but the words wouldn’t come out. This was her nature, and the path of an assassin had only amplified it. The words “thank you” were too difficult to say since self-reliance was her way of life.</span></p>

Her emotions rarely swayed due to being an assassin. However, after hearing this, she felt an urge to beat Li Qiye up. It could be said that this man was really asking for it by saying such words.</span></p>

At Godhalt, there are secrets and rules to follow. Why is it that so many people come to the abyss for help after arriving here? It is because they can undo this suppression. However, unlike me, they rely on treasures to do so.”</span></p>

Godhalt has obscured some mysteries, so as long as you understand them, you can undo the suppression.”</span></p>

It gave a piercing feeling and made others not want to go near her. Li Qiye looked at her and said: “Even though I won’t accept a disciple, from today on, you will follow me so that I can teach you the Godslaying Dao!”</span></p>

Too slow! You think I want to bring an unwanted stepchild everywhere? Your dao is only at this level, yet you dare to come to the abyss for a mission? Don’t smear the reputation of the Godslaying Night Corps! To let someone as weak as you inherit the corps’ ultimate techniques is an affront to its prestige!”</span></p>

Moreover, the Coiling Dragon Sword would be in your possession. Even though you were selected as the successor, you are not at the level to wield the sword, the weapon that represents the supreme prestige of the Godslaying Dao!”</span></p>

If I wanted to see your memories, there is no escaping since you can’t resist me. Besides, if I want the merit laws and secrets of the night corps, I wouldn’t need to use you either since your knowledge is too limited! As long as I give the command, your masters would tell me everything!”</span></p>

She felt as if he was the king of the night, the ruler of darkness. He possessed a charisma that she had no answer for. In fact, she was strong enough to resist even a Godking. Unfortunately for her, she had met Li Qiye. He could be considered the creator of the Godslaying Dao, the unquestionable lord of the Godslaying Night Corps, its real master.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye plainly said: “Welcome back. This is the real Godslaying Dao. Your previous perception of assassins was misguided. They are not just killing machines without emotions or feelings. It looks like the person who taught you the dao had a slanted understanding of it. Your comprehension of this dao was stopped at a relatively shallow level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at him in fear. After hearing his statement, she suddenly realized something. A light flashed in her eyes and gave her a warm feeling. Countless feelings raged in her heart as if she had returned to the past. Her sealed heart had it layers unwrapped one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sima Yujian and Bai Jianzhen were different. Jianzhen started on the ultimate heartless sword dao at a young age. Because of this, her coldness was a murderous sword dao formed in a natural manner.</span></p>

Arrogance and pride were present, but she wasn’t this cold and heartless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after losing to the Swiftdao God in the competition for the sect master’s position, her fate changed as she embarked on the path of the Godslaying Dao. This changed her from a pampered daughter to an assassin. During her training, she was as cold as ice like the sword in her hand. She became a weapon destined to kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she felt a return to the olden days. Her heart was jumping as if she was no longer an assassin!</span></p>

He was too familiar with this process and gently shook his head: “This is something everyone needs to experience. In the beginning, many will think that the Godslaying Dao is an art of subterfuge, a ruthless weapon for killing. However, even a tool for killing doesn’t need to be cold and emotionless. An assassin is primarily himself and then a weapon. If you aren’t even a person, how can you achieve a grand dao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to speak, but silence was the better answer.</span></p>

However, this created some erroneous interpretations for many people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know where the problem lies?” He continued in a serious tone: “It is not about removing emotional fluctuations completely. Think of it as cultivation. Is your dao heart so easily shaken? With a strong dao heart, your will will be as firm as a rock. However, this doesn’t mean that you are an emotionless weapon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She listened attentively to his preaching.</span></p>

As an assassin, you can consider yourself a monarch drifting through the night. However, just because you lurk in the shadows doesn’t mean you are darkness. You are searching for your own light in the darkness, or perhaps even the light of this world.”</span></p>

As the successor of the Godslaying Dao, what is your light? Is it only to kill?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian couldn’t formulate an answer.</span></p>

In the beginning, she chose this path in order to reach the apex and overtake her brother. She wanted to prove that she could be stronger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the further she went, the more confused she became because the Godslaying Dao seemed to be different from her pursuit. They were two completely different paths!</span></p>

If you don’t think this through, you will never be able to surpass this inner demon and will never be able to control the Coiling Dragon Sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…” Countless words ran through her mind, yet she didn’t know where to start and became even less articulate.</span></p>

I can only say that he is a responsible master, not a good one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yujian immediately retorted with a cold tone: “I won’t let you say so!” She had the utmost respect for her master because when her life hit rock bottom, he was the one who pulled her back up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am simply telling you the truth.” Li Qiye flatly said: “The Godslaying Dao is not a merit law or an assassination art. It is a grand dao at heart, and a supreme one at that. Otherwise, why would dao be part of its name? Might as well name it 3,860 killing techniques then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something he rarely did — carefully imparting his knowledge to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye explained: “The most important thing to start the path towards a grand dao is to have a dao heart, and an inquisitive one at that. A dao heart is essential before obtaining a grand dao. If you consider yourself a weapon of murder, an emotionless sword, then you won’t even have a heart, let alone being able to seek the dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When people say that the grand dao is heartless, it doesn’t mean that the seekers should be heartless as well, that’s just the nature of the grand dao itself. On the godslaying path, both murdering people and hunting beasts, traps and skills, all of this for the Godslaying Dao is only a means towards sharpening oneself so that the user can go further and further before reaching the apex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In fact, becoming an assassin is no different from cultivation. As you grow stronger, you can kill those even stronger than you, or you can use your assassination arts to achieve your objectives. This is simply a process for you to become a supreme expert and not something as superficial as a weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s like practicing an ice technique. Once successful, you can freeze the eight directions and imprison myriad realms. Then does that mean the goal of this particular path is to become an ice woman? No, that’s not the case. It is so that the user can become an Immortal Emperor or another expert standing at the pinnacle. This is a true grand dao. If this isn’t your aspiration in your training, then it would just be learning techniques and tricks, and those alone will never allow you to reach the peak!” He wholeheartedly preached about the grand dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no thoughts about taking in a disciple. However, Yujian was indeed gifted in this particular aspect while he had always worried about the Godslaying Night Corps. Thus, his patience today was to repay the night corps and to fulfill one of his own wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye finished with a serious expression: “Thus, if you want to surpass yourself and reach the peak of the Godslaying Dao, you first need to stop being an emotionless weapon. Second, you’re not on this path only to surpass your junior brother. You need to treat it as a supreme grand dao, something worth pondering. This is how you will cultivate yourself to the apex!”</span></p>

She stood there with one hand on her chin, completely immersed and fascinated by his words. She calmed down at the same time as Yujian and ran over to tap on Li Qiye’s shoulder: “Ego King, were you an assassin in the past?”</span></p>

It was not unreasonable for her to think this way. Even Yujian was suspecting that Li Qiye might be from the night corps or a supreme assassin that they secretly groomed.</span></p>

I am me, Li Qiye, that’s all.”</span></p>

However, during the emperor’s era, the gate was very prestigious while the abyss was the underdog. It was a time when experts coming to Godhalt would also visit the Undying Gate to show their respect instead of just the abyss. Alas, this was no longer the case.</span></p>

Some supremes believed that the abyss had some incredible treasures on top of their bloodline. Because they claimed to have the oldest bloodline of the charming spirits, they were unhindered by Godhalt. However, it was a different story for the Undying Gate. No one knew why this particular sect was fine.</span></p>

The emperor back then realized this, that is why he built the Undying Gate here. At Godhalt, there are two supreme places to establish sects, both taken by the abyss and the gate. These locations are supreme treasure lands. This is why the emperor was so great. He struggled for a long time in order to find many secrets of the ridge and established his sect here.”</span></p>

 <p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1">[1] The raw saying for this is a modified version of a common phrase — you can’t say that just because you haven’t eaten pigs means that you have never seen one run. The meaning is that you don’t have to actually do something to understand or comment on it. For example, spectators can comment on sports without being a professional athlete. A more modern yet childish and fitting line would be — just because I’m a virgin doesn’t mean I haven’t seen a girl before. A more formal version would be — I’m not a complete neophyte.</span></p>

I can’t believe you are actually gracing us with your presence today, what an honor for our sect and this lowly one.”</span></p>

The gate master was afraid of being implicated by Li Qiye’s presence, but he was still a member of the human race and desired for Li Qiye to be the next emperor.

Despite its majestic appearance, the gate itself was in a state of disrepair. Many mountains were broken as if people had excavated this land to pieces.

Even the mountain ranges and buildings left intact were declining from many years of neglect while showing signs of collapse, evident by the weeds everywhere.</span></p>

If some powerful cultivators and sects didn’t wish to pay, the Undying Gate couldn’t do anything about it. However, the truly powerful wouldn’t mind paying such a little amount of money. After all, they were all people with great statuses and could afford the meager sum of some refined jades.</span></p>

If the Undying Gate doesn’t provoke a truly powerful enemy, it won’t be that easy for it to be destroyed completely. After all, it still has some secret powers left, so experts will find it difficult to obliterate it in full. Even a monstrous Godking wouldn’t be so idle as to do something like destroying the Undying Gate.”</span></p>

If we had an artifact that relates to immortality, it would have been taken away long ago.”</span></p>

After all, how could this sect hide anything from those powerful existences, especially the emperors?</span></p>

Back then, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou had checked all of our secrets and guaranteed that we do not have an art of immortality.”</span></p>

Many desired this mythical art, and some wouldn’t mind destroying the gate for it.</span></p>

During this perilous time, the Undying Gate invited the emperor to preside over the situation. In the end, he publicly presented a message to the world.</span></p>

After the emperor went through every single one, he truly didn’t find anything of the sort. In fact, the sect didn’t try to hide it at all, not to mention that it would be useless trying to trick an emperor in the first place. Because of his guarantee, these rumors quieted down for a good while.</span></p>

We really don’t have an art of immortality.”</span></p>

Fortunately, invincible existences like emperors wouldn’t steal their techniques for they would look down on such despicable actions.</span></p>

People keep saying that your sect does have such an art, so either Immortal Emperor Bu Si didn’t pass it down or you have lost the inheritance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would doubt Immortal Emperor Wu Gou’s words. Even though some secretly believed that the sect had such a method or was once in possession of it, one thing was certain at the very least — the world indeed had a supreme technique for immortality.</span></p>

Immortal Emperor Bu Si had died time and time again, but he was still able to revive — this was the best evidence. However, after the emperor, no one else from the Undying Gate had been able to replicate this deed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, some people speculated that the emperor never passed down this art or the gate might have lost it. From then on, this technique was no more.</span></p>

Such a thing was tempting, but it could bring about a total catastrophe.</span></p>

She looked at the mountain ranges crossing the sky and said: “Even if your sect doesn’t have this art, it isn’t being suppressed by Godhalt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the second thing from the gate that was so desirable by others. Only the abyss and the gate were spared from this fate. The abyss’ case was a bit more clear cut while the gate’s reason remained a secret. A few believed that it was due to their art of immortality, but the most common speculation was that they had a treasure just like the abyss. However, no one has been able to find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The master smiled awkwardly before having no choice but to say something: “Well… Princess Ye, you might not be aware, but it isn’t the same as before. In the distant past, we were indeed freed from the suppression, but there are limitations now. Inside the Undying Gate, we are completely fine, but our disciples are will be suppressed in the other parts of Godhalt.”</span></p>

A lot of people have tested this and we don’t need to lie about it. In addition to this, although we might not be suppressed in our sect, our cultivation speed is much slower compared to the past. We really don’t have any treasures since it would have been taken by the emperors already.”</span></p>

A long time ago, our disciples were indeed fine in all of Godhalt. Later on, the suppression gradually affected us. Nowadays, we are fine in our ancestral ground but not anywhere else. Moreover, our cultivation speed has slowed down. Who knows the specific cause?”</span></p>

However, if you say you don’t know why the suppression has begun for the rest of the continent, it would be too much of a lie.”</span></p>

Unfortunately, I am powerless.”</span></p>

This place is extraordinary because it is the beginning of the Divine Tree Ridge.” He withdrew his gaze and continued: “How is it special? Your progenitor has understood some mysteries of the ridge and made some transactions before establishing a grand plan with a supreme imperial foundation. This is why this ancestral ground is unaffected and why the Undying Gate has yet to be destroyed. Even if the other sects took over this area, their cultivation would slow down because they’re not the descendants of the Undying Gate!”</span></p>

There is only one reason for this. Moreover, you know this reason very well. There is a special worldly energy in this place, or at least there was in the past. Your emperor had gone inside and changed the Earth Vein in the inner world. He used a heaven-defying method to imprint his own lineage into this Earth Vein. This allowed for the disciples to gain access to a different worldly energy than everyone else. This is why the members of your sect aren’t suppressed in Godhalt.”</span></p>

Li Qiye was right, this secret was passed down for generations, and he was the only one who knew it in the present.

Although Immortal Emperor Bu Si had created a supreme imperial foundation, later on, your sect still tried to send disciples to build up more bases on the edges of the world. Alas, your sect is on the verge of death today.”</span></p>

This is the interesting part about Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Any other emperor wouldn’t have this fate with the area. As for sea gods and treefathers, there is even less of a chance. Not to mention that they can’t build a lineage in this place, very few sea gods and treefathers — without factoring in the Trident and ancestral weapons — could actually stand as equals with emperors. Without heaven-defying abilities, trying to change the Divine Tree Ridge is virtually impossible!” Li Qiye shook his head at this point.</span></p>

Treefathers and sea gods have stood shoulder to shoulder with emperors throughout the generations. Moreover, treefathers return to the earth after death.

Emperors have the Heaven’s Will — this isn’t something sea gods and treefathers can compare to. Even with the Trident and ancestral weapons, they can only keep the same pace as an emperor and do not have the ability to defeat them!”</span></p>

Below this land is a supreme imperial foundation laid out by Immortal Emperor Bu Si. Even if your sect has fallen, just by using the old source and this foundation will allow it to survive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Immortal Emperor Bu Si had performed an incredible technique in this place and refined an imperial foundation at the Earth Vein below the Undying Gate, fusing the two into one. This required painstaking efforts for him since he wanted a long-term strategy. Perhaps the Undying Gate would usher his reborn self. This was precisely the reason why future enemies found it prohibitively difficult to completely annihilate the Undying Gate.</span></p>

Even though the descendants have messed it up, it is possible to start over to regain the special worldly energy.”</span></p>

In order to have the same worldly energy, you must reconnect to the entire Earth Vein with the foundation in order to create a new pathway for gestation.”</span></p>

Not to mention their lack of power, even if they were strong enough, the mysteries left behind by their progenitor weren’t something juniors like them could understand.</span></p>

This all depends on the fortune of your sect. We will have to see if your progenitor’s remnant blessing can still help all of you.”</span></p>

If Bones doesn’t like you, he will crush you to death with one hand.”</span></p>

At this time, Li Qiye released the Myriad Age Tree and a newfound vitality oozed out like the source of life. Anyone standing next to the tree would feel as if they were dozens or even hundreds of years younger.</span></p>

The pits with dao runes made by Li Qiye had little shoots coming out. These were new lives that grew at an unbelievable speed.

It seemed that this formation connected to another world.</span></p>

It was granting the vines endless power and boundless life. It was as if under its empowerment, these vines could grow and blot out the sky in an instant. However, they chose not to do so and instead simply swam to the cliff by Crane Beak and continued to weave in the sky.</span></p>

Moreover, the little planks and wooden huts were moved to a corner of the valley here as well. They seemed to be building a fence for a courtyard inside.</span></p>

It was completely dead without a sliver of life. Judging from its characteristics, this was a female corpse. There was a protrusion on its belly that was big and round. Moreover, it was undulating as if something was inside.</span></p>

I thought treecorpses could only live for one generation, but this doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. They also have a chance to give birth to a completely new life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened here?” Many treecorpses had fallen around the dead female.

The huge belly shot out thick rays of lightning that instantly struck these four.</span></p>

This is a unique life form, a miracle. Its life began from the heaven and earth. If it could actually come out, this might be the start of an entirely new race.”</span></p>

When its mother was alive, she acted as the medium, allowing it to connect with the world. Alas, she is now dead, so it is trapped inside its mother’s body and severed from the world. If this continues, it will die for sure.”</span></p>

Without its mother’s protection, it is a frightened little beast that will attack anyone who comes close.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do then?

Letting it come out is not hard, but you don’t know what it will bring to the world, especially for treants like you. It can result in an unimaginable consequence. If you understand the implications within, from a selfish standpoint, I wouldn’t want this lifeform to be born in this world if I were you.”</span></p>

However, runes appeared on the pillar of life. Under their protection, it didn’t matter how terrorizing and powerful these bolts of lightning were. They couldn’t amount to anything nor were they capable of hurting Li Qiye due to the Ancient Void Rune being capable of devouring all lightning and curses.</span></p>

They gently patted it with their aura of life like the return of spring. Each gentle touch could melt snow. It was gentle and delicate with great vitality, calming down the restless lifeform inside. It was gradually becoming effective. The restless life calmed down and both the lightning and flames slowly dissipated.</span></p>

The buds have yet to open completely as they were tightly stuck together. Who knows what was actually wrapped inside? Each petal looked like the fat white skin that belongs to a baby. Moreover, it was pulsing as if it was breathing. One could also hear a thumping heartbeat. Even though it wasn’t very loud, people could hear it clearly.</span></p>

Perhaps it will be able to turn them into a new race.”</span></p>

An existence like this would need to gestate for another ten years or more. It only came into being now because there was no other choice, this is a premature birth. When it actually grows up, it won’t look like this.”</span></p>

However, this galaxy was simply too big, it would require many years before it could reach all the corners. Of course, since Li Qiye had told her so, she wasn’t in a hurry.

They didn’t enter just yet since the sky-blotting Terminus Ancestor opened his eyes.</span></p>

The path to the grand dao has been opened for you. In the future, the treants will shine because of you.”</span></p>

He was already a heaven-defying character, and he only grew stronger after taking root here.</span></p>

However, he held Xiaoxiao in a good light. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, he would have made her his disciple instantly and personally became her dao protector to watch her turn into an unstoppable treefather.</span></p>

He naturally knew who he was facing. Even if he wanted to, he lacked the ability.</span></p>

You can ask him about where the immortal medicine is and ask for his help to get it.”</span></p>

The nine worlds are only secular places, how could there be a medicine for eternal life? This only stemmed from some baseless and foolish rumors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There really isn’t a medicine for eternal life?” Xiaoxiao was curious about the topic since she had been hearing about it after coming to Godhalt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really.” Terminus shook his head again: “How could there be this level of medicine in the nine worlds? If it does exist, Immortal Emperors would have taken it away already, it wouldn’t be the turn of those foolish ones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao felt that Terminus didn’t need to lie to her.</span></p>

However, I personally know that there is an amazing divine medicine in the Divine Tree Ridge. Alas, my memories are still vague, I believe it might be at something something valley.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well…” Terminus let out a hollow laugh: “I don’t know much about this either because the Divine Tree Ridge is so large.”</span></p>

The land under my jurisdiction is also very little. The Divine Tree Ridge is one of the twelve burial grounds, and it is too mysterious. My foolish self can’t even grasp a tiny bit of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terminus spoke very modestly at this moment since he didn’t dare to show the slightest bit of arrogance in front of Li Qiye.

Li Qiye intended to find a place for the two girls to stay so that he could go and see someone. Before he could arrange for their accommodations, however, he was stopped along the way.</span></p>

He was quite handsome and gallant. It was clear that this was an incredible prodigy.</span></p>

Huang Yuxuan would be the person who receives all of these characters, so many have seen him before. Some even had ties with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the famous Li Qiye?” Yuxuan came forward and chillingly glared at Li Qiye, clearly showing his murderous intent.</span></p>

At Godhalt, who would dare to disobey their abyss? It didn’t matter who they might be back at their own regions, they had to ask the abyss for help in this place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, an outsider was acting so presumptuously that it fueled Yuxuan’s will to kill even more. This was a direct challenge to the abyss’ prestige.</span></p>

However, the rules cannot be bent! Godhalt has its own rules! Our abyss would welcome you as a guest at Godhalt. However, you came and protected an assassin who murdered our disciples, not to mention you killed more than ten yourself. You need to give us, and the deceased, an answer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t matter whether people knew him or not, they secretly praised his reasonable and graceful words. It didn’t tarnish the abyss’ reputation at all. Moreover, they glanced at each other and lamented. Li Qiye was indeed a fierce man, he would always kill wherever he went without scruples even if the opponent was from an imperial lineage or a sea god’s sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, at Godhalt, he even killed disciples from the Spirit Abyss. Many cultivators who came would always act sensibly towards the abyss. Even the most incredible genius wouldn’t oppose them. After all, even a strong dragon would have trouble against a local serpent.</span></p>

This was true to his overbearing nature. It was as if he didn’t need a reason to kill people and couldn’t care less if their sect came for retribution.</span></p>

He didn’t bother to explain himself and only showed a completely indifferent attitude. Fierce was indeed unique, he didn’t care for reasons! Yuxuan was livid because Li Qiye was showing utter disdain for their sect!</span></p>

If our disciples were wrong, then very well, we will swallow this anger. However, if you murdered the innocent, your own fellow cultivators, and protected the assassin…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The abyss had a reputation for being a bully at Godhalt. However, Yuxuan’s choice of words was very appropriate and level-headed. It was no wonder why he was chosen to be its successor, he was indeed capable of bearing this responsibility.</span></p>

I killed them, I don’t need a reason to do so. Speak if you have something to say or fart if you have gas. Even if you are here for revenge, just act quickly. I’m very busy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tides have completely reversed today.

First, hand over the assassin, second, confess your crime to our abyss. My seniors are currently staying at an inn in the citadel, so go there and surrender yourself. As long as you can do these two things, we will forego this grievance out of consideration for you being a top genius!”</span></p>

Not to mention killing their disciples, just offending them alone would end in your entire family being killed! Fierce’s momentum is unstoppable since he can slaughter anyone in his way. It is understandable that the abyss would choose to compromise.”</span></p>

I have already shown my mercy by not destroying your abyss. All of you should be going to bed with a beaming smile from being so lucky, yet you are here asking for me to surrender. Did your brains stop working?”</span></p>

Everyone here was completely tongue-tied. They all felt that after killing so many disciples, just apologizing to end things would still be quite an awe-inspiring tale for Li Qiye. Anyone else would have apologized already.</span></p>

An oath feud with the Spirit Abyss was no joke since this was a sect that would stay true to their word. One shouldn’t even dream about leaving Godhalt alive after receiving this declaration.</span></p>

Good, I got it. If there is nothing else, scram. Of course, come if you want to fight. I have other stuff to do after I kill you all.” Li Qiye spoke in a carefree manner.</span></p>

At this minute, it looked like Li Qiye viewed the abyss’ group as nobodies. It was as if he could kill them on a whim.</span></p>

Our abyss will not let this go.”</span></p>

Fierce is too monstrous. The wisest thing to do when you meet someone like him is to run instead of opposing him unless death is on your mind.” An expert who had seen Li Qiye in action before shook his head: “Alas, the abyss cannot let this go so Yuxuan can’t escape death. They can’t be blamed either due to their position as rulers of Godhalt.”</span></p>

Remember, the Dream Empyrean are the ones who can exert these reflections to their highest potential. They can even derive a divine beast out of it. Such an accomplishment is indeed amazing.” A sea demon spoke with a tinge of envy.</span></p>

The reason why they produced so many grand completion Immortal Physique users and physique laws was also due to their divine reflections.</span></p>

It could even be said that the various fists have been trained back to the level of their origin and have assumed the form of their Immortal Physiques. Even though these fists still had quite a gap compared to the actual physiques, their power was still quite unimaginable at this particular level.</span></p>

Even the paragons from the previous generation were horrified. Shortly afterward, they were certain that they wouldn’t be able to block a single move from Li Qiye. This disparity in strength had become too obvious and considerable. Many quietly retreated and stayed far away from Li Qiye. They simply didn’t dare to provoke Fierce.</span></p>

Even though they didn’t dare to express this publicly, they were feeling quite good inside. It was about time for someone to teach this overbearing sect a lesson.</span></p>

Of course, only those with great backgrounds were eligible for such treatment, such as ancestors from imperial lineages.</span></p>

However, at Godhalt, even a behemoth like the Ancestral Terra had to give the abyss some face. After all, the disciples of the Ancestral Terra were still suppressed by Godhalt. They needed the abyss’ help to lift this suppression.</span></p>

Those who enter Godhalt without visiting the abyss wouldn’t receive any help from them. Moreover, this sect would purposely cause trouble or even rob them. A common fate would be getting killed in order to keep this a secret. This was precisely why many cultivators went missing at Godhalt. Outside of the dangers looming on this continent, a considerable amount of outsiders were robbed and killed by the abyss. In fact, the majority of visitors were aware of this, but no one dared to expose it since they still needed the abyss’ assistance while visiting Godhalt.</span></p>

Last time, I didn’t completely suck that Terra King junior dry. Keep on provoking me and I’ll not only devour him, I’ll absorb your terra as well!

How hilarious, you actually wanted to use this power against me. Fine, this power belongs to the ridge, so I shall return it to the ridge. You think that burying babies in the ground and letting the ridge’s power incubate them is equivalent to controlling the ridge’s power? If it was this easy, the ridge wouldn’t be one of the twelve burial grounds.”</span></p>

It was as if he had turned into a statue.</span></p>

Eventually, at sunrise, a figure descended from the sky. She looked just like an immortal with a peerless bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She floated among the bustling wind with the sun and moon as her companions. Anyone would be intoxicated by her magnificent style. The seemingly petrified Li Qiye finally opened his eyes and looked at this woman.</span></p>

He carefully stared at her; it looked like the countless years did not leave their mark on her at all.</span></p>

There was no hatred or anger, only coldness. He felt a slight pain after seeing this gaze. In the past, this pair of eyes used to be charming and bright just like the stars. Alas, the eyes have become cold all because of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath and said: “I knew you would come.

It is time to end this instead of avoiding it like I always have. In the past, I felt that I would still have a chance to apologize, but it is different in this generation since I must go. Maybe I will never come back again…”</span></p>

This will be considered completing one of my wishes.”</span></p>

Nevertheless, she was still listening to him as if that was all she needed to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He calmly met her eyes and smiled: “The years haven't been easy. Maybe you will never forgive me, and I know I am unforgivable on this matter. However, I’ll still need to say goodbye to you in this generation. I don’t mind whatever choice you make, I just know what I need to do, to see you one last time since we might not be able to meet in the future ever again. And yes, I’m very happy and excited to see you at this moment.”</span></p>

It was just as cold as her eyes. She looked like she didn’t care that he was making physical contact.</span></p>

However, in this generation, I have no choice but to keep going straight. I have sworn to never falter and look back. This is who I am, my fate and my true pursuit!”</span></p>

Invincible in the nine heavens they might be, but some things are still unsurpassable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So many people wish for power, wish to become emperors.” He wryly smiled while staring at the sky: “But one day, even the strongest will start to think about how amazing it is to be a mortal. Their lives might be short, but at least they will still have a home at the end of the day!”</span></p>

Someone as evil as you will probably live for millions of years.”</span></p>

Yujian also smiled after seeing his safe return. As an assassin, her heart has turned cold like her blade. However, she was still quite anxious after he left, especially after hearing his final words. Her hanging heart was finally put down after seeing this; she felt an indescribable happiness.</span></p>

People knew that Zhentian had come to Godhalt for more than a month now, and they thought he would have left already.

Li Qiye is Zhentian’s rival for the Heaven’s Will as well as a mortal enemy of the abyss.

Li Qiye’s strength has reached an indecipherable level.</span></p>

Since he had time anyway, he smiled and recalled: “Back then, this Conch Overlord was only a prince. He felt that he could do whatever he wanted just because his father was a sea god. He had grown accustomed to this lawless lifestyle at Heaven Spirit. One day, he met Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng at the Mortal Emperor World, and his arrogant self offended the emperor.”</span></p>

Of course it is a true story.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “You shouldn’t underestimate Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng’s words. He is the only emperor in history to have twelve fate palaces as well as the only one undefeated throughout his life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But ultimately, they are just words. Plus, the overlord’s father is still a sea god.” Xiaoxiao didn’t buy it.</span></p>

If Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng wanted to kill his father, there would be no escaping death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moreover, it wasn’t just a simple sentence. His words were an unquestionable imperial order. It was a supreme law that branded itself on the overlord’s body.” Li Qiye chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I heard others say that this overlord had once been recognized by the Trident.” Xiaoxiao brought up another point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is also true. When his father was still a sea god, the prince has indeed used the Trident before. Not only did it not reject him, you can even say that it flourished under his control. Under the cover of his father’s shadow, he indeed had a big chance of becoming the next sea god. Unfortunately, he offended Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng. One simple sentence buried his life. Even his sea god father couldn’t do anything about it.” Li Qiye concluded with a faint smile.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng’s reputation is not embellished at all. When his supreme imperial order brands someone, there’s no removing it, ever.” Li Qiye said: “After that single phrase, the Trident abandoned the overlord and refused to come close! This meant that his dream of becoming a sea god was shattered.”</span></p>

It wasn’t until the Emperors Era did they rear their ugly heads, and even then, it was all done in secrecy. He snuck out once to become the dao protector of the young River Devourer Sea God. Alas, he didn’t last long and couldn’t bear the damage caused by the indelible mark, so he had to go back into hiding again.”</span></p>

What’s so special about the Conch Overlord? I’m sure he isn’t as strong. He might be a prince, but she is also a princess.”</span></p>

Moreover, her battle experience is rich as well. The overlord is no match for her in both experience and wisdom, but she won’t become a sea god. No, she will never become a sea god.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaoxiao curiously asked: “Why can’t she become one?” A daughter of a sea god should have a better chance to become one more than anyone else.</span></p>

A few old stories emerged in his mind again.</span></p>

Not only was she beautiful, there was a special aura about her, granting her a unique and charismatic temperament.</span></p>

Of course, this armor didn’t hide her curves. Her breathtaking figure was still outlined beneath the armor. Her huggable waist, full and round breasts, slender thighs… Just one glance was enough to see them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most attractive aspect about her wasn’t her appearance or her alluring figure, it was her temperament and aura. She exuded an air of the ocean. Looking at her was the same as looking at the blue sky and sea, making people feel quite pleasant and comfortable.</span></p>

This aura wasn’t one of peaceful waters and more like a torrential wave. She was the tsunami that would fight the heavens and assault the tall peaks, not gentle rippling waves.</span></p>

If the Hallowed Ancestor was willing to tell her, she wouldn’t be asking him right now. Even though he has told her many things, his mouth was tightly shut about this matter. Even a pavilion lord like her didn’t know the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She eventually asked: “May I ask when you will perform the life-replenishment for our Hallowed Ancestor?”</span></p>

I don’t know how strong that Seashield Prince is, but if he has that cowardly turtle protecting him, it might be difficult for you to become a sea god in this generation.”</span></p>

You just need more time to hone your skills, then you can fight the True Martial Goddess. However, time will not wait for you during the competition for the grand dao.”</span></p>

Despite her absolute confidence, she needed more time before being able to fight the other goddess in the future. Presently, she still lacked mastery and experience. Moreover, her opponent was someone who has been accepted by the Trident in the past. That particular gap couldn’t be made up in such a short amount of time.</span></p>

It was exactly as Li Qiye had said, Prime was the unsurpassable pinnacle of the pavilion and the sea demon race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Keep in mind that there were rumors that Prime could fight evenly against Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo even without using the Trident. It could be said that he had trained the seven styles to their ultimate form. Because of these wondrous achievements, he was considered the strongest sea god or even the greatest of them all in the eyes of the sea demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, the True Martial Sea God appeared and was an unparalleled prodigy with illustrious battle records. He even fought Immortal Emperor Min Ren to a draw. Nevertheless, his own race could only consider this achievement as being equal to Prime at best. Remember that Immortal Emperor Min Ren was the first emperor of the Emperors Era; he was the one who started this golden age.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, she asked: “Then how will you help me? You can’t possibly push me above the limit to become an even more amazing sea god, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I take action, there will no longer be any suspense in you becoming a sea god.” Li Qiye said: “I chose you not because you are Prime’s descendant, more importantly, you have enough confidence and a dao heart that is as unyielding as a rock. However, it will ultimately be up to you to surpass your progenitor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what’s the difference?” She was confused: “As long as people like the Conch Overlord don’t kill me, I can still claim the Trident. Plus, if the Hallowed Ancestor comes out, I won’t be afraid of these assassinations anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Li Qiye responded: “It looks like you don’t know a lot. The old man is really tight-lipped, he must be worrying right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please inform me then, Brother Li.” The princess slowly said this with sincerity since he has piqued her curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye asked: “Have you ever thought about why you sea demons can only become a sea god? Sharing the same sky of Heaven Spirit, why is it that you can’t become an Immortal Emperor like the charming spirits? Is it because they are the favored children of the heavens?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was startled after hearing this. In fact, she has indeed wondered about this problem before, but there was no answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye continued: “Have you ever wondered why sea gods require the acceptance of the Trident? Where did this weapon come from? Just what secret does it hold?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These rhetorical questions left her feeling a bit breathless.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will be too late after you become one.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Your progenitor had the same idea back then as well, unfortunately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stared at him as her heart began to beat faster and asked: “So our progenitor and even our other two sea gods have tried to find this secret?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye explained: “That’s right, they have searched for this answer. The truth is that many sea gods tried as well. There is a great secret within all of this. The old man knows about it, but you haven’t reached the level to know, so he will definitely not tell you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was digesting all of this information. Of course, she didn’t blame her ancestor since he was surely acting for her own sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe our pavilion has a solution to this!” She eventually said this due to her great trust in both her pavilion and forefathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is.” Li Qiye replied: “Just like how the old man’s solution is for you to marry me. After I become an Immortal Emperor and we come together, with my ancient bloodline, we will give birth to a strong offspring. The descendants will be able to sever the roots and will no longer be bound by the shackles of your bloodline.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fair face turned hot after hearing this. Their pavilion had discussed this already, and the Hallowed Ancestor himself went to talk to her. In fact, she has already agreed to this proposed marriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was different when it came from Li Qiye’s mouth. Even a straightforward girl like her felt a bit bashful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, what I’m referring to is different from your ancestors’ beliefs.” He smiled: “I can tell you a few things about the mysteries of the Trident and also teach you a way to suppress your blood. After becoming a sea god and grasping these methods, you will be very grateful to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Trident’s mysteries?” She slowly said: “I won’t deny that you are matchless and unfathomable. However, I don’t think you know as much about the Trident as our pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What she said was the truth and not something out of pride. Their pavilion had three sea gods, meaning they had control of the Trident for three generations. Their ancestors had studied this weapon very thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled and revealed: “I won’t deny that. Unfortunately, I can control the Trident even better than your pavilion. Believe it or not, even after you become a sea god, I can still forcefully take the Trident away from you and there’s nothing you can do about it. This is beyond just understanding the weapon and more to do with bloodlines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite their comprehensive research, even Prime was helpless in this matter due to many different reasons.</span></p>

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to create such a powerful imitation.</span></p>

More importantly, he has a supreme method of control in this matter. It wasn’t just due to his understanding of the weapon, it was also because he had completely researched the sea demons’ bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the goddess didn’t know how Li Qiye took hold of these secrets.</span></p>

There is no free lunch in this world; if you want something, you must pay for it.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye couldn’t help but reveal a leisurely smile: “You are underestimating me. Little girl, it seems like you don’t really know me. If I really wanted your seven styles, I wouldn’t need to perform a transaction with your pavilion. I can just go up there and seize them, it’s that simple. A while ago, the only reason why I even made this proposal was to give your ancestors some face. I do not want to make blood flow like rivers at the pavilion since it is still of some use to me.”</span></p>

In all of Heaven Spirit, how many people would dare to talk about making blood flow like a sea at their pavilion?</span></p>

With all of his past exploits, he was domineering to an unimaginable level. They were bloody and had shown the world his power. Because of this, everyone found it natural when he acted this aggressive and fierce.</span></p>

I will give you a chance to break through. Of course, the height that you reach in the future will depend on you. If you can’t reach that level, it will be very disappointing and due to my poor judgment. In the future, when you have the chance to see me again, it will be the time for you to pledge your allegiance, one that lasts a lifetime.”</span></p>

Anyone else would have called Li Qiye insane. After all, why would a sea god willingly work for anyone else? This was simply impossible.

If I didn’t care for your Heaven Spirit World, I wouldn’t have any need to see Prime and would just take away the seven styles, who cares about you sea demons! Alas, I am still giving you, the pavilion, and the sea demons a chance. I can only say that I am too merciful in this matter.”</span></p>

If you defeat me, you can regain your freedom. If you lose, the same conditions apply.”</span></p>

If he was actually plotting against her, he could have done so in a much easier manner. The marriage was already a foregone conclusion since she had already agreed to it. If he wanted to borrow her power, what was closer in this world than husband and wife? They just needed to perform the ceremony to become one. At that point, the pavilion would even use all of their strength to support him.</span></p>

Furthermore, he was giving her a chance to win her freedom. As a confident person, if she were to be defeated by him after becoming a sea god, there would be nothing else to say. Such a brilliant man would be worthy of becoming her leader!</span></p>

We have plenty of experts, you are simply suicidal for opposing us…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my eyes, the conch is indeed malleable mud. Your so-called experts are just weaklings. Oh right, you have that cowardly turtle, the Conch Overlord, as your backing. Good, if you can survive today, go back and tell him to crawl back into his shell and hide. If he dares to oppose me, I’ll cut his head off and make soup out of him!” Li Qiye glared at the prince.</span></p>

It was easy to envision him looking down on the prince. After all, his strength had been shown to everyone. Being able to contend against Zhentian showed that he could only be stronger than the prince.</span></p>

Keep in mind that the overlord was a divine prince, the son of a sea god and the strongest ancestor of the Roaring Conch. Who wouldn’t show him respect in all of Heaven Spirit? Even Zhentian would have to tread carefully in front of him while addressing him with honorifics.</span></p>

This domineering nature was beyond words.</span></p>

This allowed each of his techniques to have a world-destroying power. With the Grand Primordial Dao, all the mysteries of the world were in his grasp. At this moment, cultivation realms didn’t matter to him outside of trying to shoulder the Heaven’s Will.</span></p>

The space where Li Qiye stood suddenly turned into a terrifying furnace. Space itself melted like liquid and submerged Li Qiye inside.</span></p>

They will be unable to escape the fate of being refined.”</span></p>

She gently sighed after seeing this. There is always a higher mountain and a greater man. With someone like Li Qiye around, everyone else would be overshadowed. It didn’t matter how great of a genius they might be. In the end, all would become bones that paves the path for him to become emperor.</span></p>

As the descendant of an Immortal Emperor, her aura was dignified and stately. When she glared at him like this, there was a special style worthy of savoring.</span></p>

Before Li Qiye, she didn’t look like an imposing master at all.</span></p>

Despite being his master in name, Su Yonghuang had never taught him how to cultivate, it was only ever the other way around. Li Qiye was the one who took care and guided her, so it was no wonder why he would tease her and call her a master by luck.</span></p>

She found the remains of her ancestor, and according to his last words, she knew that this place had a peerless divine root. Moreover, she felt an ascending momentum coming from that place as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Li Qiye had warned her before, so she fortified her dao heart and didn’t infiltrate any further. After taking back the treasure from her clan, she immediately left.</span></p>

Who knows how he found this place or where he received the message that she had this map? Before she left the ridge, he ambushed her in order to take the diagram.</span></p>

They treated each other with sincerity, and she could give him her all. Li Qiye opened the box and an immortal light gushed out. He couldn’t help but sigh while looking at the treasure within. The past resurfaced in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, he felt that he still owed the ancestor of this clan. He was the one who dragged her into the mess and gave her a promise. On the path towards the dao, she had sacrificed a lot. She formulated plans for Immortal Emperor Min Ren while carrying out conquests all over the nine worlds on top of defensive campaigns…</span></p>

After this, the emperor stopped associating with him. The two of them parted unhappily; he had no choice but to enter an early hibernation.</span></p>

If he didn’t involve her in the changing world, she could have lived happily as a golden daughter or a carefree princess. An ordinary life of happiness and harmony with her own family…</span></p>

It was all gone now, who knows who was right and wrong? The emperor wasn’t necessarily wrong and he wasn’t necessarily right. The only one who was hurt in the end was a woman who had sacrificed too much!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a sad sentiment running through his mind, he handed back the treasure box to Yonghuang and said: “Your clan’s treasure has many incredible mysteries, so you should take your time learning them. Once you grasp its profundities, it will mean a lifetime of benefits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will.” She took a deep breath and solemnly nodded.</span></p>

Xiaoxiao immediately jumped up with her aggressive pose, arched out her breasts with a slightly visible valley, and fiercely exclaimed: “This lady treads the world and deters myriad realms, who dares to say that I’m underage?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at Xiaoxiao’s appearance.

A hot wave coursed through her body. Even a calm woman like her couldn’t help but slightly lower her head with an air of indescribable gentleness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clank!” The grand dao began to move with sonorous sounds.

Even though this suppression wouldn’t injure anyone, being here for so long gave people the feeling of being shackled. It was completely overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She felt quite comfortable as her energy billowed once more.

Being ambushed by him had enraged her. If it wasn’t for the suppression, she would have killed him already!</span></p>

He didn’t move very quickly. However, the world thumped with each of his steps. He was walking with a very particular cadence — neither fast nor slow.

However, it does seem a bit cruel to use millions of corpses to nourish a tree. Isn’t this situation just perfect? Since the Ancestral Terra wants to kill me, it will be natural for me to annihilate them completely.”</span></p>

However, she wasn’t amused at all when it came from Li Qiye and even felt a little creeped out. Sima Yujian, on the other hand, felt a bit sympathetic towards the Ancestral Terra. She realized that he had been staring at that sect as if it was prey. He was a hungry wolf exposing his frightening fangs while the Ancestral Terra was a fat sheep unaware of the danger.</span></p>

The vice ancestor from the treants, Meng Zhentian, the Conch Overlord, and the Prince of Darkness signed their names on the divine order earlier.

Even the True Martial Goddess and the Lunargrasp Fairy might participate, so it must be to deal with Li Qiye.”</span></p>

Right now, I think Zhentian will be the emperor candidate. As for the sea god candidates, it could be the Seven Martial Goddess, the Seashield Prince, or the True Martial Goddess. It is easier to decide the imperial candidate since the charming spirits want Zhentian. On the other hand, it is a lot more intense for the sea god position. The sea demons don’t want heavy losses during this competition.”</span></p>

 <p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1">[1] This is something that can be very frustrating about ED that isn’t found in other novels. I actually missed this the first time and had to go back and re-edit. There are two different types of seats found here, “king” and “emperor” thrones. In a normal novel, you can simply translate it as throne and it would be fine and dandy. In ED, if you don’t translate the normally unnecessary adjective, it will mess you up. Li Qiye’s chair has the word “emperor” while the other three chairs only had the word “king”. King = royal and Emperor = imperial. This is a very minor detail in Chinese. However, in order to keep this detail in English, it makes the translation sound worse, but the distinction is there. I wouldn’t do this in Spirit Vessel, but in ED, more often than not, I need to add the adjective beforehand even when it is just a normal word like “throne” or it’ll be messy; the cultivation realm is different. It does make ED a lot more wordy in comparison. All in all, the translation has been moving towards not translating superfluous words, but this does cause trouble at times versus translating each word true to the raw.</span></p>

Unfortunately, your eyes were there for no reason and actually offended Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng. His lone phrase robbed everything from you and turned you into a cowardly turtle!”</span></p>

  <p>1. In the past, emperors would give out honorary plaques for virtuous wives/widows with exemplary character or achievements. The most common one is having a husband who dies young in war yet not remarrying. One more is taking care of her children alone and they grow up to be exceptional people that contribute to the government. As for the second part, Zhentian = Heaven Suppression. <a href="#footnote-ref-7bc0"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>3. This is a problem with translating sometimes. When there is a tool for mass change in the website, I’ll have to change Heaven Protector City to Heaven Suppression City. This issue here is that the word 镇 has multiple meanings: press down, calm, subdue, suppress, guard, garrison, strategic (city). Without context, it can be a guessing game with words that have multiple meanings. In retrospect, I should have known that the Black Dragon King’s city was suppression instead of protector because I’ve read ahead. Why do I know that Meng Zhentian’s version is suppression and not protector? Because of the context; Heaven Suppression is a lot more arrogant which would prompt the Black Dragon King’s comment. If it was protector, it would still be grand but not overly cocky. <a href="#footnote-ref-0d77"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

Regardless of what happens against the fairy, the only person who would benefit from this was Li Qiye.</span></p>

After all, she had advantages far beyond her competitors, not to mention that she was on his side at the moment. Thus, this strange decision made everyone think that the Seven Martial Pavilion was also on his side.</span></p>

He was quite unhappy as well since he was one of the candidates to become the sea god this generation. Several behemoths in Heaven Spirit had made a deal. In particular, the sea demons had reached a consensus that if the True Martial Goddess had no objections, the Seashield Prince would have priority over the Seven Martial Goddess.</span></p>

But now, the True Martial Goddess’ open support immediately weakened the prince’s position. The Seven Martial Goddess’ status had been elevated. The island and the pavilion working together with a sea god’s daughter could definitely change the overall situation of the sea demon race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, as long as the pavilion said the word, many sea demon lineages would stand with them and this new alliance would completely suppress the conch’s prestige!

As top characters of their respective generations, all of Heaven Spirit was afraid of them. No one dared to act this presumptuously, but Li Qiye had done so time and time again. Even a mud Buddha would turn angry after so many transgressions.</span></p>

The last one was him having control over his own body. This time, the vice ancestor was in charge, so he had a portion of the vice ancestor’s power. However, this didn’t matter. The fairy’s attack still annihilated him. Unless the vice ancestor’s real body came, he simply wouldn’t be her match.</span></p>

The moment the prince put them on, his hands turned into the hands of a sea god. There was a lot of history behind these gloves. It was a proud creation of the Roaring Conch Sea God that accompanied him to many battles. Later on, he gave it to his son, the Conch Overlord.</span></p>

They were anxious to see who would win in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many here wished for the prince’s victory, especially the sea demon race. Li Qiye was already putting enough pressure on their prince. If he were to lose to another human, their race would be completely overwhelmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang stepped up and glanced around with her phoenix-like eyes. She was cold and proud without putting on airs. Nevertheless, her noble aura was still exuded. This wasn’t consciously done since it was her natural and flawless temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She coldly glanced at the prince before speaking: “Come.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of the magical properties of the Void Physique. It allowed for its user to be undetectable while being able to reach any location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At minor completion, their body could fuse with space. It could even be said that space became their body itself. Thus, they were omnipresent. Some people even said that Void Physique users were the most suitable to become assassins.</span></p>

When it was mere inches away from her throat, the surrounding space finally shook a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment of life and death, Su Yonghuang shouted and her Extreme Yang Physique erupted with its powerful sunfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!” The impossible happened. The fire wrapped around her body and stopped the ambushing ray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” This fire didn’t subside after the successful block. It was akin to thousands of volcanoes erupting at the same time. This power incinerated the space where the prince was hiding. A black hole appeared, so he couldn’t hide there any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, he was extremely fast and disappeared after his previous spatial location was ruined and entered another space.</span></p>

Clank! Clank!” Extreme Yang laws emerged from Su Yonghuang and turned into a suit of armor. Her noble aura was now even more heroic and valiant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” An endless amount of sunfire was still spewing from her body and ravaged the space around her.</span></p>

Under the destruction of her sunfire, even the void itself was being burned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pervasive fire wouldn’t stop. It could reach and engulf any spatial area with haste.</span></p>

One would find it prohibitively difficult to hide in the presence of this amazing power since space itself was being annihilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strangely enough, despite this havoc, the Seashield Prince was still nowhere to be found. It was as if he had evaporated from this world. Of course, the people here knew that he wasn’t dead just yet. They were only curious as to where he was hiding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some began to sweat for him. Where the heck could he be to hide from this raging sunfire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Yonghuang didn’t become careless. With her Extreme Yang armor, she simply let her flames destroy the world without giving the prince the slightest opening to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an Extreme Yang Physique user, she knew full well that as another of the twelve, the Void Physique’s profundities couldn’t be inferior to her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!” The space where she stood suddenly twisted and morphed into a sticky quagmire, making her quite sluggish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince suddenly appeared and seemed to have opened a spatial door to appear next to Yonghuang. He seemed to have isolated space itself so the fire couldn’t reach him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” He formed a divine mudra that came crashing down like a tidal wave. Its water engulfed the world as if the entire force of the Dragon Demon Sea was slamming straight onto Su Yonghuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This power subdued her sunfire and dimmed her armor which, in turn, made his mudra attack even more powerful as its water swept through her space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her fire only weakened for a short moment. The sunfire erupted again with loud explosions like iron chains locking down the area. Its power surged exponentially and the water immediately evaporated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though her space was being controlled so that she was sluggish and had a hard time fighting back, she didn’t use any merit laws or techniques. Erupting her vitality and the flames was her counter attack. The roars of fire dragons echoed as they split the earth and shattered his mudra seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the ferocious dragons came for him, he swiftly vanished again. These huge dragons searched around but couldn’t find any trace of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he emerged once more right behind Yonghuang for an ambush. The flames that were wrapped around her body instantly coiled around him in order to burn him to ashes. However, he was skillful and vanished again before being touched by the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several more rounds were exchanged. The prince’s attempts of ambushing Yonghuang ended in failure. However, by relying on his Void Physique and hiding in space, Yonghuang couldn’t do anything to him either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators watched with bated breaths. They didn’t only want to witness the victor of the duel, they also wanted to see which Immortal Physique was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle was completely even for a while. The two sides held back their killing moves while trying to find their opponent’s weakness before delivering a fatal attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Li Qiye simply smiled without giving Yonghuang any pointers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the physiques themselves, it was impossible to categorize them in order of strength. Each had their own advantages and disadvantages. Their users actually mattered more than the physiques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qiye naturally knew the weaknesses of the Void Physique, but he didn’t tell Yonghuang. He wanted her to learn about her physique’s shortcomings and advantages in battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this, the prince couldn’t last a single move against Li Qiye. It wasn’t only because Li Qiye was powerful and knew the Void Physique like the palm of his hand. The fact that he cultivated the Space Scripture played a great part to this. Thus, the Void Physique’s strong points were nullified by Li Qiye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this wasn’t the case for Yonghuang. She wasn’t well-versed in spatial manipulation. Because of this, despite clearly having the upper hand, she couldn’t do anything to the prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other real experts present, like the prince and Zhentian, also realized this. In terms of power and cultivation, Su Yonghuang had the obvious advantage. However, there was no way for her to suppress or kill the prince without understanding the weaknesses of the Void Physique.</span></p>

The prince couldn’t break through the dominating solar flames since he couldn’t withstand its heat. Meanwhile, the Void Physique allowed him to be completely undetectable, so Yonghuang couldn’t kill him either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the spectators now understood that Yonghuang was also unaffected by the suppression from Godhalt. A while ago, she was wounded by the prince due to this suppression, but without it, the prince had no advantage to speak of.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, Seashield was changing his strategy. After several unsuccessful ambushes, he has decided to refine space instead.</span></p>

At this moment, he was still nowhere to be seen, but the surrounding space turned into a furnace that began to burn with an invisible flame.</span></p>

The majority thought that the prince could decide the outcome of this battle with this move.</span></p>

The location where Yonghuang stood crazily shrunk. The large amount of sunfire was being compressed into the space around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, her flame was all-encompassing and devastated the void. But now, it was being pushed down by a powerful force and became a small fireball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fireball was wildly collapsing like a sun. One could easily imagine the power contained within. All of the melted space around it was also condensed into a tiny section. The collapsing of this sun also made the space around it shrink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Yonghuang’s chance to counterattack. The prince wanted to refine space while she was waiting for this moment in order to make the space inside collapse entirely.</span></p>

Space itself shattered into little pieces and left behind only black holes and indelible scars in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff!” Blood spurted out. The prince, who was refining space, was affected by this blast. He couldn’t suppress this space any longer. The explosion blew him outside, causing him to spew out blood as his body seemed to be crushed and battered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Before he had the time to stand, the broken fragments of space along with the refined fire instantly turned into a dao chapter. It diligently followed the prince and left behind a mark on his body that would last as long as the prince was still stained with the presence of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Void Physique specialized in hiding in space, so how could he not be touched by it?

The fragmented pieces of space had fused with her flames after the monstrous explosion and turned into this chapter. This made it impossible for the prince to escape from being marked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz!” Right when he was injured, he vanished again and hid in the void.</span></p>

With a loud bang, she raised her hand and a gigantic fire dragon roared. Next, a huge dragon claw slammed down and blotted out the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space shattered while the prince, who was in hiding, was blown away again. He spat out another mouthful of blood, but his speed was still fast enough to disappear once more after the initial contact.</span></p>

Bang! Bang!” The nearby space continued to be smashed. Regardless of how he tried to evade Yonghuang’s Extreme Yang Physique, the prince had nowhere to hide.</span></p>

The only way was for him to abandon this fight and run far away. Of course, Yonghuang wouldn’t be able to hold him back should he choose to do this. After all, she was no match for him with regard to spatial movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that she has found the flaws of the Void Physique.

However, due to the nature of its parts, it wasn’t easy for him to do so for this particular mark.</span></p>

Even though the Roaring Conch’s Void Physique had been improved and derived from two generations of sea gods and was heading towards perfection, it was inferior to the real deal from the scripture itself. This made it possible for Yonghuang to find its weakness during this battle. Thus, the prince could only await his death.</span></p>

All nine of them wore the sea god gloves that poured out an endless light, illuminating the sky. It looked like a storm of brilliant powder falling down.</span></p>

The True Martial Sea God had talked about this matter to him before. Even an existence like True Martial didn’t dare to say much about the dark hand; he would always have a wary expression when this existence was brought up.</span></p>

He was the supreme of the sea demon race, an existence praised to be on the same level as Prime. In the past, he fought evenly against Immortal Emperor Min Ren even without the Trident. Min Ren was no slouch either since he brought about the Emperors Era. From this, one could extrapolate just how strong True Martial was.</span></p>

It is possible to reach the end of the dao on this path to become an Immortal Emperor. An assassin isn’t doomed to a lightless fate or to walk on an evil and unorthodox path.</span></p>

After losing to the Swiftdao God, she had given up on becoming an Immortal Emperor. Moreover, she thought that an assassin would have no chance of becoming one. However, she gained something from his guidance; it was as if a great door has just been opened.</span></p>

Although she didn’t know what the relationship between him and the Godslaying Night Corps was, logically speaking, he should be a talent from there as well since he knew their dao so well. Alas, no matter how she looked at it, he didn’t look like one of them.</span></p>

Of course, he still wasn’t her senior or peer. It was a very vague relationship. Nevertheless, he still carefully taught her without any hidden motives. No one else would believe such a thing.</span></p>

He shook his head and tried his best to convince her: “Listen, your bloodline is the most precious in this world, so you should treasure it. Since it has just awakened, try your best to understand it completely instead of wasting this opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please, I am a genius that can easily understand its profundities.” She held her waist and fiercely stared at him a bit: “Oh, Ego King, seeing as how you want me to leave so quickly, are you up to something?”</span></p>

I got it, you two must have that type of relationship.” With that, she revealed a dubious smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yonghuang’s face turned red after hearing this, but she immediately regained her seriousness and said: “What nonsense are you saying?

You think I don’t understand this Ego King? Hmph, he is the biggest narcissist in the world and considers everyone else beneath him. In my opinion, if he wanted to eat you, he would definitely have his fill. Plus, for someone like him, so what if you are his master? He doesn’t follow any guidelines either and will do whatever he wants…”</span></p>

This is your time to understand your bloodline with an isolated cultivation. Moreover, the two ancestral trees there will help you. Others wouldn’t even be able to dream of such a divine opportunity.”</span></p>

Otherwise, you will waste your bloodline. If you don’t try your best now, your future will be bleak. Even your amazing blood will be reduced to something ordinary. The heavenly dao requires hard work, it doesn’t favor the lazy.”</span></p>

Once your bloodline reaches grand completion, maybe I’ll take you to an even more brilliant and magical place. If you are too weak at that time, I won’t bring a stepchild like you along.

Before the convention, many people speculated that even if the Lunargrasp Fairy didn’t support Zhentian, she would at least remain neutral towards Li Qiye due to being from different races. Therefore, this result went against everyone’s expectations!</span></p>

After several fruitless trips, he finally found the place with the final leaves. I’m sure he must have consulted you about this.”</span></p>

Not only sea gods, even emperors have searched for it. Some emperors were successful, but since it wasn’t ripe, it would have been meaningless to take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had to ask: “Can it really make people reincarnate and live again?”</span></p>

However, I have never obtained mature leaves before or I wouldn’t have been waiting for so long. From one of the tattered records, one leaf can indeed allow someone to reincarnate once. However, the chance is only around twenty percent — one in five. Failure would mean turning into ashes.”</span></p>

For example, the first one is twenty percent, the next one will be reduced by half, and so on and so forth. Of course, you can also test your luck and eat all nine at the same time. Maybe you’ll get lucky and be successful.”</span></p>

After following him for so long, she naturally knew what he was scheming. Zhentian and them aren’t the only victims to fall for this.

I’ve grown weary of living for so long, I just want to go all out in the end regardless of the outcome. In this generation, I’m not thinking about starting over after losing. At the very best, I might just leave some backup plans.”</span></p>

He wants the Heaven’s Will and is in an advantageous position at Heaven Spirit. If the Lunargrasp Fairy does not compete, he’ll be able to do whatever he wants without competition. However, he alone can’t go against the other geniuses in the nine worlds. After all, everyone has backings and powerful lineages…”</span></p>

Because of this, the geniuses aren’t the only ones fighting. They have ample resources and dao protectors to subdue their enemies. It doesn’t matter how strong Zhentian is, he still won’t be able to take care of the rest of the nine worlds. He needs an Emperor Assailant to protect him and preside over everything…”</span></p>

Even if such existences won’t fight for him on the battlefield, he still wants some of them to guard his base. Otherwise, if his base were to be attacked before the war even starts, he would be on the passive end right away. Of course, it isn’t that easy to invite them. Ordinary treasures can’t get into their eyes. These old men are most scared of death, so nothing is more tempting than an object of immortality.”</span></p>

Before, due to Li Qiye’s warning, she didn’t dare to venture further and left after finding her ancestor’s remains.</span></p>

Some sea gods have come in person in the past, but they couldn’t do anything because of it. If it wasn’t for the map left behind by Immortal Emperor Bu Si, you wouldn’t have been able to find this place either.” He glanced at her after saying this.</span></p>

To a smaller extent, the momentum is man-made, but due to the location blessed by the high heavens, you can also say that this momentum is a natural phenomenon.”</span></p>

As the master, she had nothing to teach him, but he instead had taught her many things. Their roles were completely reversed.</span></p>

In this location, there was a momentum untouchable by even emperors. Its master must have been quite mighty and frightening.</span></p>

Of course, even for them, this is only a backup plan. No one would use it unless there was no other way. People of this level wouldn’t gamble on a twenty percent chance.”</span></p>

Fiercest was strong indeed and enough to make others tremble timidly. However, if the Lunargrasp Fairy and the True Martial Goddess were here as well, no one could contest him for the medicine!</span></p>

Even if they were to face Li Qiye or Meng Zhentian, they would still risk it all and try to fight for the medicine. After all, nothing was more important and precious than living on.</span></p>

Moreover, a spirit energy enveloped the entire place without dissipating. A garden for meditation this was; many cultivators would be willing to stay here and train.</span></p>

These complex currents formed a water vein. Moreover, the water from each stream didn’t interfere with each other and flowed quietly. It made the valley seem like a water kingdom. Even the potholes were filled with water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the middle of such a valley situated an old tree whose branches twisted everywhere. Even though it wasn’t overly large, it was flourishing with green leaves. Its thick bark made its age apparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This tree was incredibly conspicuous in this valley as if it was absorbing the massive amount of energy in the valley in order to grow.</span></p>

This old tree is still very amazing, but the disparity between it and the nine leaves is considerable, they’re not on the same level at all. The little grass growing beneath this tree is the real Reincarnation Nine-Leaves. It is attached to this tree.” Li Qiye pointed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She followed his direction to take a gander. Below the numerous roots was a grass around one foot long. There were nine round leaves growing from it like little circles with thin teeth on the edges. Because of these sharp edges, it looked as if the leaves were rotating.</span></p>

It was because there was too much energy from the tree. Plus, there were many signs pointing to its great age. Even the most ignorant would know that this was a divine tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, the grass growing from the roots of this tree was extraordinary, but it was no match for the tree itself!</span></p>

In the beginning, all of her attention was fixated on the old tree that had experienced the vicissitudes of time. Despite not being an alchemist, she could still tell that moving this energy-rich tree into a sect would grant great benefits for the disciples there. This was precisely the reason why she didn’t notice the Reincarnation Nine-Leaves in the beginning.</span></p>

The longer she looked, the more extraordinary it seemed. The occasional glimmer from the leaves was wondrous like the stars themselves and full of life.</span></p>

They were very small and initially looked ordinary. However, they had withstood the test of time just like the tree’s roots. Upon closer inspection, these roots looked like the claws of a true dragon that were clutching at the old tree’s roots. This was why the grass was able to grow on the tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these claw-like roots were loosening their grasp and seemed to be separating from the other roots.</span></p>

In fact, its roots are linked to the entire ground below. When it is near maturity, its roots will shrink. After so many long years, the process came down to this final moment of convergence. When it truly ripens, it will fall off from the tree…”</span></p>

Uprooting it would be akin to overturning the entire Divine Tree Ridge. You have to wait until it matures before doing so. Otherwise, even if you are capable of this task, it would be the same as taking away a dried blade of grass.”</span></p>

He stood in a puddle with a black light lingering around him. However, with another buzz, he disappeared.</span></p>

The moment they set foot on its ground, the two also disappeared from sight with a buzz.</span></p>

It was better to hide in the back instead of rushing in. Perhaps they could take advantage of the situation and steal the tiger’s meal right in front of its jaws.</span></p>

  <p>1. Momentum is the same character for world/era/momentum/aura. In the initial context, it sounded like an aura, but it wasn’t the word for aura, so momentum was the right choice. Momentum still makes sense, but in this particular context, world is the apt choice. Just know the same word in Chinese has all of these English meanings. <a href="#footnote-ref-db1d"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

Because of this, Zhentian thought very highly of him and placed him as the commander of the Heaven Suppression Legion!</span></p>

This was completely different than the past when someone would scold him for being ignorant and arrogant. His actions right now only looked domineering to the crowd.</span></p>

With the spear in his hand, the general’s will to battle was monstrous; he was ready to fight against the rest of the world. Meanwhile, Li Qiye was nonchalant and relaxed, as if he could easily take down any powerful foe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere became tense with everyone holding their breaths. Many felt that Li Qiye could take down the white general instantly. However, they still wanted to see the fight. After all, the general was Zhentian’s disciple. He might not be as strong as Zhentian, but the disparity shouldn’t be too far. Thus, if Li Qiye killed the general, it would be a direct blow to Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Li, it is just a misunderstanding.” A voice came about during this tense moment.

He looked as if the dreadful Zhentian was no different from a random person walking on the streets.</span></p>

Everyone followed us here, so if they were to die because of us, I would feel very sorry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He spoke with such sincerity that some people were confused and couldn’t determine whether he was lying or not.

Let’s go, I want to take this immortal medicine then go back home for a nap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhentian hurriedly said: “Fellow Daoist Li, you need to reconsider. This place is filled with fatal dangers. You should wait for this ice source to dissipate before entering.”</span></p>

No one could see that these two were mortal enemies. In terms of logic, Li Qiye was Zhentian’s competitor for the Heaven’s Will. Thus, Li Qiye getting in trouble could only be good for Zhentian. So now, when Zhentian asked Li Qiye to not seek trouble, it seemed like an act of kindness. This began to convince the other cultivators nearby.</span></p>

They knew that this was a type of strategy to egg Li Qiye on. The more Zhentian talked like this, the more Li Qiye would want to take the risk and rush inside.</span></p>

Fierce might be powerful, but his scheming is still not a match for Zhentian.”</span></p>

She knew Li Qiye too well. Li Qiye enjoyed jumping into traps and trampling all over his opponent’s calculations when they were certain of victory. He enjoyed watching their despair.</span></p>

They wanted to see if Li Qiye could actually weather through the incoming peril. They didn’t miss a single beat as he slowly walked into the entrance while waiting for the danger to come.</span></p>

They were able to see some clues. While she was resisting the cold, the underground area of this valley would change as talismans emerged. These talismans would only appear for a split second. No one would notice them if they weren’t paying attention.</span></p>

Perhaps two or three Godkings worked together to do this. Even though no one was personally presiding over it, it was still powerful enough like Zhentian had previously said.</span></p>

They knew what was going on right away, but no one dared to say anything. Some felt a bit of pity. Li Qiye might be strong, but his schemes weren’t a match for Zhentian at all.</span></p>

Such strength was beyond their expectations.</span></p>

There was no need to think further about who the mastermind behind this was.</span></p>

His face didn’t turn red at all as he shook his head: “Fellow Daoist Li, I’m afraid you are gauging the heart of a gentleman with a villainous mind.

These fundamentals are impossible to steal. Zhentian’s laws are only around seventy percent of the true laws, there is still a certain gap between his and the real deal. However, because of his power and great cultivation, it is enough for his attacks to be mighty. Perhaps they are even better than the techniques performed by the sects’ ancestors!”</span></p>

It exerted the maximum limit of power or even the limit above that. Everything turned into ashes before its might. The laws of the grand dao, the power of the world, time and space, and all else were beaten back to the origin.</span></p>

The lines intertwined with each other, making it seem that this whole place could crumble at any moment. It became a vast expanse like the birth of the primordial chaos because the punch had returned everything back to the primal beginning. Objects and laws as well as the fabric of reality were reverted. This was why the stage eventually turned into a vast nothingness.</span></p>

At this moment, he was utterly defeated. It could even be said that he had lost everything and couldn't start fresh anymore. He was still as powerful as before, but this has gone past the point of return. There was no chance for him to surpass this mental blockade. Li Qiye had turned his dream into a nightmare! </span></span><a href="#footnote-9b96">[1]</a></span></p>

This wasn’t something he could ever surpass regardless of how powerful he became in the future. Li Qiye would always be a demon in his nightmare and never allow him to find solace.</span></p>
